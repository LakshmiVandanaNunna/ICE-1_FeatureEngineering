Sunday is almost as nice--just add clouds and include the slightest chance of a late-day shower in extreme NW NC. A front moves through early Monday with a few showers late Sunday night into Monday morning. We\'re back to near-perfect weather Monday afternoon and Tuesday. Another front arrives Wednesday evening with isolated thundershowers possible. Pleasant but cooler weather follows that.\n\n\n\nThe Racoon-O-Meter tells us that MerleFest is just around the corner, September 16-19 in Wilkesboro.

Besides Hurricane Larry (not a factor in our weather), the tropics are quiet for a while. Dry high pressure dominates our weather with a couple of minor exceptions.\n\n\n\nToday continues our run of terrific weather. Sunday is almost as nice, just add clouds and include the slightest chance of a late-day shower in extreme NW NC (the NW Ashe County).\n\n\n\nA front moves through Monday morning from the NW. With it, we have a few showers in the area late Sunday night into Monday morning.\n\n\n\nClouds decrease late Monday leading to a terrific Tuesday.\n\n\n\nA second front arrives Wednesday. It\'s moisture-starved with no more than isolated PM thundershowers.\n\n\n\nCooler high pressure overtakes the region Thursday and Friday. We\'ll be on "Easy Street" for a while with warmer weather returning the following week.\n\nAnnouncements\n\nFirst, all data and forecasts on RaysWeather.Com are the intellectual property of RaysWeather.com, Inc.
