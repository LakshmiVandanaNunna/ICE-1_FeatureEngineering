A front moves through from the NW Monday morning with a few showers after midnight and into Monday morning--not a big deal at all. Pleasant weather returns Labor Day afternoon and continues through Tuesday. We have a dry week ahead; the only other chance of rain is a very small one Wednesday afternoon. Slightly cooler air arrives Thursday.\n\n\n\nThe Racoon-O-Meter tells us that MerleFest is just around the corner, September 16-19 in Wilkesboro.

Two fronts move through this week, but rain is sparse.\n\n\n\nA front moves through from the northwest early Monday. Clouds increase today, and we have an ever-so-slight chance of a renegade shower late today in the NW corner of NC and also along the TN/NC border. A broken line of showers moves through after midnight. A stray shower or two may linger into Monday morning.\n\n\n\nMonday afternoon through Wednesday morning we are between fronts--high, dry, and pleasant.\n\n\n\nThe second front moves through Wednesday evening. It is moisture starved with only a renegade thundershower possible Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\n\nCooler high pressure takes over Thursday, nothing dramatic. As the center of high pressure drifts Appalachians later this week. temperatures will rebound a little Saturday. It\'s near-perfect weather for being outdoors.\n\nAnnouncements\n\nFirst, all data and forecasts on RaysWeather.Com are the intellectual property of RaysWeather.com, Inc.
