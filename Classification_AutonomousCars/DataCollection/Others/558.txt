b'Cocoa butter composition\n\nPrior to any refining, the fatty-acid composition of the CB used in this study was determined by gas-liquid chromatography. The CB used in this study is mainly composed of stearic acid (37.3%), palmitic acid (25.4%), and oleic acid (33.5%) (Supplementary Table 1), which closely matches typical literature values4. The phosphorus content of the unrefined CB is 88 \xc2\xb1 1 ppm, or 0.263 \xc2\xb1 0.004% equivalent phosphatides by weight (Supplementary Table 2), which is similar to the 0.34 \xc2\xb1 0.07% reported by Arruda and Dimick6. After refining, the phospholipids are completely removed from the CB. The FFA content of the unrefined CB is 1.65 \xc2\xb1 0.01% (as oleic acid) (Supplementary Table 3), which complies with the requirement of having <1.75% FFAs as oleic acid in Codex standards. This is reduced to 0.06% after neutralization and bleaching.\n\nCrystal structure and polymorphism\n\nPowder X-ray diffraction is the most unambiguous method for determining CB TAG polymorphism. In this study, CB samples were melted at 80 \xc2\xb0C for 30 min to clear the memory of crystallization and then crystallized statically at 23 \xc2\xb0C in an incubator for 1 day. Form IV displays wide-angle reflections corresponding to short spacings of 4.35, 4.15, 3.97, and 3.81 \xc3\x85, Form V has short spacings of 4.58, 3.98, 3.87, 3.75, and 3.67 \xc3\x85, while Form VI has short spacings of 4.59, 3.86, and 3.70 \xc3\x8510. Unrefined CB displays reflections corresponding to short spacings of 4.61, 3.88, and 3.71 \xc3\x85, which is characteristic of Form VI, matching literature values closely (Fig. 1; Supplementary Table 4)10. Additionally, the small-angle reflections corresponding to long spacings of 68.16 and 32.89 \xc3\x85 further suggest a Form VI polymorphism and a 3 L structure (polytype)11. CB TAGs in Forms V and VI stack as lamellae in the [001] direction with a dimension, which is proportional to three fatty-acid chain lengths, hence the nomenclature \xe2\x80\x9c3 L\xe2\x80\x9d. Other polymorphic forms stack as 2 L structures, the more common polytypic arrangement12.\n\nFig. 1: Powder X-ray diffraction patterns and differential scanning calorimetric traces (inset) of unrefined native CB, refined CB, and refined CB with added minor lipidic components. Samples included a unrefined native CB, b refined CB, c refined CB with added 0.1% (w/w) dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, and d refined CB with added 0.1% (w/w) dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine. Samples were crystallized statically at 23 \xc2\xb0C for 24 h. Full size image\n\nIn contrast, the refined CB sample displays a pattern that resembles a blend of Forms IV and V. Short spacings of 4.35 and 4.18 \xc3\x85 agree with literature values for Form IV, while 4.60, 3.99, 3.88, and 3.77 \xc3\x85 match those of Form V11. Furthermore, the long spacings include both 2 L (45.20 \xc3\x85) and 3 L (65.57 and 32.69 \xc3\x85) arrangements, indicative of the presence of Forms IV and V, respectively11. Thus, it appears that the removal of minor components in CB through refining drastically changes the crystal structure of CB.\n\nThe wide-angle region of powder XRD spectra of refined CB with minor components added back is generally characteristic of Form V, or a blend of Forms IV and V (Fig. 1c, d and Supplementary Fig. 1 (a\xe2\x80\x93f)). In the small-angle region, diffraction patterns suggest that the 3 L structure is present in all samples. Long spacings in the range 64\xe2\x80\x9368 \xc3\x85 correspond to the reflections of the (001) crystal plane. Higher-order reflections, up to ones corresponding to the (009) plane of this lamellar crystal, are also evident. However, there is also varying amounts of the 2 L structure present in the various samples, specifically Form IV, which imparts undesirable properties and stability to CB and chocolate, including a low melting point and excessive softness12. The DMPC, GMP, GMO, and FFA samples have little to no 2 L structure present, indicated by the lack of a (001) plane reflection corresponding to ~45 \xc3\x85. In contrast, DPPE and GMS CB samples display a strong 2 L reflection, suggesting a mixture of 2 L and 3 L structures.\n\nMelting point and enthalpy of fusion\n\nThe melting points and enthalpies of fusion determined by DSC were compared across the CB samples and are shown in Table 1. Example DSC curves are presented for each sample in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2. Wille and Lutton reported the melting temperatures for Forms I through VI as 17.3, 23.3. 25.5, 27.5, 33.9, and 36.3 \xc2\xb0C10, while Lovegren et al.13 reported lower melting temperatures for the same six polymorphs as 13, 20, 23, 25, 30, and 33.5 \xc2\xb0C. The melting point of the unrefined CB used in our study closely matches that of Form VI, as reported by Willie and Lutton10. However, once the CB is refined, the melting point drops to 28.8 \xc2\xb0C, indicative of Form IV. After adding specific minor components back into the refined CB, the melting temperature increases again. Phospholipid and MAG addition to refined CB yield samples with melting points in the range of 29.8\xe2\x80\x9332.2 \xc2\xb0C, suggesting that the CB crystals are in transition from Form IV to Form V, as reported by Wille and Lutton10. Finally, when FFAs are added to refined CB, the melting temperature increases back to about 34 \xc2\xb0C, which may indicate a mixture of Forms V and VI, as it is also similar to Form VI\xe2\x80\x99s melting point of 33.5 \xc2\xb0C13. These results are all in agreement with the XRD data.\n\nTable 1 Melting point and enthalpy of fusion of unrefined native CB, refined CB, and refined CB with added minor lipidic components. Full size table\n\nThe enthalpies of fusion follow a similar trend, with a higher enthalpy of fusion (143.9 J/g) for unrefined CB, which decreases significantly after refining (110.9 J/g). Again, the phospholipids and MAGs have a much smaller effect, if any, compared to the FFAs. With the FFA samples, the enthalpies of fusion are similar to that of the unrefined CB. Guthrie reported an enthalpy of 147 J/g for Form V CB, which decreased for less stable forms14.\n\nCrystallization kinetics\n\nThe crystallization kinetics of the CB samples were quantified using half-times derived from the Avrami model fitted to the SFC-temperature data, as shown in Fig. 2, with the calculated Avrami constants shown in Supplementary Table 515.\n\nFig. 2: Static crystallization growth curve of unrefined native CB, refined CB, and refined CB with added minor lipidic components crystallized at 23 \xc2\xb0C (symbols) and corresponding fits to the Avrami model (solid lines). The inset table indicates the half-times of crystallization derived form model fits. Refining CB accelerates its crystallization (a), as does 0.1% (w/w) phospholipid addition (b). Addition of 0.5% (w/w) saturated monoacylglycerols, glycerol monostearate, and glycerol monopalmitate, do not significantly affect crystallization kinetics, while addition of the unsaturated glycerol monooletate does (c). Free fatty-acid addition to refined CB at 0.5% (w/w) levels accelerates crystallization for stearic, palmitic, and oleic acids equally (d). Values represent means and standard errors of three replicates and values with the same superscript letter are not significantly different (P > 0.05). Full size image\n\nUnrefined CB has the longest half-time of crystallization at 281.9 min, which decreases to 202.3 min after refining. Statistically significant decreases (P < 0.05) in the half time of crystallization of unrefined CB are observed after addition of DMPC, DPPE, GMO, and all free fatty acids tested, including palmitic, stearic, and oleic acids. Chaiseri and Dimick reported that different phospholipids had different effects on crystallization rate, with certain phospholipids such as lysophosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol retarding nucleation, while others such as phosphatidylcholine promoting nucleation. They also highlighted that removing phospholipids through refining decreased the crystallization rate, indicating that phospholids may be necessary as initial crystallization seeds in CB1. This agrees with the data presented in this study, with the addition of phospholipids increasing crystallization rate. Arruda and Dimick reported a much higher relative concentration of phospholipids in seed crystals than in bulk CB, with the majority being phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine6. Thus, it appears that the added phospholipids may aid in the nucleation of CB TAGs.\n\nThe FFA and GMO CB samples have a slightly shorter half-time of crystallization relative to the refined CB sample, but the effects of palmitic and oleic acid are not statistically significant (P > 0.05). M\xc3\xbcller and Careglio focused their study specifically on FFAs, and reported slower crystal growth of unrefined CB with added stearic, palmitic, and oleic acids7. However, we do not observe this in our study. Chaiseri and Dimick reported that saturated free fatty acids increased the crystallization rate in the early stages of CB crystallization1.\n\nFew studies have been conducted on the effect of MAGs on CB crystallization. Chaiseri and Dimick suggested that their effects are small due to their low concentration in CB1. In our study, GMS and GMP, both saturated monoglycerides, do not significantly affect CB crystallization kinetics. Surprisingly, the unsaturated monoglyceride GMO enhances CB crystallization.\n\nPolarized light microscopy\n\nLight microscopy revealed subtle differences in the microstructure of the different CB samples (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 3). Although all images display feather-like spherulitic structures, the unrefined sample has smaller spherulites. DPPE addition, interestingly, leads to the formation of larger spherulites with a different texture than upon DMPC addition. The spherulites of the refined and DPPE samples display granular structures in the centre of the spherulites and feather-like crystallites in the periphery. The MAG samples all exhibit similar crystal morphologies, with both granular structures and small feather-like spherulites present. This is similar to the stearic and palmitic acid samples, though the FFA samples display a more granular structure. It appears that the MAG and FFA samples, excluding the oleic acid sample, revert the CB to the morphology of the unrefined sample. However, the oleic acid sample differs greatly from the rest, displaying large spherulites analogous to the refined CB sample.\n\nFig. 3: Polarized light microscopy images of unrefined native CB, refined CB, and refined CB with and without added minor lipidic components. Samples included a unrefined native CB, b refined CB, c refined CB with added 0.1% (w/w) dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, and d refined CB with added 0.1% (w/w) dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine. Samples were crystallized statically at 23 \xc2\xb0C for 24 h. Intensity and contrast were auto-levelled. Full size image\n\nAn aspect that became clear during the microscopy studies is that the spatial distribution of mass of CB is affected by the refining process and subsequent addition of minor lipidic components. One way to quantify this spatial distribution of mass is by determining the box-counting fractal dimension (D box ) of the images. A high fractal dimension is associated with a greater fill of the available embedding space with crystalline mass, as well as a higher order in the distribution of this crystalline mass. The box-counting fractal dimension provides a value that quantifies the level of space-filling, as well as self-similarity within a structure, which can be related to the nucleation process of CB. Supplementary Table 6 lists these values. The unrefined and stearic acid samples have the lowest average fractal dimension, with D box = 1.63 and 1.62, respectively. In contrast, the sample with the highest fractal dimension is the refined sample at D box = 1.75, followed by the phospholipid samples at ~1.72. Samples with a higher fractal dimension are expected to have originated from a higher nucleation rate, as this leads to more homogenous growth across an area. On the other hand, slower nucleation rates would result in more heterogeneous growth, leading to a lower fractal dimension for the resulting mass distribution 16.\n\nInterestingly, here we also discovered a statistically significant (r = 0.77, P < 0.01) inverse correlation between the melting temperature of the samples and their fractal dimension, as shown in Fig. 4. This may be related to the polymorphism of each sample and its corresponding nucleation process. For the unrefined sample, a high melting temperature of 36.4 \xc2\xb0C indicates the presence of the Form VI polymorph. The higher free energy of nucleation for this most stable polymorph results in low nucleation rates, leading to a more heterogeneous mass distribution and a lower fractal dimension. Conversely, the lower melting temperature of the refined sample suggests a mixture of Forms IV and V, which are metastable polymorphs. These polymorphic forms have greater rates of nucleation, resulting in a more homogeneous mass distribution and a higher fractal dimension16.\n\nFig. 4: Global relationship between the box-counting fractal dimension (D box ) of polarized light microscopy images of CB samples and their corresponding melting temperature (T m ). Fractal dimension values plotted represent the means of six images, while melting temperature values plotted represent the means of three replicates. Full size image\n\nMechanical properties\n\nThe hardness of both CB and chocolate samples containing some of the minor components was determined by 3-point bending, and the elastic bending modulus calculated. The elastic bending moduli (E B ) of unrefined CB, refined CB, and DMPC CB are 44.1 \xc2\xb1 3.4, 35.4 \xc2\xb1 4.4, and 39.0 \xc2\xb1 3.7 N/mm2, respectively. There is no statistically significant difference between these values (P > 0.05). The melting temperatures for these samples are the same as well, with the average being 34.3 \xc2\xb1 0.1 \xc2\xb0C.\n\nFor the chocolate samples, the addition of phospholipids to molten commercial chocolate (90% cocoa solids) allows the chocolate to maintain hardness without complex tempering procedures, such as crystallization at 5 \xc2\xb0C for 1 h and subsequent storage at 20 \xc2\xb0C for 4 days. Other trials with static crystallization at 23 and 26 \xc2\xb0C yield chocolates with undesirable mechanical and surface properties, suggesting that the use of phospholipids to promote proper tempering still requires some optimization of crystallization temperatures. DMPC and DPPE were added chocolate at 0.1% (w/w) levels, and their properties were compared to commercial chocolate both directly from the package and recrystallized under the same conditions as the doped samples (Table 2). The E B is similar between the commercial chocolate and the phospholipid-containing samples, but is significantly lower for the recrystallized commercial chocolate (P < 0.05). When the chocolate is melted and recrystallized without any additive addition, it becomes much softer. A greater E B indicates a stiffer chocolate, relating to the property of snap, which is desirable in chocolate. However, DSC analysis revealed that all the chocolate samples have similar melting temperatures, all indicative of Form V CB crystals. XRD patterns further confirm the presence of Form V CB crystals in all samples (Fig. 5). Thus, it appears that the polymorphism of CB in chocolate does not wholly determine its mechanical properties, and these mechanical properties may be attributed to the microstructure instead.\n\nTable 2 Elastic bending modulus (E B ), melting temperature, and whiteness index (WI) of commercial chocolate samples with added phospholipids. Full size table\n\nFig. 5: Powder X-ray diffraction patterns for commercial chocolate with added minor lipidic components. Chocolate samples were molten, blended with the minor components and crystallized at 5 \xc2\xb0C for 1 h, followed by 20 \xc2\xb0C for 4 days. The a commercial chocolate, b molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate, c molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added 0.1% (w/w) dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, and d molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added 0.1% (w/w) dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine, all display powder X-ray diffraction patterns characteristic of well-tempered \xce\xb2 2 , triclinic, Form V cocoa butter crystals. This crystal form displays a strong reflection corresponding to a short spacing of ~4.6 \xc3\x85 in the wide-angle diffraction region, and characteristic wide-angle reflections in the 2\xce\xb8 region 20\xe2\x80\x9325\xc2\xb0. In the small-angle diffraction region, only reflections from the 3 L (001) plane corresponding to ~62\xe2\x80\x9363-\xc3\x85 were observed. The absence of reflections from (001) plane of the 2 L polytype indicates the formation of the optimal polytypic form in the cocoa butter in all samples. Reflections at higher angles in the small-angle region correspond to higher-order reflections for these two crystal planes. Full size image\n\nProper chocolate tempering typically focuses on the melting behavior of the chocolate, in other words, the polymorphism of the chocolate\xe2\x80\x99s CB triacylglycerol crystals2,3. However, there is little consideration for the microstructure and mechanical properties when determining whether chocolate has been properly tempered or not. Here we show that addition of DMPC and DPPE helps achieve the desired hardness and fracture properties in chocolate, without directly impacting the polymorphism. This likely results from changes in the microstructure of the underlying CB fat crystal network, which arises from the phospholipids affecting the nucleation behavior of the CB.\n\nSurface reflectance\n\nProper tempering of chocolate results in a smooth surface with high surface gloss17. Bloom, for example, is often characterized by the appearance of a grayish white film on the surface of chocolate, attributed to the uncontrolled polymorphic transformation from Form V to Form VI18. This white appearance is due to the presence of large surface crystals, which scatter light impinging upon them19. This can be quantified using the Whiteness Index (WI), calculated from RGB surface color measurements17. A higher WI indicates a greater level of fat bloom on the surface of the chocolate, or may also indicate a rougher surface. The WI for each of the chocolate samples is shown in Table 2. The commercial chocolate and the DMPC chocolate sample have similar WI, suggesting a properly tempered chocolate for the DMPC sample. Moreover, a statistically significant difference is evident between the DMPC chocolate sample and the recrystallized commercial chocolate sample (P < 0.05), which was not tempered properly. The lower WI of the DMPC chocolate sample suggests that the addition of this phospholipid aided in the stability of the chocolate, resulting in less fat bloom and/or a smoother surface compared to the recrystallized commercial chocolate sample. The effect of DPPE addition to molten and recrystallized chocolate is not as clear since the WI is not statistically different from the commercial, DMPC or molten and recrystallized chocolates.\n\nChocolate microstructure by synchrotron-based micro-computed tomography (SR-\xc2\xb5CT)\n\nSynchrotron \xc2\xb5CT analysis revealed similarities between chocolate microstructure among all samples imaged at a <450 \xc2\xb5m length scale. CT voxel intensity is directly proportional to material density. The number of voxels with a given intensity is then representative of the number of volume fractions with a given density in the analyzed volume. The molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate sample (Lindt-R) displays the largest difference between samples, with a narrowing and shift of the histogram compared to the fresh commercial chocolate (Lindt-F), molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added DMPC, and molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added DPPE. This indicates a difference in material structure upon recrystallization. This is visually represented in volume renderings where the most notable difference is a reduction in the green intensity for Lindt-R, compared to the Lindt-F, DMPC, and DPPE samples, as seen in Fig. 6. Volume rendering movies of each sample can be seen in the corresponding links in Fig. 6.\n\nFig. 6: Volume renderings of reconstructed slices, plotted histograms, and correlation matrix of SR-\xc2\xb5CT data. Samples included a molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added 0.1% (w/w) dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC), Supplementary Movie 1; b molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added 0.1% (w/w) dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DPPE), Supplementary Movie 2; c fresh commercial chocolate (Lindt-F), Supplementary Movie 3; d molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate (Lindt-R), Supplementary Movie 4; e plotted histograms, and f correlation matrix. Full size image\n\nA comparison of the histograms shows qualitative differences in the overall density distributions, which make up the sample volumes in the images. A correlation matrix was generated by inputting the voxel count values for each binned 16-bit gray-value and generating a table of correlation coefficients between the four chocolates density distributions. The correlation matrices show a high positive correlation in the material\xe2\x80\x99s density distribution regardless of treatment; however, the least variance is observed between DMPC vs. Lindt-F and DPPE vs. Lindt-F. The highest correlation coefficient is found between DMPC and fresh Lindt, and DPPE vs. fresh Lindt samples, with a value of 0.9987. This suggests that the complex microstructure of Lindt chocolate with added DMPC and DPPE and crystallized isothermally, is more similar to that of tempered fresh Lindt chocolate than without these additives.\n\nOverall, we find that the presence of various minor components within CB results in major changes to its polymorphism, crystallization kinetics, and crystal morphology. By refining CB through neutralization and bleaching, the unrefined CB transitioned from Form VI to a blend of Forms IV and V, in addition to displaying faster crystal growth. Although adding MAGs and FFAs back into refined CB results in some small differences, phospholipid addition has the largest impact.\n\nAt 0.1% (w/w) levels, DMPC and DPPE both significantly increase the crystal growth rate of refined CB. However, the DPPE sample exhibits significant amounts of the 2 L polytype, while the DMPC sample only displays 3 L polytypism, which is the more stable and preferred nanostructure. When added to a commercial chocolate sample, DMPC and DPPE both template the Form V polymorph with optimal mechanical properties, surface gloss and microstructure. This may allow for the production of chocolate products without the need for laborious and complex tempering protocols.\n\nProper tempering is often judged by the resulting melting temperature, a function of the CB polymorphic form2. However, as we show in this study, the various chocolate samples were all in Form V as determined by DSC and XRD analysis, but display different mechanical properties. This suggests that there is more to tempering than achieving the Form V polymorph, and important qualities such as gloss and snap may be heavily dependent on surface and bulk microstructure. Thus, DMPC, DPPE, and possibly other saturated phospholipids can potentially be employed as effective additives for engineering the crystallization behavior, polymorphism, nanostructure, and microstructure in CB and chocolate products.'
