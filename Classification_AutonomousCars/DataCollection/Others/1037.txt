Trying not to break character here). The enigmatic retired golfer was quick to reply with a warm message of his own.\n\nLove you Rory. Thanks for the kind words. Look forward to playing with you all real soon. https://t.co/HhRLqvFfft \xe2\x80\x94 Adam Sandler (@AdamSandler) September 1, 2021\n\nPro tip, Rory: Just say no to the ninth green at nine.'
