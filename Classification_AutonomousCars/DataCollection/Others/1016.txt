b'All humans have a tendency to be a bit more like Eeyore than Tigger, to ruminate more on bad experiences than positive ones. It\xe2\x80\x99s an evolutionary adaptation \xe2\x80\x94 over-learning from the dangerous or hurtful situations we encounter through life (bullying, trauma, betrayal) helps us avoid them in the future and react quickly in a crisis.\n\nBut that means you have to work a little harder to train your brain to conquer negative thoughts. Here\xe2\x80\x99s how:\n\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t try to stop negative thoughts. Telling yourself \xe2\x80\x9cI have to stop thinking about this,\xe2\x80\x9d only makes you think about it more. Instead, own your worries. When you are in a negative cycle, acknowledge it. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m worrying about money.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m obsessing about problems at work.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTreat yourself like a friend. When you are feeling negative about yourself, ask yourself what advice would you give a friend who was down on herself. Now try to apply that advice to you.\n\nChallenge your negative thoughts. Socratic questioning is the process of challenging and changing irrational thoughts. Studies show that this method can reduce depression symptoms. The goal is to get you from a negative mindset (\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a failure.\xe2\x80\x9d) to a more positive one (\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had a lot of success in my career. This is just one setback that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t reflect on me. I can learn from it and be better.\xe2\x80\x9d) Here are some examples of questions you can ask yourself to challenge negative thinking.\n\nFirst, write down your negative thought, such as \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m having problems at work and am questioning my abilities.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThen ask yourself: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the evidence for this thought?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I basing this on facts? Or feelings?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould I be misinterpreting the situation?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow might other people view the situation differently?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow might I view this situation if it happened to someone else?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe bottom line: Negative thinking happens to all of us, but if we recognize it and challenge that thinking, we are taking a big step toward a happier life.'
