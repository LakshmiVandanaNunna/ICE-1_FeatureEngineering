Announcement.\n\nHappy is a parser generator system for Haskell, similar to the tool `yacc' for C. Like `yacc', it takes a file containing an annotated BNF specification of a grammar and produces a Haskell module containing a parser for the grammar.\n\nHappy is flexible: you can have several Happy parsers in the same program, and several entry points to a single grammar. Happy can work in conjunction with a lexical analyser supplied by the user (either hand-written or generated by another program), or it can parse a stream of characters directly (but this isn't practical in most cases).\n\nAs of version 1.5, Happy is capable of parsing full Haskell. We have a Haskell parser that uses Happy, which will shortly be part of the library collection distributed with GHC.\n\nHappy is part of the Haskell Platform, so if you install the platform you will automatically have a working Happy.\n\nHappy is also on Hackage. If you have the cabal-install tool (which also comes with the Haskell Platform), then you can build and install the latest version of Happy with\n\ncabal install happy\n\nTo find out what the latest version of Happy is, and to download the source separately, go to Happy's HackageDB page.\n\nHappy might also be pre-packaged for your OS:\n\nUbuntu users: packages should be available from the universe repository.\n\nDebian GNU/Linux users: packages are available here\n\nRPMs for other versions of Linux can be built directly from the source, using rpmbuild -ta .\n\n. FreeBSD/x86 users: Happy is in the ports tree, so either pkg_add -r hs-happy , or install it from the ports tree in /usr/ports/devel/hs-happy .\n\n, or install it from the ports tree in . OpenBSD users: Happy is in the -current ports tree, you can install it from /usr/ports/devel/happy .\n\nHappy is licensed under a BSD-style license. The current sources are in a Darcs repository, to get the latest version say:\n\ndarcs get http://darcs.haskell.org/happy/\n\nFeel free to hack on Happy and darcs send me your patches.\n\nAuthors\n\nHappy versions up to 0.9 were written by Andy Gill and Simon Marlow.\n\nAll improvements since 0.9 are by Simon Marlow (and various other contributors).\n\nExtra"
