b'DETROIT \xe2\x80\x93 Temperature-wise, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be a pleasant day with afternoon highs reaching the upper 70s (26 degrees Celsius), with a south wind at 5 to 10 mph and a few gusts higher than that.\n\nAs mentioned above, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have scattered light showers tonight, with lows in the low to middle 60s (16 to 17 degrees Celsius). Southwest wind at 5 to 10 mph will shift to the northwest later at night after a cold front swings by.\n\nAny lingering clouds behind the cold front first thing Sunday morning will move out, and the day should become mostly sunny and a little breezy. Highs in the upper 70s to near 80 degrees (26 to 27 degrees Celsius), with a west wind developing at 10 to 15 mph.\n\nPartly cloudy Sunday night, with a scattered shower possible in the Thumb. Lows in the upper 50s (14 to 15 degrees Celsius).\n\nMostly sunny on Labor Day\xe2\x80\xa6nice weather for a day off for most, and the evening start of Rosh Hashanah for some! Highs in the upper 70s (26 degrees Celsius).\n\nAd\n\nMostly clear Monday night, with lows near 60 degrees (15 to 16 degrees Celsius).\n\nTuesday starts mostly sunny (good news for those going to Rosh Hashanah morning services), but a potent cold front approaching in the afternoon will trigger some showers and thunderstorms\xe2\x80\xa6possibly even some strong storms based upon some upper air forecast model data I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen this morning (bad news for those going to Rosh Hashanah family dinners). Highs ahead of the front should surge into the low to mid 80s (28 to 29 degrees Celsius), unless it clouds up earlier than expected. It\xe2\x80\x99ll also become a windy day.\n\nShowers and storms end Tuesday night, with lows in the upper 50s (14 to 15 degrees Celsius).\n\nBreezy and cool on Wednesday\xe2\x80\xa6a nice taste of fall\xe2\x80\xa6with highs in the low to mid 70s (22 to 24 degrees Celsius), and a scattered afternoon shower possible\xe2\x80\xa6especially over the northern part of the area.\n\nThursday through the weekend all look dry, with highs rising from the mid 70s (23 degrees Celsius) on Thursday to near 80 degrees (27 degrees Celsius) next weekend. If the pattern evolution I see shaping up pans out, next weekend could be really nice\xe2\x80\xa6although there will be a front to our north, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to get too excited yet about a forecast eight-to-nine days out.\n\nAd\n\nTRACKING THE WEATHER:\n\n\xc2\xb7 Track the live Michigan Weather Radar here\n\n\xc2\xb7 Track severe weather alerts here\n\n\xc2\xb7 Submit storm photos here\n\nRemember to download the FREE Local4Casters weather app -- it\xe2\x80\x99s easily one of the best in the nation.
