b'Saturday, September 4th, 5:30 P.M.\n\nAfter a smoky start for some of us, it turned into a clear and warm day across the metro area. We topped out at 88 in Portland, our warmest day in three weeks! Some Cascade fire smoke drifted down into the eastern half of the Willamette Valley, this becomes common in early fall with long nights and developing inversions each of those nights. Then with light westerly wind, skies turn more clear and air quality improves. Gresham had UNHEALTHLY air quality this morning, but that that is back in the GOOD category this afternoon. Terrible air quality continues east of the Cascades; Sisters has seen the worst air-quality (so far this season) today. Westerly wind keeps us mainly smoke-free tomorrow and Monday.\n\nTemperatures remain warm through Tuesday, just cooling a few degrees tomorrow then warming again Monday/Tuesday. Onshore flow and a few weak weather systems moving through give us more typical fall weather for the 2nd half of the week; more cloud cover and cooler temps.\n\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s no sign of a significant soaking coming up, but we could easily see a few showers Tuesday night or early Wednesday morning.'
