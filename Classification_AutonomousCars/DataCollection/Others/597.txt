The company has yet to release more details about the launch of its new bars. LIVEKINDLY has reached out for additional details.\n\nHershey\xe2\x80\x99s launches vegan chocolate bars\n\nThe chocolate company first hinted at vegan chocolate bars in February. The brand revealed plans to launch vegan and dairy-free candies as part of its \xe2\x80\x9cBetter-for-You\xe2\x80\x9d initiative.\n\nThe company didn\xe2\x80\x99t specify what kind of vegan products it would launch. But, in a press release, it revealed the company planned to \xe2\x80\x9cexpand its future portfolio to deliver more reduced sugar, organic and plant-based alternatives while also continuing to build its classic array of beloved products.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHershey\xe2\x80\x99s isn\xe2\x80\x99t the first candy giant to release vegan chocolate bars. In June, Nestl\xc3\xa9 launched vegan KitKats, called KitKat V, in the U.K.-based supermarket Sainsbury\xe2\x80\x99s. The non-dairy treats feature a crisp wafer covered in rice milk chocolate.\n\nLouise Barrett, Head of the Nestl\xc3\xa9 Confectionery Product Technology Centre, said the company \xe2\x80\x9cworked very hard to get the right balance between the milk alternative and the cocoa. The result is a vegan chocolate that we\xe2\x80\x99re very proud of, and that we hope will be enjoyed by KitKat fans everywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA number of vegan companies are also churning out dairy-free chocolate bars. Go Max Go makes non-dairy versions of classic chocolate bars, including Snickers, Twix, and Milky Way. Nelly\xe2\x80\x99s Organics makes vegan, fair trade candy bars in varieties like peanut butter coconut and caramel nougat.
