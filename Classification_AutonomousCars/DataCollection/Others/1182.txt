b"Cheryl McCormick thought her neighbor across the street was dead.\n\nAs a tornado bore down on Barlow Avenue in Deptford Township on Wednesday evening, McCormick received a text from her worried neighbor.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe had texted me and said \xe2\x80\x98Wave to me, I\xe2\x80\x99m in the bay window. I\xe2\x80\x99m scared,\xe2\x80\x99 McCormick said. \xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as she said that, that\xe2\x80\x99s when all hell broke loose.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThey saw the twister coming across Tanyard Road toward their homes.\n\nThe EF-3 tornado that blasted Gloucester County with winds of up to 150 mph on Wednesday, obliterating homes and toppling farm silos, tore a more than 12-mile path from Harrisonville to Deptford Township over the course of 20 minutes, first touching down at 6:10 p.m., the National Weather Service reported. This was only the fifth EF-3 or F-3 (an older scale) tornado ever confirmed in New Jersey since detailed records started in 1950, according to the National Weather Service\xe2\x80\x99s storm database.\n\n[1:30 PM] A significant tornado occurred on 9/1 in a portion of Gloucester County, NJ. This tornado produced extensive... Posted by US National Weather Service Philadelphia/Mount Holly on Friday, September 3, 2021\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt looked like a million birds in the sky, but you could see it was debris,\xe2\x80\x9d McCormick said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou could see trash cans flying in the air. My neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s gazebo went up and went around in circles up in the air.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe retreated to the basement with her two kids and three other adults.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt sounded like a freight train coming through this house,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou could hear everything crashing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMeanwhile, the neighbor across the street was trying to get her dogs and seek shelter in a bathroom when the powerful winds hit her home.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe actually was sucked through her house,\xe2\x80\x9d McCormick said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe next thing she remembered, she was laying between her couch and her coffee table, and her face was full of blood.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe bay window where she had been standing moments earlier was blown out into the yard, along with the whole front wall of the house.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s so lucky,\xe2\x80\x9d McCormick said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe first thing I thought when I saw her house was, she\xe2\x80\x99s dead. There was no way I thought that she made it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe neighbor, who declined to be interviewed for this story, was taken to an emergency room for treatment of cuts and bruises and was diagnosed with a concussion, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t need to be hospitalized, McCormick said.\n\nThe woman\xe2\x80\x99s house has been condemned, downed trees are everywhere and the power remained out as of Friday afternoon.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBarlow Avenue used to be beautiful,\xe2\x80\x9d McCormick said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou come down now and it\xe2\x80\x99s just all open skies. Every tree in our backyard is down.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSomehow, McCormick\xe2\x80\x99s house emerged unscathed and she is grateful.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll of our guardian angels must have stood around our house and protected it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\n\nAfter causing extensive damage in Harrison Township, where some houses in one neighborhood were ripped to shreds and two farms suffered heavy damage, the twister continued into neighboring communities, including Mantua, Wenonah, Deptford and Woodbury Heights.\n\nIn Deptford Township, Mayor Paul Medany said the storm devastated several local neighborhoods and left at least four homeowners displaced.\n\nDeptford Police reported that the motor vehicle inspection station on Tanyard Road was closed Friday because of blocked roads.\n\nOn Hammond Avenue, close to the township\xe2\x80\x99s border with Wenonah resident Dawn Carter was in the kitchen when the lights went out.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything got real silent and I heard what sounded like a train coming. My house started to shake and it just got louder,\xe2\x80\x9d Carter said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt sounded like a freight train ran over my house.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe raced for shelter.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ran to the basement and my cat beat me down there,\xe2\x80\x9d she chuckled. She\xe2\x80\x99s thankful they both survived and is still stunned by the idea that she was home as the storm plowed through her neighborhood. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the part I\xe2\x80\x99m still trying to deal with.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t imagine what was happening outside as she waited for the chaos to pass.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard a crash in my house and I did not realize the damage that was done to the house until I got outside.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAn enormous oak tree had fallen on her home, flattening the garage. Thankfully, her car was parked on the street.\n\nHere's what Dawn Carter's home on Hammond Avenue looked like before an oak tree was removed from the crushed remains of her garage.(Photo courtesy of Dawn Carter)\n\nBased on the line of damage through the neighborhood, she thinks the twister actually came through her yard. Structures in the nearby borough of Wenonah also suffered significant damage.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was so scary. You don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to ever happen to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA tree service came out and removed the oak from her house and now she needs to work with the insurance company to begin the repair process. She was hoping an adjuster would be out Friday.\n\nShe remains without electricity, as power lines are down in the area. She expects repairs to take a while.\n\nThe township brought out cases of water and is helping residents with phone charging.\n\nCarter has lived in the house since 2005 and is grateful for her neighbors.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEveryone is banding together. They\xe2\x80\x99re great,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cEveryone\xe2\x80\x99s checked on me. The emotional support is really good here.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe garage of Dawn Carter's home in Deptford Township was flattened by a tree that fell during Wednesday's violent weather.Joe Warner | For NJ Advance Media\n\nNo fatalities were reported from the twister, spawned by the remnants of Hurricane Ida, and only a few injuries were recorded across Gloucester County, officials said.\n\nRecovery work will continue through the holiday weekend.\n\nOn Friday, Harrison Township Police urged motorists to avoid the area of Route 322 as cleanup and power restoration efforts continue.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile we understand that Route 322, and the surrounding roadways, to Route 55 are normal travel routes for traffic heading to the shore, we implore all motorists to avoid the area if possible,\xe2\x80\x9d the department posted in a message on Facebook.\n\nThey also had a stern message for sightseers looking to gawk at storm damage.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cComing to the area simply to view the damage and take photographs is not acceptable \xe2\x80\xa6 we kindly ask that all understand the full magnitude of this situation and respect the privacy of the affected families.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe scope of the damage in Harrison Township is becoming more apparent.\n\nAbout 135 houses were damaged in some way and 34 have been declared unsafe, \xe2\x80\x9cmeaning they are already down or need to come down,\xe2\x80\x9d Mayor Lou Manzo said Friday.\n\nElectricity should be restored to most township homes that lost power by late Friday night, he added, and the township is providing resources for residents to begin their cleanups, including dumpsters for building debris.\n\nManzo praised the outpouring of support in the form of volunteers and donations to assist in the recovery effort, including donations from local eateries and hardware stores.\n\nThe support has been so great that they had to pause donations temporarily, he said.\n\nOur journalism needs your support.
