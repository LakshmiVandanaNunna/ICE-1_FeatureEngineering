b"Great Documentary - everyone should watch this film, although the full version (DVD, AMAZON) does have a few pics in it that might not be appropriate for kids.\n\n\n\nI watched the PBS version a few times, and it is shorter. Some of the segments are shorter, the graphic images are cut out, and the section on religion is pretty much eliminated. Nevertheless, I liked some of their edits: The full version got a bit long and boring during some segments, this is the only reason I am withholding a 5 star rating.\n\n\n\nThe information in this film is something that everyone should be exposed to and should be taught. Watching this film once can change your life. Incorporating the ideas of this film into your life WILL change it - and for the better of course!\n\n\n\nIncidentally, I originally DVR'd this, and I have watched it a couple times that way. I rented it from Amazon to show to my Adult Education class at school. I will probably eventually buy the DVD since it is so good - so important - and I'd like all my friends and family (and future students) to see it."
