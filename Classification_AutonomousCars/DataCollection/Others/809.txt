b'If you think chocolate is heavenly, you\'re not alone. Chocolate literally is the "food of the gods" -- that\'s what its botanical name, Theobroma cacao, means. But you needn\'t be divine to indulge. Mere mortals adore chocolate in all its forms, from the humble chocolate chip cookie to gourmet goodies, wintry hot chocolate, and decadent desserts. And to make chocolate even more drool-worthy, researchers are discovering this ancient treat may have some modern health benefits.\n\nQ: When was chocolate first discovered?\n\nA: Chocolate dates back centuries. The Mayans traded valuable cacao beans, from which chocolate is made, as a commodity. In 1519, the Aztecs discovered that they could make a delicious drink by adding water and sweeteners to roasted, ground-up cacao beans. The chocolate bar came along later in the 18th century, by mixing chocolate with milk.\n\nQ: Are all chocolates good for you?\n\nA: Chocolate lovers, rejoice -- but be savvy about chocolate\'s health perks. Chocolate really can be good for you, but not all chocolate is created equally. If you\'re after health benefits, forget the chewy, caramel, marshmallow or cream-covered chocolates and look for solid dark chocolate.'
