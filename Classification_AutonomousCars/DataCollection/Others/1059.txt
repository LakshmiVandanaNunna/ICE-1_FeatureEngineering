b'Good evening. I\xe2\x80\x99m Karen Kaplan, and it\xe2\x80\x99s Friday, Sept. 3. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the latest on what\xe2\x80\x99s happening with the coronavirus in California and beyond.\n\nNewsletter Get our free Coronavirus Today newsletter Sign up for the latest news, best stories and what they mean for you, plus answers to your questions. Enter email address Sign Me Up You may occasionally receive promotional content from the Los Angeles Times.\n\nAs we head into Labor Day weekend, we bring you the tale of two tireless entrepreneurs with a bona fide pandemic hit on their hands.\n\nBut since the coronavirus has a way of flipping everything on its head, theirs isn\xe2\x80\x99t entirely a success story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe pair in question are Melinda Hwang and Ed Fu, the West L.A. couple behind Happy Masks. Their $24 face coverings are all the rage, especially among parents whose kids are old enough to be going back to school but are too young to get vaccinated. Indeed, masks sized for children account for about 80% of the company\xe2\x80\x99s runaway sales.\n\nHwang is a graduate of MIT\xe2\x80\x99s Sloan School of Management and the former marketing director of Capital Group, an investment management firm. Fu has a degree from Harvard Business School and served as chief marketing officer of ZipRecruiter, a hiring website. Despite their credentials, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t set out to create a mask business.\n\nThe masks were developed in Taiwan by a scientist who collaborated with Hwang\xe2\x80\x99s father on a new type of filter for wastewater treatment. The 2003 SARS outbreak prompted the scientist to adapt the filter for use in masks, and when COVID-19 burst onto the scene in 2020, he shared some with friends and family.\n\nHwang, Fu and their three young children wore the masks around their neighborhood. Wearers find that the masks, with a design reminiscent of a parrot\xe2\x80\x99s beak, make it easier to speak and breathe without fogging up one\xe2\x80\x99s glasses. Sewn inside is a nano-fiber membrane filter capable of blocking particles as small as 3 micrometers. (A micrometer is 10,000 times smaller than a centimeter.)\n\nFor the record: An earlier version of this newsletter said a micrometer was only 100 times smaller than a centimeter.\n\nThe masks attracted attention, and soon Hwang was asking her parents if she could get extras for friends, neighbors and other acquaintances. As requests poured in, she realized she had the makings of a business.\n\nHappy Masks founders Melinda Hwang and husband Ed Fu have seen their company\xe2\x80\x99s face coverings become a back-to-school sensation.\n\n(Gary Coronado / Los Angeles Times)\n\nThe masks were in demand from the start. Hwang\xe2\x80\x99s first callout to parents in a Facebook group for one of her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s classes generated orders for more than 1,000 masks.\n\nAfter receiving a glowing online review that said Happy Masks \xe2\x80\x9cfiltered small particles better than many other masks,\xe2\x80\x9d customers bought up the entire inventory.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe harder the masks were to find, the more popular they became. When a new allotment of masks went on sale Aug. 9, about 16,000 would-be customers swarmed the site \xe2\x80\x94 and 90% of them left empty-handed. The same thing happened three days later.\n\nNikki Hart, a mother of two in Culver City, put three masks in her cart within seconds of the Aug. 9 sale getting underway. But by the time she hit the purchase button, her selections were out of stock.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt felt like I was trying to get tickets to the Rolling Stones,\xe2\x80\x9d Hart said.\n\nYou might think this was a good problem for a new company to have. But you\xe2\x80\x99d feel differently if you were fielding hundreds of emails from an angry and frustrated public. Some disgruntled parents posted complaints on Instagram; one critic called Happy Masks \xe2\x80\x9ca marketing scam.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome of the most anguish-inducing messages came from the parents of immunocompromised children, she said.\n\nHwang said the situation left her feeling like she\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x9clet everyone down.\xe2\x80\x9d At one point, she said, the stress caused her to \xe2\x80\x9cburst into tears.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe and Fu have experimented with different ways of allocating masks among customers, with some success. But there will be kinks to work out until they can ramp up their production without sacrificing quality.\n\nPlenty of customers are willing to wait. They want to experience the joy of Laura Gaskill, a mother of two in Naperville, Ill., who has purchased 25 Happy Masks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no higher praise than your 6-year-old wearing a mask all day and forgetting he has it on,\xe2\x80\x9d Gaskill said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve been so grateful to have a little bit of control over something as completely chaotic as COVID.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBy the numbers\n\nCalifornia cases, deaths and vaccinations as of 1:30 p.m. on Friday:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrack California\xe2\x80\x99s coronavirus spread and vaccination efforts \xe2\x80\x94 including the latest numbers and how they break down \xe2\x80\x94 with our graphics.\n\nAnother way the pandemic makes everything harder\n\nCleaning up from a Category 4 hurricane is challenging under any circumstances. But for the people displaced by Ida, which made landfall in Louisiana this week, the pandemic just makes everything even harder.\n\nHospitals that could have been focused on treating storm victims were already brimming with COVID-19 patients. Once the storm hit, the best-equipped medical centers struggled to keep ventilators and other essential machinery functioning on backup generators. Other hospitals had to evacuate their fragile patients.\n\nThree dozen shelters around the state took in nearly 2,000 people displaced by the storm. They struggled to take pandemic precautions, like encouraging masking and social distancing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt one shelter in LaPlace near New Orleans, only one of the two sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s deputies sitting behind a counter wore a face covering. Behavior like that made Dontrell Riley nervous. She opted to take her four children out to the sidewalk rather than wait inside.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI just hope we stay safe and don\xe2\x80\x99t catch COVID,\xe2\x80\x9d Riley said, nudging a blue surgical mask to cover her nose. \xe2\x80\x9cI seen a lot of people here, and I know it\xe2\x80\x99s dangerous.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDemetrice Joseph, left, waits with her family at a makeshift dropoff center in LaPlace, La., after a boat rescued them from their flooded home. (Jennie Jarvie / Los Angeles Times)\n\nDemetrice Joseph also felt safer outside, especially since she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to grab a mask when she left her waterlogged home. Nor did she see any masks at the shelter when she lined up to check in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t want to catch it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said as she and several relatives kept their distance from a growing crowd of evacuees, most not wearing masks. Joseph was particularly concerned about her mother, who has asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. \xe2\x80\x9cMy mom shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be around that many people.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLouisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards spoke forcefully about the COVID-19 threat. In recent weeks, the state \xe2\x80\x94 which has one of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s lowest COVID-19 vaccination rates \xe2\x80\x94 was logging more than 5,000 new coronavirus cases per day.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhether we like it or not, we are still in a COVID environment; it is a very difficult COVID environment, where 100% of our cases are attributable to this Delta variant,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cEverything we\xe2\x80\x99re doing needs to be done with COVID in mind, so it\xe2\x80\x99s important we mask and wash hands and do all of these things to the maximum extent possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThat message apparently didn\xe2\x80\x99t impress Cain Dufrene, the chief of operations for St. John the Baptist Parish Fire Services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be honest with you. ... We really didn\xe2\x80\x99t take too many COVID protocols,\xe2\x80\x9d he said after pulling a 30-hour shift. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re going to save the life rather than trying to worry too much about the COVID stuff.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLike many of the local officials and emergency workers huddled inside the St. John command center, Dufrene did not wear a mask.\n\nCalifornia\xe2\x80\x99s vaccination progress\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSee the latest on California\xe2\x80\x99s vaccination progress with our tracker .\n\nConsider subscribing to the Los Angeles Times Your support helps us deliver the news that matters most.

Health Care Agency formally briefed the Board of Supervisors on the pandemic at one of its public meetings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn L.A. County, the Department of Public Health recently increased the frequency of live COVID-19 press briefings to twice a week. In the O.C., such briefings were suspended for several months.\n\nSupervisor Katrina Foley, a former mayor of Costa Mesa, was concerned that O.C. residents were not getting the facts they needed to combat the rampant misinformation they might be hearing about COVID-19, vaccines and the Delta variant. So on Aug. 9, she launched her own regular COVID-19 news conference.\n\nThe briefings were initially held five days a week, though they\xe2\x80\x99ve dropped in frequency to twice a week. They feature county health officials and other experts, who warned the public that local hospitals were beginning to strain under the Delta surge. They also gave updates on conditions in schools, explained why it\xe2\x80\x99s important to wear masks and offered tips on maximizing safety over the Labor Day weekend.\n\nBut on Thursday, the chair and vice chair of the Board of Supervisors ordered county officials to stop participating in Foley\xe2\x80\x99s briefings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoard Chairman Andrew Do called them political stunts that repeated information already available elsewhere. The Orange County Health Care Agency resumed its own weekly press briefings Aug. 13 \xe2\x80\x94 after Foley\xe2\x80\x99s news conferences had begun.\n\nFoley said she\xe2\x80\x99d continue hosting the briefings without county health officials if necessary. She could try to replace them with experts from the state Department of Public Health. She already features doctors from local hospitals, epidemiologists and other healthcare professionals.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re just trying to give accurate health information out to the community,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think the information that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been sharing has caused more people to question some of the misinformation that\xe2\x80\x99s coming out.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFarther south, officials in San Diego County voted this week to declare medical misinformation a public health crisis \xe2\x80\x94 the first county in the country to do so.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Board of Supervisors took the vote after a 15-hour meeting that included eight hours of public comments, much of it critical of vaccine and mask mandates. The three Democratic supervisors voted in favor of the measure, while the two Republican supervisors voted against it.\n\nSupervisor Nathan Fletcher said the measure was necessary to ensure that false and misleading statements don\xe2\x80\x99t get in the way of doctors\xe2\x80\x99 and nurses\xe2\x80\x99 efforts to treat a rising tide of COVID-19 patients. The Republicans, Jim Desmond and Joel Anderson, said that although they support vaccination efforts, they consider it government overreach to try to referee debate about the pandemic.\n\nSpeaking of vaccines, the L.A. Community College District Board of Trustees has voted to require them for all staff members \xe2\x80\x94 even those working remotely \xe2\x80\x94 and for students attending in-person classes or using campus facilities.\n\nThe vote to revise the policy \xe2\x80\x94 which previously called for either a COVID-19 vaccination or regular coronavirus testing \xe2\x80\x94 is linked to the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s official approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for people 16 and older. It passed 7-1, with trustee Ernest Moreno voting no.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMedical and religious exemptions will be allowed. Those exempted will be required to get tested at least once a week.\n\nIn national news, the Delta variant has thrown us an economic curveball that prompted employers to add just 235,000 new jobs to their payrolls last month. That\xe2\x80\x99s one-third as many as most forecasters were expecting based on hiring trends earlier in the summer. Retail stores and restaurants and drinking places shed jobs last month.\n\nWith Delta walloping unvaccinated Americans and causing problems for groups that had seemed relatively unaffected by earlier strains, the wave of consumer spending that had propelled the recovery has faltered. Many businesses are reconsidering plans to return to their normal operations.\n\nWithout some kind of government action, \xe2\x80\x9cI think the rosy scenario for this fall becomes really dark, really fast,\xe2\x80\x9d said William Spriggs, chief economist for the AFL-CIO, the labor organization.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe employment news comes as the federal government ends four temporary programs that were designed to help those who were unemployed or underemployed weather the pandemic. Those programs were providing more than $1 billion in aid to about 2.2 million Californians as of late August, according to the state Employment Development Department.\n\nGone will be $300 in weekly unemployment benefits that the feds were offering on top of the state\xe2\x80\x99s unemployment insurance. Also disappearing is $839 million in help for gig workers, self-employed people and others who aren\xe2\x80\x99t eligible for unemployment benefits.\n\nAs things stand, the situation will soon get worse: On Sept. 11, the 13- to 20-week extension of federal unemployment benefits will end. At that point, the maximum duration of benefits will be 26 weeks, and those who have already hit that mark will be cut off.\n\nYour questions answered\n\nToday\xe2\x80\x99s question comes from readers who want to know: What is the coronavirus situation in my child\xe2\x80\x99s school?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf your child is a student in L.A. Unified, you\xe2\x80\x99re in luck: We\xe2\x80\x99ve got you covered with our new LAUSD coronavirus tracker!\n\nAs previously discussed, the school district has implemented a $350-million testing program that\xe2\x80\x99s the most ambitious effort of its kind in the country.

The 10-day gathering occurred despite warnings about the highly contagious Delta variant and drew more than half a million people.\n\nExperts feared the rally would become a superspreader event. It looks like they were right.\n\nContact tracers have tied at least 178 coronavirus cases to the event. Those cases are from five states: South Dakota, North Dakota, Wyoming, Minnesota and Wisconsin. Meade County, the nucleus of the rally, is now dealing with a COVID-19 surge, and the region\xe2\x80\x99s largest hospital system went from treating five COVID-19 patients to 78 \xe2\x80\x94 and it\xe2\x80\x99s bracing for more.\n\nTwo bands that performed at the rally were forced to cancel shows after musicians became infected. Corey Taylor, the lead singer of Slipknot, told fans he was \xe2\x80\x9cvery, very sick\xe2\x80\x9d from COVID-19.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the worst I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever been sick in my life,\xe2\x80\x9d Taylor said in a Facebook video this week. \xe2\x80\x9cHad I not been vaccinated, I shudder to think how bad it would have been.\xe2\x80\x9d'
