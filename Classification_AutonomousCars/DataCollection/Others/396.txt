b'For a year or so in high school, I\xe2\x80\x99d buy a peanut butter Kudos bar in the cafeteria at lunch time, then eat it slowly on the walk home. Kudos, for those who never had the pleasure, were a kind of granola-candy bar hybrid made by Mars that debuted in the late \xe2\x80\x9980s. Comprising a granola bar topped by a peanut butter layer pebbled with crispy rice, the whole thing enrobed in waxy chocolate, those slim bars fueled my adolescence.\n\nSo maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s no wonder that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been craving the combination of peanut butter and chocolate as I prepare to send my own children back to school \xe2\x80\x94 real, in-person, full-time school \xe2\x80\x94 for the first time in a long time. Kudos have been long since discontinued, but the appeal of a bar made with good peanut butter and excellent chocolate has not gone out of style among children or their mothers, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to report.\n\nThough these bars are inspired by Kudos, they\xe2\x80\x99re not intended to be a replica. I took some liberties: Instead of a granola bar, I make my version with a simple shortbread crust that\xe2\x80\x99s pressed into the pan with your fingertips; it\xe2\x80\x99s sturdy enough to give the bar structure, but with a tender crumb and an irresistible brown butter flavor. I top the crust with a second layer made from a combination of melted natural peanut butter and milk chocolate into which I stir puffed rice (or, if you prefer, Rice Krispies).\n\nI prefer natural smooth peanut butter for almost everything, these bars included \xe2\x80\x94 the milk chocolate gives the mixture plenty of sweetness, and I like its slightly coarse texture; if you want even more texture, use crunchy peanut butter. Almond butter can also be substituted. The bars are finished with a silky layer of dark chocolate, its bitterness acting as a foil for the sweet peanut butter layer. A dusting of finely chopped peanuts adds another textural element.\n\nI cut the bars into squat, skinny bars. While small, they are mighty, rich and intense. An 8-inch pan yields 32 bars, which will keep you going for a while, each one fueling, perhaps, afternoon homework sessions, sports practices, tedious meetings, or long walks home.\n\nJessica Battilana is a freelance writer and the author of \xe2\x80\x9cRepertoire: All the Recipes You Need.\xe2\x80\x9d Instagram: @jbattilana Email: food@sfchronicle.com Twitter: @jbattilana\n\nPeanut Butter-Chocolate Shortbread Bars\n\nMakes 32 small bars\n\nThe crust\n\n1 cup all-purpose flour\n\n\xc2\xbd teaspoon baking powder\n\nPinch kosher salt\n\n8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature\n\n1 large egg yolk\n\n\xc2\xbd cup granulated sugar\n\nThe peanut butter layer\n\n1 cup natural peanut butter\n\n4 ounces milk chocolate, finely chopped\n\n1 cup plus 2 tablespoons puffed rice or Rice Krispies\n\nThe chocolate layer\n\nFood Guide Top 25 Restaurants Where to eat in the Bay Area.

Lightly grease the parchment paper. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit .\n\nIn a medium bowl whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter on high speed until pale and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula and add the egg yolk and sugar and beat on medium-high until the sugar has dissolved, about 2 minutes more. Transer the dough to the prepared pan and refrigerate for 10 minutes. With your fingertips, press into the pan in an even layer (if the dough sticks to your fingers, wet them). Bake, rotating the pan once, until golden brown on the edges, 25 to 27 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack.\n\nWhile the crust bakes, prepare the peanut butter layer. Combine the peanut butter and chocolate in a medium heat-proof bowl and set over a saucepan of simmering water, ensuring that the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water. Cook, stirring frequently, until the chocolate has melted and the mixture is smooth, then stir in the puffed rice. Remove from the heat (reserve the saucepan of water) and immediately pour the peanut butter layer over the warm shortbread and use a small offset spatula to spread in an even layer. Transfer the pan to the refrigerator and refrigerate until the peanut butter layer is set, about 30 minutes.\n\nReturn the saucepan of water to a simmer for the chocolate layer . In a medium heat-proof bowl, combine the chocolate, corn syrup and butter. Cook, stirring, until the butter and chocolate have melted and the mixture is smooth. Remove from the heat and let cool for a few minutes, then remove the pan from the refrigerator and pour the chocolate mixture over the peanut butter layer, using the offset spatula to spread it into a thin layer that completely covers the peanut butter layer. Scatter the chopped peanuts over, then return to the refrigerator and refrigerate until the chocolate layer is set.\n\nTo serve: Remove the bars from the pan using the parchment paper to help lift. While the bars are still cool, use a sharp knife to cut the bars into 1-inch by 2-inch bars. Let come to room temperature before eating.'
