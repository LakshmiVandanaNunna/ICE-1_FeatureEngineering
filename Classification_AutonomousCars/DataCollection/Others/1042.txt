He has a rectangular head, with pink ears, big black eyes with small, thin eyebrows, and light blue cheek marks near to his tiny whiskers (two on each side of his face). Happy has a triangular nose that leads to semi-round upper lips on the sides. His body is rectangular too, and being an Exceed, it has a structure that allows him to walk erect, unlike normal cats. Despite having no thumbs, Happy is able to hold things.[4] He has a long, white-tipped tail; and the other parts of his tail are blue. Additionally, Happy is able to use his tail to hold onto objects.[5] Happy is usually seen carrying around a green backpack, where he keeps food and items that can be used in battle. This backpack also covers his green Guild Mark that is on his back.[6] When using his Magic, he can grow a pair of large, feathered, angel-like wings that allow him to fly around and carry others. Happy usually does not wear clothes, the only few times being during the Fantasia Parade,[7] to disguise himself in Edolas,[8] and when his parents gave him clothes, again in Edolas.[9]\n\nPersonality\n\nDespite his small stature and eccentric appearance, Happy is very loyal to his teammates and fellow guild members and has a fairly significant amount of knowledge of the Magic world, in some cases, more than Lucy and Natsu. Given that he has been around Natsu Dragneel since his own birth, Happy often emulates Natsu in his actions and responses. He is quick-witted and cheeky, especially to Lucy Heartfilia; however, Happy sometimes shows little bits of a darker side of himself, for example when making a comment on the devastating aspects of the Magic of his comrades.\n\nHe loves fish more than anything else, and he doesn\'t like dogs (except for Plue).[2] He offers a comic relief with his catchphrase, "Aye!" or "Aye Sir!". He holds a respect and admiration to Exceed like himself and drools on Loke\'s shoulder when he finds out that Loke is the celestial spirit of Leo the Lion. Happy has also developed a strong affection towards Carla, another Exceed who at first blows him off, but then begins to like and respect him.\n\nMagic and Abilities\n\nAera ( \xe7\xbf\xbc ( \xe3\x82\xa8\xe3\x83\xbc\xe3\x83\xa9 ) \xc4\x92ra): Happy is able to sprout angelic wings that give him the ability to fly and carry objects or one person at a time for a specific amount of time.[10]\n\nMax Speed (\xe3\x82\xb9\xe3\x83\x94\xe3\x83\xbc\xe3\x83\x89 Makkusu Sup\xc4\xabdo ): Happy utilizes a considerable amount of Magic Power to fly as fast as he can. This speed can be used to dodge incoming attacks or to attack the enemy. A disadvantage of this technique would be a rapid loss of Magic Power, in relation to how long Happy uses this technique. [11] Max Speed Attack : While using Max Speed, Happy flies as fast as he can, and then strikes the opponent with his own head. This attack was powerful enough to destroy a Thunder Palace Lacrima, which was about twice the size of Happy. [12]\n\n(\xe3\x82\xb9\xe3\x83\x94\xe3\x83\xbc\xe3\x83\x89 ): Happy utilizes a considerable amount of Magic Power to fly as fast as he can.

A disadvantage of this technique would be a rapid loss of Magic Power, in relation to how long Happy uses this technique.\n\nTransformation Magic (\xe5\xa4\x89\xe8\xba\xab\xe9\xad\x94\xe6\xb3\x95 Henshin Mah\xc5\x8d): Mirajane taught Happy, Natsu and Lucy basic spells of Transformation Magic.[13] However, Happy is only able to transform into a super deformed version of Lucy. Unfortunately, his attempt was a failure and in Lucy\'s words, "creepy".[14]\n\nEnhanced Durability: Despite his small and seemingly frail stature, Happy has proven to possess incredible durability by surviving a city-wide explosion caused by Jackal, one of the Nine Demon Gates, despite being in the center of the explosion when it occurred.[15]\n\nFormer Magic and Abilities\n\nUshi no Koku Mairi (\xe4\xb8\x91\xe3\x81\xae\xe5\x88\xbb\xe5\x8f\x82\xe3\x82\x8a Ushi no Koku Mairi): During their fight against Kain, he catches the Mr. Cursey doll Natsu threw to him. While flying he used it, while it had Lucy\'s hair, delivered an attack on him.[16]\n\nSecret Attack: Lucy Fire (\xe5\xbf\x85\xe6\xae\xba\xe3\x83\xbb\xe3\x83\xab\xe3\x83\xbc\xe3\x82\xb7\xe3\x82\xa3\xe3\x83\x95\xe3\x82\xa1\xe3\x82\xa4\xe3\x82\xa2 Hissatsu: R\xc5\xabshi Faia): While he was controlling Mr. Cursey and after Natsu had ignited Lucy, Happy used Max Speed to make Lucy\'s whole body catch on fire, and had her deliver a brutal kick to Kain Hikaru.[16]\n\nFire Magic (\xe7\x81\xab\xe3\x81\xae\xe9\xad\x94\xe6\xb3\x95 Hi no Mah\xc5\x8d): After consuming a strange fruit, Happy turned red (calling himself "Red Happy") and gained the ability to breathe fire. It faded after one usage, but returned once more during the visit to Toma E. Fiore, only to disappear again after a sudden release of fire.[17]\n\nCatmander\'s Roar (\xe3\x83\x8d\xe3\x82\xb3\xe3\x83\x9e\xe3\x83\xb3\xe3\x83\x80\xe3\x83\xbc\xe3\x81\xae\xe5\x92\x86\xe5\x93\xae Nekomand\xc4\x81 no H\xc5\x8dk\xc5\x8d):[18] Happy releases a blast of Fire Magic from his mouth, it was potent enough to knock out Red Knife.[17]\n\nYokai Form: While under the effects of Youko\'s Hyakki Yagy\xc5\x8d, Happy is transformed into a Yokai called Suiko. While in this form, Happy\'s appearance changes into a large quadruped tiger while also carrying his enlarged backpack.[19]\n\nSpirit Power (\xe9\x9c\x8a\xe5\x8a\x9b Reiryoku ): While in this form, Happy gains access to this spiritual power while also being enhanced several times by Youko. [20]\n\n(\xe9\x9c\x8a\xe5\x8a\x9b ): While in this form, Happy gains access to this spiritual power while also being enhanced several times by Youko. Ice Resistance: While in this form, Happy is able to resist being frozen by Gray\'s Magic.[21]\n\nEquipment\n\nBackpack: A small green backpack that Happy uses to carry snacks.[22]\n\nFish (or other food products): Happy is constantly seen using fish or fruits in battle. He uses them as blunt weapons, and also as swords. His range of "weapons" varies from fish to octopi to crabs.[23]\n\nTrivia\n\nHappy\'s likes include fish. His dislikes include dogs, although he\'s fine with Plue. [2]\n\nHiro Mashima was originally going to name Happy "Freyr" after the Norse god but didn\'t think it would suit his character. [24]\n\nFrom the Volume 16 Limited Edition: Sorcerer Interview, the best quality of Fairy Tail according to Happy was that "Fairy Tail made the best fish entrees"! He wants to see Igneel in the future. Has a good relationship with Natsu and Lucy. The hardest job Happy ever took was fishing for the Winged Fishes, which tasted horrible.[25]\n\nQuotes\n\n(To Lucy about Erza\'s Magic) "Erza\'s Magic is beautiful. Plenty of blood came out in the end. Her opponent\'s blood." [26]\n\n(To Nichiya and Nadi) "We\'re not your puppets!! We are... Mages of Fairy Tail!!!" [27]\n\n(To Byro Cracy) "What kind of rightful cause makes people sad and suffer?! In Edolas, we saw a lot of people suffering and Exceeds going through hardships! A path that forces you to cause people pain and sacrifice them along the way is one that\'ll eventually fall to pieces and disappear! Is that the way you want everyone to go?! Even a fish is free to swim whenever it wants in the water, right?! Well, we\'re the same! We take requests from people who are in trouble and help them, so they can be happy and we get a reward. That\'s how we\'ve been operating all along. That\'s what a guild does! Against you and that fake righteousness you hold over your head, Fairy Tail isn\'t gonna be beat!" [28]\n\n(To Future Lucy) "Sure I\'m sad!!!! I don\'t care what world you come from... I don\'t care what anybody says, you\'re Lucy!! You\'re Lucy!!! You\'re my friend!!!! Any friend would be sad about that!!!!" [29]\n\nBattles & Events\n\nReferences'
