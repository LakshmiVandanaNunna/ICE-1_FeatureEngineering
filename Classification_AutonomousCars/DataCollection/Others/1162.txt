Look! The remnants of Hurricane Ida caused flash flooding and a number of deaths and disrupted transit across parts of New York and New Jersey. Credit Credit... Gregg Vigliotti for The New York Times The death toll from the remnants of Hurricane Ida grew on Friday with the announcement of two more deaths in New Jersey, bringing the total number of lives lost to 46 across four states hit that were hit by the storm Wednesday evening. Authorities fear the toll will increase further: Gov. Phillip D. Murphy of New Jersey said at least six people were still missing in the floods. \xe2\x80\x9cThis was a deadly and dangerous storm, and we continue to face its aftereffects,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at a morning news conference. The dead include 25 people in New Jersey, 16 in New York, four in Pennsylvania and one in Connecticut. In New York City, where 13 people died, most of whom were trapped in flooded basement apartments, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Friday that going forward, when flash floods were forecast, the city would go door-to-door in neighborhoods with high concentrations of such apartments and evacuate residents. New Jersey officials released a county-by-county breakdown of deaths. They were concentrated in a belt across the upper middle region of the state, with most occurring in Hunterdon County (6 deaths), Union County (5), Essex County (4) and Somerset County (4).

The aid will be distributed in grants of $1,000 to $5,000. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99ve been crushed and you can prove it, you\xe2\x80\x99re eligible,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Murphy said. Mr. Murphy and Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York both said that they were expecting large infusions of recovery aid from the federal government once a federal disaster has been declared, something that President Biden is expected to do after his declaration Thursday night of federal emergency status for New York and New Jersey. Ms. Hochul said the state would easily surpass the $30 million threshold required for the federal government to eventually issue a so-called major disaster declaration, which would loosen a wider range of federal assistance for individuals and infrastructure projects. Locations of Deaths Caused by the Storm More than 40 people were killed by the heavy rains and flooding in the New York region on Wednesday and Thursday. This map shows where deaths are known to have occurred. There are no figures yet on the extent of property damage caused by the storm, which dumped half a foot of water in just a few hours across parts of the region, but many hundreds of homes, at least, were damaged. The Red Cross said it housed nearly 400 people in temporary shelters in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and New York Thursday night. On Friday, New York City\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Education said that 234 of its roughly 1,600 public school buildings were affected by the storm, mostly by basement flooding, but that all the buildings will reopen when school starts Sept. 13. As of Friday afternoon, more than 30,000 homes in the region were still without power, including 20,000 in Pennsylvania and more than 7,000 each in New Jersey and New York. The status of mass transit in the region remains spotty. Most New York City subway lines are running regular service. But on commuter rails, all service of Metro-North Railroad is either suspended or limited, and three New Jersey Transit lines \xe2\x80\x94 the Gladstone, Pascack Valley and Raritan Valley \xe2\x80\x94 remain shut down. Long Island Rail Road service is back to normal. Andy Newman, Luis Ferr\xc3\xa9-Sadurn\xc3\xad, Tracey Tully, Jonah E.

Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:44 - 0:00 transcript New York\xe2\x80\x99s Mayor Outlines Rain-Preparedness Plan Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York announced new measures for rain emergencies, driven by climate change, including issuing weather-related travel bans and quickly evacuating people in basement apartments and other areas at high risk for flooding. Today, I\xe2\x80\x99m announcing the N.Y.C. Climate Driven Rain Response. We have to handle this differently because we\xe2\x80\x99ve now been shown an entirely different situation. It is climate driven and that\xe2\x80\x99s crucial to put upfront. Because it\xe2\x80\x99s not like the rain we used to know. It\xe2\x80\x99s just not. It\xe2\x80\x99s a different reality of speed and intensity that we now have to understand will be normal. Wednesday evening was the first time the National Weather Service in history, determined that there needed to be a flash flood emergency in New York City. Not the normal warnings we get, but on the Wednesday night, they said this is an entirely different thing. We need to answer that with the use of travel bans. Now, a travel ban is not something to do lightly. We\xe2\x80\x99ve only done it a few times previously, particularly during massive snowstorms, blizzards. But unfortunately, what we learned on Wednesday night is a travel ban is the kind of tool we may need to use much more frequently, which would mean, for example, that that same morning or that day before, telling people there is a chance that a travel ban will be activated. And once it\xe2\x80\x99s activated, people will have to leave the streets, get out of subways, et cetera, immediately. For folks in basement apartments and in some other areas of the city as well, if we are seeing this kind of rain, we have to have an evacuation mechanism that can reach them. And again, this is a very forceful measure. It\xe2\x80\x99s not just saying to people, you have to get out of your apartment. It\xe2\x80\x99s going door to door with our first responders, and other city agencies to get people out. Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York announced new measures for rain emergencies, driven by climate change, including issuing weather-related travel bans and quickly evacuating people in basement apartments and other areas at high risk for flooding. Credit Credit... Spencer Platt/Getty Images In the wake of the deaths of 13 people in New York City from this week\xe2\x80\x99s flooding, most of them in basement apartments, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Friday that the city would increase the use of evacuation orders and travel bans, issue stronger flood warnings to those living in basement apartments and send emergency responders door-to-door to help evacuate residents. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have to change everything,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. de Blasio said of the effort he called \xe2\x80\x9cClimate-Driven Rain Response,\xe2\x80\x9d which was immediately criticized by advocates and officials. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not like the rain we used to know,\xe2\x80\x9d the mayor added. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a different reality, a speed and intensity that we now have to understand will be normal.\xe2\x80\x9d The city recorded its heaviest one-hour rainfall ever on Wednesday, 3.15 inches, breaking a record set only days earlier by Tropical Storm Henri. Mr. de Blasio said that the city will now issue travel bans more quickly. And instead of using evacuation to remove people from coastal areas, the city will now move to evacuate people in basement apartments and other areas that face flooding from heavy rain. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a very forceful measure. It\xe2\x80\x99s not just saying to people you have to get out of your apartment, it\xe2\x80\x99s going door-to-door with our first responders and other city agencies to get people out,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. de Blasio said. The city will target special phone alerts to neighborhoods, particularly in Queens, with heavy concentrations of basement apartments. The apartments are collectively home to tens of thousands of New Yorkers, largely immigrants, and are mostly illegally converted and subdivided units. In spite of warnings from the National Weather Service that New York City would see heavy rain and flash floods, Mr. de Blasio said the intensity of Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s rainfall was unprecedented and caught city officials off guard. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got to literally change the whole way of thinking because as good as some of the projections are, they can\xe2\x80\x99t always keep up with weather that changes this rapidly and this radically,\xe2\x80\x9d he said on MSNBC. But the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s plan was immediately panned by housing advocates and officials who said it left tenants who were caught at the intersection of the affordable housing crisis and the climate crisis just as vulnerable as before the floods. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a bizarre plan because you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about evacuating tenants who you don't know where they live,\xe2\x80\x9d said Annetta Seecharran, the executive director of the Chhaya Community Development Corporation, which works on housing issues for low-income South Asian and Indo-Caribbean New Yorkers. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s rather neglectful to not address the root cause of the problem, which is how do we ensure people living in these apartments are safe? City Councilman Brad Lander, the Democratic nominee for city comptroller, said the city should provide basic safety improvements for basement apartments such as smoke detectors and then relaunch a defunded pilot program to convert illegal basement apartments. \xe2\x80\x9cIt sounds like the mayor is saying let\xe2\x80\x99s leave people in unregulated, illegal, unsafe basement units at large scale but hope they check their Notify N.Y.C. Twitter alerts, which does not sound like a good way to keep people safe\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Eric Adams, the Democratic nominee for mayor, favors legalizing basement apartments and has criticized the decision to defund the pilot. Letitia James, the state attorney general, said the mayor should provide emergency housing vouchers for all residents of unregulated basement apartments. \xe2\x80\x9cExtreme rainfall and other severe weather events are now the rule, not the exception, in New York,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a statement. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the face of that risk, it is our duty to move these New Yorkers out of harm\xe2\x80\x99s way by offering them safer, regulated housing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGov. Hochul: \xe2\x80\x98We have to take action\xe2\x80\x99 to avert future disasters. Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York spoke about the state\xe2\x80\x99s death toll on Friday: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s hard to even read those numbers, because those numbers are people.\xe2\x80\x9d Credit... Stephanie Keith for The New York Times New York State officials were in the preliminary phases of assessing Ida\xe2\x80\x99s damage on Friday, a day after President Biden approved an emergency declaration that will open up additional federal resources, including $5 million for affected counties. Even so, state leaders said they would need additional federal assistance to fully recover from Ida\xe2\x80\x99s torrential rains, which inundated the region and killed at least 16 people in New York, where more than 7,000 people were still without electricity. Gov. Kathy Hochul said on Friday the state would easily surpass the $30 million threshold required to request a so-called major disaster declaration, which would loosen a wider range of federal aid for individuals and infrastructure projects. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t ever want again to see Niagara Falls rushing down the stairs of one of the New York City subways,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Hochul said during a morning briefing in Westchester County. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t prevent it right now, but I know we have to take action to mitigate that.\xe2\x80\x9d Power had been restored to more than 80,000 customers, but more than 6,400 households in Westchester County alone still lacked electricity. About a dozen roads, from the Bronx to Rockland County, were fully or partially closed. And the Metro-North Railroad system had sustained severe damage and \xe2\x80\x9cwas not in good shape right now,\xe2\x80\x9d stressing that repairing it was \xe2\x80\x9cnot going to happen very quickly.\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Hochul said officials from the Department of Financial Services would fan out to help homeowners and businesses file insurance claims to receive reimbursements for damages, urging property owners to keep \xe2\x80\x9cgood records.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHomeowners, keep track of everything you have to spend to get your houses cleaned up and restored as best you can and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll take it from there,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. Questions have already emerged over whether city and state officials were adequately prepared for the storm. While the state deployed emergency resources before the storm, for example, Ms. Hochul did not declare a state of emergency until early Thursday, when the brunt of Ida\xe2\x80\x99s rains had already inundated roads and train tracks. \xe2\x80\x9cWe did not know that we\xe2\x80\x99d be in the same vulnerable situation with loss of life and property destruction,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, referring to the damage from Ida just days earlier in Louisiana and Mississippi. Ms. Hochul stressed that the staggering amount of rainfall that drenched the state in such a short window of time caught officials and meteorologists off guard on Wednesday night. \xe2\x80\x9cI think the meteorologists are surprised,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, adding that \xe2\x80\x9cMother Nature does what she wants.\xe2\x80\x9d She said that people were properly warned about the flash floods via text, but that perhaps the warnings should have been translated into more languages or had failed to reach the \xe2\x80\x9cvulnerable population\xe2\x80\x9d living in basement apartments where many died. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have to get a better system for evacuations and deploy people on the ground in these events and not hope that they got a message,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Hochul said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not even sure they own a cellphone.\xe2\x80\x9d Even so, she openly questioned whether the state could have done more to alert New Yorkers or to evacuate the subway system before stations began to flood. She promised to convene a task force to tackle such questions and put together an after-action report to determine if there were any \xe2\x80\x9cmissed opportunities.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI want to know exactly what we did right,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Hochul said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf there\xe2\x80\x99s any areas that were shortcomings, I want to know what they are and how we address them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMost of the apartments where New Yorkers drowned were illegal residences. The city says that most of the apartments where people drowned in Queens were illegal conversions, including the one in this house in Jamaica. Credit... Gregg Vigliotti for The New York Times New York City\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Buildings said Friday that five of the six houses in which New Yorkers were killed by Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s flood were illegally converted cellar or basement apartments. Of the 13 people found dead in the city from the storm, at least 11 were in basement units, which have long made up a significant part of New York City\xe2\x80\x99s vast housing stock, a network of rentals that often lack basic safety features like more than one way to get in or out. The department said that four of the five basement apartments where people were killed in Queens were illegal conversions, as was one on Ridgewood Avenue in Brooklyn, where another person died. Another basement apartment, on Grand Central Parkway in Queens, was a legal dwelling, the department said. It is illegal to alter an existing building to create additional apartment units without obtaining official approval, and such apartments are often considered unsafe by authorities, given their shoddy construction, poorly installed gas and electrical systems and light and ventilation issues. Still, the apartments remain in demand, in part because they are often far cheaper than most rentals. The buildings department has received reports of over 1,100 properties across the city that were damaged by the storm, and its inspectors are conducting safety checks at each location. \xe2\x80\x9cOur team is tirelessly conducting inspections at over a thousand properties across the five boroughs in the aftermath of Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s storm,\xe2\x80\x9d said the department\xe2\x80\x99s commissioner, Melanie E. La Rocca. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll continue doing everything we can to keep New Yorkers safe in their residences.\xe2\x80\x9d Climate change has made low-lying homes increasingly treacherous, because of the likelihood of deadly flooding as a wall of water blocks what is often the only means of escape. Last year, the department received 11,781 complaints related to units believed to be illegal conversions, down from 16,776 in 2019. So far this year it has received 8,072 such complaints. In about half of the cases since 2011, inspectors closed the complaints because they could not gain access to the dwelling, a New York Times analysis of buildings department data shows.

Then a dramatic rescue. Essence Crockett was wrapping up a visit to her mother, who has advanced Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s disease, when she heard her mother\xe2\x80\x99s home health aide scream from the other side of the garden apartment in Forest Hills, Queens. \xe2\x80\x9cShe started yelling from the next room, \xe2\x80\x98Come, come! There\xe2\x80\x99s water coming in!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Crockett said. \xe2\x80\x9cI ran out into the living room and water was just forcing its way through her front apartment door and also her second garden door.\xe2\x80\x9d The two women \xe2\x80\x94 Ms. Crockett and the aide, Obianuju Okoro \xe2\x80\x94 began to frantically grab chairs and other items they thought might block the gushing water. But it would not stop pouring in. Image Claire Adams, 88, who cannot walk, was trapped in rising water that reached her neck before help came in through a window. Credit... Essence Crockett Ms. Crockett\xe2\x80\x99s mother, Claire Adams, 88, can no longer walk, so the women ran to her room and began the laborious process of transferring her from her hospital bed to her wheelchair using a hydraulic lift. By the time they wheeled Ms. Adams into the living room, the force of the water had sealed both doors firmly shut. Water rose to their ankles, and then their knees. They were trapped. Panic set in. Ms. Adams, whom her daughter described as \xe2\x80\x9cagitated\xe2\x80\x9d even on a good day, began to scream, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m cold! I\xe2\x80\x99m wet!\xe2\x80\x9d as the water rose around her in her wheelchair. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was no way to explain what was happening to her,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Crockett, 60, said. As the water rose, she and Ms. Okoro began to lose hope. Looking at the windows, they realized they could push the air-conditioners out and perhaps scramble to safety. But they could not take Ms. Adams with them. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought this is the end,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Crockett said through tears on Friday. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense for us to all perish. I thought my mother\xe2\x80\x99s aide should not sacrifice her life. And then I turned and said goodbye to my mother.\xe2\x80\x9d As they climbed, Ms. Crockett said, Ms. Okoro wept and kept saying, \xe2\x80\x9cYour mother, your mother!\xe2\x80\x9d When they got onto the street in front of the building, they were greeted by the panicked screams of their neighbors. Eight other garden apartments in the building were also being flooded. The lobby had filled with several feet of murky water, and the pressure of the rushing water had made its doors difficult to open. They tried to call 911, Ms. Okoro said, but the call would not connect. So she ran into the building to get help, wading through several feet of cold, leaf-strewn water in the lobby and climbing the stairs to the second floor to bang on the doors of Ms. Adams\xe2\x80\x99s neighbors. Most of them were too afraid to go into the water. But soon she found a longtime neighbor of Ms. Adams, Michael Lettieri, who agreed to swim back through the lobby with her and followed her outside. \xe2\x80\x9cThe whole lobby was flooded,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Lettieri said. \xe2\x80\x9cI never thought I\xe2\x80\x99d see a thing like that in my life \xe2\x80\x94 it was like a white water river coming in through the door.\xe2\x80\x9d When he heard that Ms. Adams was trapped in her apartment, Mr. Lettieri climbed through the same window that Ms. Crockett and Ms. Okoro had fled through. Ms. Okoro and another man soon followed him. They found Ms. Adams in her wheelchair with water up to her neck, but were able to lift her back onto her bed, they said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was just her head that was out of the water,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Okoro said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was screaming, \xe2\x80\x98I am cold!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Image Credit... Essence Crockett The rising floodwaters had lifted the mattress off the hospital bed\xe2\x80\x99s metal frame, and Ms. Adams was able to float on it like a raft. Mr. Lettieri stood there with her as water rose to his chest, making sure she stayed safely onboard, Ms. Crockett said. With Ms. Adams bobbing on the water in her flooded apartment, Ms. Okoro said she climbed back out the window and, with Ms. Crockett, flagged down a passing police car. Two officers came with them and broke down the apartment\xe2\x80\x99s garden door so Ms. Adams could be taken to Forest Hills Hospital, where she was resting on Friday. Her home of 43 years has been \xe2\x80\x9cdestroyed,\xe2\x80\x9d her daughter said. But they hope to rebuild. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are here; mother is still here,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Crockett said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis was a miracle. And I will forever be grateful for our neighbors and my mother\xe2\x80\x99s aide, who was an absolute champion.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAfter delivery workers braved the storm, advocates call for better conditions. On Wednesday night, many couriers barely made enough money to justify the hours spent toiling in the floods, one advocate said. Credit... David Dee Delgado/Getty Images When Mayor Bill de Blasio urged New Yorkers to stay home and take shelter from the downpour and flooding Wednesday night, one group of people continued to go out: food delivery workers, many of whom were motivated by incentives from delivery apps. After a video of a courier walking his bike through murky waist-deep water to deliver a customer\xe2\x80\x99s food sparked outrage, advocates for workers\xe2\x80\x99 rights called on the city and delivery apps to increase minimum wages and strengthen safety protections. \xe2\x80\x9cThe mayor is saying, \xe2\x80\x98Go home.\xe2\x80\x99 But the apps are giving economic incentives to the workers. \xe2\x80\x98No, stay out, stay out,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Hildalyn Col\xc3\xb3n, director of policy for Los Deliveristas Unidos, a food delivery workers\xe2\x80\x99 rights group in the city. Food delivery companies offer extra money when demand is high or during inclement weather, leading some couriers to risk their safety for the promise of potentially higher wages. Summer is also slow season in the delivery business, so many workers jump at the chance to earn more even in dangerous conditions. But on Wednesday night, many couriers barely made enough money to justify the hours spent toiling in the floods, said Ligia Guallpa, executive director of Workers Justice Project. Some Grubhub workers told her they made as little as $2 extra per delivery, she said. For the delivery service Relay, which enables restaurants to have food delivered through any delivery app, workers must complete at least 90 percent of their scheduled deliveries in order to be paid at all, Ms. Col\xc3\xb3n said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s why you see these workers in the middle of the moving water holding a bag, trying to hold it together,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Col\xc3\xb3n said. A Relay representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Workers fear retaliation from the companies if they chose to turn down deliveries or sign off the app to go home, Ms. Guallpa said. Without the legal protections of full-time employment, there is little to keep them from getting lower ratings or getting deactivated by the apps if they decline deliveries, she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWorkers were surprised to see companies were not providing incentives to go home, and there was no communication that no retaliation would happen if they opt not to take those deliveries,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Guallpa said. A DoorDash spokeswoman, Campbell Millum, said in a statement that while some workers may have been offered incentive bonuses Wednesday night, the company now regrets having pressured them to keep working. \xe2\x80\x9cAlthough we were able to pause delivery in some parts of the city as the flash flooding occurred, we should have acted more quickly and comprehensively to suspend ordering, turn off incentives to get Dashers on the roads, and communicate with all of our stakeholders,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, adding that the company was \xe2\x80\x9cputting in place controls to do better going forward.\xe2\x80\x9d A Grubhub spokesman said driver pay per order increased by a \xe2\x80\x9cdouble digit percentage\xe2\x80\x9d Wednesday night, and that drivers would not be penalized for turning orders down. Deliveries were also paused in parts of New York Wednesday night, he said, though he would not give details. Adding to the challenges delivery workers faced were equipment failures. One worker who lives in the Bronx had to spend all the money he earned that night fixing water damage to his electric scooter, Ms. Guallpa said. Los Deliveristas and the Workers Justice Project hope to push a legislative package of worker protections through the City Council later this year. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople asked, \xe2\x80\x98Why did they risk their life?\xe2\x80\x99 This is the way they make their living,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Col\xc3\xb3n said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen they offer you $2, for them, it\xe2\x80\x99s like a lifeline.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s what to do if your home flooded during Ida. People cleaned up from the flooding in Flushing, Queens, on Thursday. Credit... Benjamin Norman for The New York Times The remnants of Hurricane Ida and resulting flood on Wednesday dealt a blow to the greater New York region \xe2\x80\x94 claiming at least 46 lives, damaging property and rendering homes uninhabitable. Here are answers to five frequently asked questions on home cleanup and more. How can I determine whether my home is safe to enter after a flood? According to the C.D.C.\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cRe-entering your Flooded Home\xe2\x80\x9d guide, you should have an electrician assess your home before re-entering. If you are set on re-entering, try to do it during the day to avoid the need for electricity, and do so carefully, as homes may have suffered structural damage. Ganesh Lallbachan, the owner of G&R Electrical Contractors in Queens, said that people should be particularly cautious if water reached the level of an electrical outlet. He advised the use of long rubber boots. If you smell natural or propane gas or hear a hissing noise, leave immediately and call the fire department. Before you begin the cleaning process, you should take photos to keep for your records, for insurance and in the event that you need to present your landlord with proof of damage. What possessions can I keep and what must I dispose of? \xe2\x80\x9cWhen in doubt, throw it out!\xe2\x80\x9d said Katie Wilkes, a spokeswoman for the American Red Cross. She added that items that absorb water and cannot be cleaned or disinfected included mattresses, carpeting, cosmetics, stuffed animals and baby toys. Get rid of all food that has come in contact with flood water, including canned goods. Don\xe2\x80\x99t use water that could have been contaminated to cook, wash dishes or brush your teeth. Mold is a major concern after a flood or hurricane, particularly for people with respiratory problems.

The C.D.C. also offers a guide on tools, cleaning agents and gear necessary for safely tackling cleanup after a flood or other disaster. My home is uninhabitable \xe2\x80\x94 where can I stay? \xe2\x80\x9cThe onus falls on the landlord,\xe2\x80\x9d said Manuel Belliard, an aide in City Councilman Mark Levine\xe2\x80\x99s office. If landlords with the ability to do so refuse to put their tenants up in a hotel or apartment, renters can seek out legal assistance from the New York Legal Assistance Group, Legal Aid or the Bar Association. Is my landlord responsible for reimbursing me for the cost of my damaged possessions? No. Your landlord is responsible for structural repairs, addressing issues with your roof, floors and walls. The cost of personal items like electronics and clothing fall to you. Going forward, consider renter\xe2\x80\x99s insurance and make sure it covers flood and water damage. I\xe2\x80\x99m rattled and traumatized by my experience \xe2\x80\x94 does New York City offer mental health services?

An underpass along Queens Boulevard on Thursday. Credit... Dakota Santiago for The New York Times New York State officials, bracing for a rush of insurance claims after record-breaking rain submerged large parts of New York City, are urging insurance companies to expedite storm-related claims. The message on Thursday from the New York State Department of Financial Services, which regulates insurance companies, came as the damage from flooding from the remnants of Hurricane Ida was still coming into focus. \xe2\x80\x9cIn this emergency situation, DFS expects all insurers to do their part,\xe2\x80\x9d the department said in a statement. It is \xe2\x80\x9cimperative\xe2\x80\x9d that insurance companies come to a \xe2\x80\x9cspeedy resolution of claims.\xe2\x80\x9d The Department of Financial Services also said it would increase the number of people who could process claims by accelerating its process of approving independent insurance adjusters from outside the state to work in New York. When Hurricane Sandy pounded the New York area in October 2012, approximately 300 homes were destroyed, and more than 20,000 homes were damaged, according to city officials. North of the city, in Westchester County, the Red Cross opened a shelter in Mamaroneck High School for people whose homes were destroyed or heavily damaged in the storm. It served 125 people on Thursday night and the shelter remains open, the organization said. The damage from the storm underscored how vulnerable major parts of New York City\xe2\x80\x99s infrastructure are to extreme weather. For more information, New York City residents can type their address into this website and see whether their home is in an area at risk of flooding. The site, FloodHelpNY.org, was created by the nonprofit Center for New York City Neighborhoods, which receives funding from the city and state of New York.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNew Yorkers tried to save neighbors from Ida\xe2\x80\x99s floods. Sometimes they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. Roxanna Florentino looked at the damage in the basement of the building where she lives in Brooklyn on Thursday. Her neighbor, Roberto Bravo, died there on Wednesday night as surging waters poured in. Credit... Anna Watts for The New York Times The torrents from Ida\xe2\x80\x99s waters cascaded through New York City basement doors and windows, turning everyday spaces into death traps. In Woodside, Queens, Deborah Torres said she heard the desperate pleas from the basement of three members of a family, including a toddler. As the water rushed into the building around 10 p.m. on Wednesday, Ms. Torres said she heard the family frantically call out to another neighbor, Choi Sledge. Ms. Sledge pleaded with the family to flee. Within moments, however, the cascade of water was too powerful, and it also kept anyone from trying to get downstairs to help. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was impossible,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ms. Torres, who lives on the first floor. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was like a pool.\xe2\x80\x9d The family did not survive. Darlene Lee, 48, was in a basement apartment that belonged to the super of a condominium in Central Parkway, Queens. Flooding burst through a glass sliding door in the apartment, and quickly filled it with about six feet of murky water. The water pinned Ms. Lee between the apartment\xe2\x80\x99s steel front door and the door frame, leaving her wedged and unable to escape. Patricia Fuentes, the property manager, had just gotten off work when she heard Ms. Lee screaming for help and found her stuck. Ms. Fuentes ran to the lobby to call for aid, and Jayson Jordan, the assistant super, and Andy Tapia, a handyman, jumped through the broken glass door to get to Ms. Lee. But they could not save her. Ms. Lee was pinned and Mr. Tapia tried to help her keep her above the chin-deep water. Eventually, the men were able to pry her from the door, but it was too late, Mr. Jordan said. Ms. Lee was killed by the storm. In Cypress Hills, Brooklyn, Ricardo Garcia was awakened by a surge of water that he said exploded through the door of his shared basement apartment at about 10:15 p.m. In moments, it was up to his knees, then his waist, then his chest. Mr. Garcia, 50, banged on the door next to his, waking another roommate, Oliver De La Cruz, who was shaking on Thursday morning as he looked at the water stains that reached to the ceiling of his ruined room.

Anna Watts for The New York Times \xe2\x80\x9cI almost died inside here, I almost died, man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. De La Cruz, 22. Mr. De La Cruz broke down his bedroom door to escape in his boxer shorts. Mr. Garcia said that he and Mr. De La Cruz climbed to the first floor, struggling against the water pouring down the stairs. Mr. De La Cruz found his upstairs neighbor, Roxanna Florentino, who has lived in the building for 18 years. She said she heard another man, 66-year-old Roberto Bravo, crying out for help from a back bedroom in the basement apartment. Image Roberto Bravo Credit... via Pablo Bravo Ms. Florentino said Mr. Bravo was pleading for help in Spanish, and neighbors were trying to reach him. But water was pouring through both the front door and a window. She realized Mr. Bravo\xe2\x80\x99s screaming had stopped. On Thursday, it was clear that the water had risen so forcefully where Mr. Bravo had been that it tore off the door and broke though the ceiling, leaving dank decay. The Ecuadorean flag hanging on his wall was soaked and muddied, the floor below strewn with debris, along with a water-stained photo of Mr. Bravo in a tuxedo at a formal event.

They brought out Mr. Bravo\xe2\x80\x99s body. She tried to sleep but each time she drifted off, she heard Mr. Bravo\xe2\x80\x99s voice, calling a last time. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so hard when someone asks for help and you can\xe2\x80\x99t help them,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.

At the Atlantic Avenue-Barclays Center subway station in Brooklyn on Thursday. Service on the system was gradually improving by Friday morning.\n\nCredit... Earl Wilson/The New York Times Two days after the remnants of Hurricane Ida brought torrential flooding and deadly downpours to New York, much of the region\xe2\x80\x99s transit system was back up and running Friday evening. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority conducted round-the-clock repairs to get the nation\xe2\x80\x99s largest subway system fully running again after the storm damaged tracks and turned platforms and stairwells into water slides. A majority of subway lines were back in service Friday with few delays and partial suspensions. (Check the latest service updates here.) \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve managed to restore a ton of service today but our tracks in Queens suffered the most damage,\xe2\x80\x9d the M.T.A. said on Twitter on Thursday night, urging those traveling in Queens to consider taking the Long Island Railroad instead. The Long Island Railroad will provide free rides between several Queens stations for those who show conductors their MetroCards or OMNY app. Our teams worked tirelessly throughout the night to restore subway service on almost all lines (the 6 remains partially suspended).\n\n\n\nWhile trains can run everywhere, service may not be frequent. Some lines have *extremely* limited service. In Queens, consider LIRR if possible. \xe2\x80\x94 NYCT Subway. Wear a Mask. (@NYCTSubway) September 3, 2021 Amtrak said it would resume service along the Northeast Corridor, between Washington and Boston, on Friday, but it said trains between Albany and New York City would remain canceled. New Jersey Transit said all train lines except Pascack Valley and Raritan Valley would resume operations as usual. The Newark Light Rail also reopened Friday evening after a small sinkhole that opened up on the tracks from the storm was repaired. The Long Island Rail Road resumed full service by Friday and will return to its usual weekend schedule Saturday. On the Metro-North Railroad, train service resumed Friday for the New Haven Line and the Harlem Line after workers cleared more than 10 inches of water and debris from several stations. Both lines will run enhanced weekend service as the Hudson Line, which suffered the most damage, remained suspended. \xe2\x80\x9cOur crews have made extraordinary progress over the last 24 hours in extremely difficult conditions,\xe2\x80\x9d Catherine Rinaldi, president of Metro-North, said in a statement Thursday night. \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot thank our crew members enough for the heroic work they have been doing and will continue to do.\xe2\x80\x9d On Twitter, the M.T.A. praised \xe2\x80\x9chero bus operators\xe2\x80\x9d for keeping the city moving during Wednesday night\xe2\x80\x99s floods and the days that followed. \xe2\x80\x9cAs we head into Labor Day weekend, we\xe2\x80\x99re thankful for the tens of thousands of essential workers across the tri-state who have been working nonstop to put the region back together,\xe2\x80\x9d the M.T.A. said on Twitter Friday. Flights on Friday morning out of La Guardia Airport, Kennedy International Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport largely appeared to be on time with minimal delays. In response to questions during a news conference Friday on how the M.T.A. could strengthen its system against future storms, Mayor Bill de Blasio called for the state to move quickly to implement congestion pricing. Mr. de Blasio also pointed to federal stimulus money included in President Biden\xe2\x80\x99s proposed infrastructure bill, part of which the city would use to strengthen its public transit. \xe2\x80\x9cWe need resources on a vast scale to fix the M.T.A.,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. de Blasio said. \xe2\x80\x9cCongestion pricing will bring us the regular revenue to constantly make improvements.\xe2\x80\x9d Derrick Bryson Taylor and\n\nWhat went wrong? Despite Ida warnings, New York officials couldn\xe2\x80\x99t prevent death and destruction. The authorities responding to a basement apartment in Queens on Thursday, where flooding killed three people. Credit... Gregg Vigliotti for The New York Times The warnings and maps seemed clear. On Tuesday evening, the National Weather Service issued a prediction that a wide swath of the Ohio Valley and the Eastern Seaboard would soon see heavy rainfall from what had once been Hurricane Ida. And one of the reddest portions of those maps \xe2\x80\x94 indicating severe rainfall and a high probability of flooding \xe2\x80\x94 hovered directly over New York City. Those predictions proved true. But the record intensity of the rain, with more than three inches falling in one hour, caught officials by surprise. And on Thursday, as the death toll in the Northeast increased, questions quickly arose as to whether city and state officials were caught flat-footed by the storm\xe2\x80\x99s ferocity. The destruction in the New York region seemed especially striking considering that Ida had already blown through the Gulf Coast, hitting New Orleans on Sunday with far stronger winds but with fewer deaths. It also came in the wake of a series of ever-more-powerful tropical storms \xe2\x80\x94 including 2012\xe2\x80\x99s Hurricane Sandy \xe2\x80\x94 which have been repeatedly cited as warning signs that the city\xe2\x80\x99s aging infrastructure and subways are vulnerable to the violent weather caused by climate change. The subways, in particular, have come to act as a default sewer whenever heavy rains overwhelm the city\xe2\x80\x99s actual sewer system. The storm\xe2\x80\x99s devastation underscored the city\xe2\x80\x99s increasing fragility in the age of global warming, but also illustrated how the unpredictability of weather events can topple even the best laid of plans.
