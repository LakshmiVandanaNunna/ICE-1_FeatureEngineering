b"Saturday's rain will push out before Labor Day.\n\nINDIANAPOLIS \xe2\x80\x94 We're starting our holiday weekend with some spotty showers ahead of our next weather system.\n\nThis will bring more widespread rain mainly after lunchtime Saturday and last through the evening. A few isolated storms are possible, so keep an eye to the sky for any outdoor activities you may have planned. The clouds and rain will hinder temperatures with highs struggling to reach the mid 70s.\n\nRain will depart from north to south with showers continuing mainly south of I-70 through the overnight. Pack the rain gear if you're tailgating ahead of the Purdue vs. Oregon State game at Ross-Ade Stadium. Showers will be in the area at kickoff at 7 p.m. but taper off toward the end of the game.\n\nWe expect big-time improvements by Sunday. Rain will push out but clouds will linger in the morning. Temperatures start off in the mid 60s.\n\nThe sky clears after lunchtime and the sun returns for Sunday afternoon. Seasonal high temperatures climb to near 80."
