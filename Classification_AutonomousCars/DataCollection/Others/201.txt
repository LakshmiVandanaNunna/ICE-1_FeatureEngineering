b'But what effect does eating chocolate have on our health?\n\nChocolate has since become a popular food product that millions enjoy every day, thanks to its unique, rich, and sweet taste.\n\nAfter the European discovery of the Americas, chocolate became very popular in the wider world, and its demand exploded.\n\nChocolate is made from tropical Theobroma cacao tree seeds. Its earliest use dates back to the Olmec civilization in Mesoamerica.\n\nThe next time you eat a piece of chocolate, you may not have to feel so guilty about it. Despite its bad reputation for causing weight gain, a number of health benefits may be associated with this delicious treat.\n\nShare on Pinterest Recent research suggests that chocolate may have some health benefits.\n\nChocolate receives a lot of bad press because of its high fat and sugar content. Its consumption has been associated with acne, obesity, high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, and diabetes.\n\nHowever, according to a review of chocolate\xe2\x80\x99s health effects published in the Netherlands Journal of Medicine, it\xe2\x80\x99s not all bad news.\n\nThe authors point to the discovery that cocoa, the key ingredient in chocolate, contains biologically active phenolic compounds.\n\nThis has changed people\xe2\x80\x99s views on chocolate, and it has stimulated research into how it might impact aging, and conditions such as oxidative stress, blood pressure regulation, and atherosclerosis.\n\nChocolate\xe2\x80\x99s antioxidant potential may have a range of health benefits. The higher the cocoa content, as in dark chocolate, the more benefits there are. Dark chocolate may also contain less fat and sugar, but it is important to check the label.\n\nEating chocolate may have the following benefits:\n\nlowering cholesterol levels\n\npreventing cognitive decline\n\nreducing the risk of cardiovascular problems\n\nIt is important to note that the possible health benefits mentioned below came from single studies. More research is needed to confirm that eating chocolate can really improve people\xe2\x80\x99s health.\n\nIn addition, chocolate bars do not contain only cocoa. The benefits and risks of any other ingredients, such as sugar and fat, need to be considered.\n\n1) Cholesterol\n\nOne study, published in The Journal of Nutrition, suggests that chocolate consumption might help reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, also known as \xe2\x80\x9cbad cholesterol.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe researchers set out to investigate whether chocolate bars containing plant sterols (PS) and cocoa flavanols (CF) have any effect on cholesterol levels.\n\nThe authors concluded: \xe2\x80\x9cRegular consumption of chocolate bars containing PS and CF, as part of a low-fat diet, may support cardiovascular health by lowering cholesterol and improving blood pressure.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n2) Cognitive function\n\nScientists at Harvard Medical School have suggested that drinking two cups of hot chocolate a day could help keep the brain healthy and reduce memory decline in older people.\n\nThe researchers found that hot chocolate helped improve blood flow to parts of the brain where it was needed.\n\nLead author, Farzaneh A. Sorond, said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs different areas of the brain need more energy to complete their tasks, they also need greater blood flow. This relationship, called neurovascular coupling, may play an important role in diseases such as Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nResults of a lab experiment, published in 2014, indicated that a cocoa extract, called lavado, might reduce or prevent damage to nerve pathways found in patients with Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s disease. This extract could help slow symptoms such as cognitive decline.\n\nAnother study, published in 2016 in the journal Appetite, suggests eating chocolate at least once weekly could improve cognitive function.\n\n3) Heart disease\n\nResearch published in The BMJ, suggests that consuming chocolate could help lower the risk of developing heart disease by one-third .\n\nBased on their observations, the authors concluded that higher levels of chocolate consumption could be linked to a lower risk of cardiometabolic disorders.\n\nThey call for further experimental studies to confirm whether consuming chocolate is beneficial.\n\n4) Stroke\n\nCanadian scientists, in a study involving 44,489 individuals, found that people who ate one serving of chocolate were 22 percent less likely to experience a stroke than those who did not. Also, those who had about two ounces of chocolate a week were 46 percent less likely to die from a stroke.\n\nA further study, published in the journal Heart in 2015, tracked the impact of diet on the long-term health of 25,000 men and women.\n\nThe findings suggested that eating up to 100 grams (g) of chocolate each day may be linked to a lower risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\n5) Fetal growth and development\n\nEating 30 g (about one ounce) of chocolate every day during pregnancy might benefit fetal growth and development, according to a study presented at the 2016 Pregnancy Meeting of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine in Atlanta, GA.\n\n6) Athletic performance\n\nShare on Pinterest Chocolate may help athletes cover more distance while using less oxygen.\n\nFindings published in The Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition suggest that a little dark chocolate might boost oxygen availability during fitness training.\n\nResearchers who studied cyclists doing time trials in the United Kingdom found that \xe2\x80\x9cAfter eating dark chocolate, the riders used less oxygen when cycling at a moderate pace and also covered more distance in a two-minute flat-out time trial.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe scientists believe that the success of dark chocolate in this case is that it contains flavonols known as epicatechins, which enhance the release of nitric oxide in the body. Beetroot juice has a similar effect.'
