b'SAN DIEGO (CNS) \xe2\x80\x93 High pressure was predicted to build into California over the Labor Day weekend, bringing hot weather inland, the National Weather Service said.\n\nThe marine layer was expected to become shallower and less extensive, with limited clouds and fog confined mainly to coastal areas, forecasters said.\n\nA south swell was forecast to arrive at county beaches this weekend, elevating surf, and creating dangerous swimming conditions, the NWS said.\n\nHigh temperatures along the coast Saturday were predicted to be 77-82 degrees and inland 86-91 with overnight lows of 62-67. Highs in the western valleys will be 90-95 and 94-99 near the foothills with lows of 64-72. Mountain highs were expected to be 89-96 with overnight lows of 64-73. Highs in the deserts will be 105-110 with overnight lows of 81-86.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCoastal areas and the San Diego valleys should largely escape the heat, although Saturday should be the warmest day for those areas as it appears a coastal eddy may develop for Sunday, lowering temperatures a few degrees,\xe2\x80\x9d the NWS said.\n\n\xe2\x98\x80\xef\xb8\x8f Happy Saturday! With temps on the rise this weekend, many may be heading to the beaches to cool off. Elevated surf and strong rip currents will develop and impact the beaches tonight through Mon night. Use caution when swimming and make sure you swim near a lifeguard!#CAwx pic.twitter.com/AXeC2pf1DK \xe2\x80\x94 NWS San Diego (@NWSSanDiego) September 4, 2021\n\nThe high pressure was predicted to shift east into the Great Basin on Tuesday, putting Southern California into a good position to welcome monsoon moisture back into the region, forecasters said.\n\nMonsoon thunderstorms were likely to return by the middle of next week for the mountains and deserts ahead of a developing West Coast trough and cooling trend late next week.\n\nThunderstorms could return for the mountains and deserts around Wednesday and may continue through Friday.\n\nFor next weekend, a trough may develop off the West Coast, which would bring stronger onshore flow, a deeper marine layer, and cooler temperatures.\n\nHot conditions expected away from the coast this Labor Day Weekend. Sunday is forecast to be the hottest day of the weekend with highs up to 10 degrees above average in the Inland Empire.
