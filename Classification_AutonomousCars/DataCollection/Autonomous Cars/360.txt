b'Commuting time might even be dramatically reduced if different activities could be done virtually from home. Further to this, what will actually be transported in self-driving vehicles is another interesting question. With a steep expansion in ecommerce, the flow of goods in cities is suited to smaller vehicles. The traditional logistic systems will be challenged by this development, and self-driving vehicles might be used to transport goods when not transporting people. Therefore self-driving cars, to some extent, may replace trucks in order to improve parcel delivery for transport companies with a need for micro logistics around a city.\n\nIn the 2014 Ericsson ConsumerLab report, Connectivity Beyond the Screen, 67 percent of smartphone owners said they were interested in a same-day delivery service that works on any device, online and in stores. As an example of this, Amazon is gradually expanding its same-day and one-day delivery services (that initially started in the US) to many cities across the world, with Toronto in Canada being the most recent addition.13 Furthermore, Amazon has also started a rideshare-like delivery service called Amazon Flex, where drivers deliver parcels in a similar setup to companies such as Uber.14\n\nWhile autonomous vehicles may mean that those who love driving will get to do it less, there will be many other benefits to people both inside and outside the car. As indicated in this report, changes will be more fundamental and far reaching than just giving the driver some time off.'
