b"The U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) is committed to facilitating a new era of transportation innovation and safety and ensuring that our country remains a leader in automation. USDOT is acting as a convener and facilitator, partnering with a broad coalition of industry, academic, states and local, safety advocacy, and transportation stakeholders to support the safe development, testing, and integration of automated vehicle technologies.\n\nUSDOT developed the Automated Vehicles Comprehensive Plan to advance the Department's work to prioritize safety while preparing for the future of transportation. Building upon the principles stated in AV 4.0, the plan defines three goals to achieve this vision for Automated Driving Systems (ADS): Promote Collaboration and Transparency, Modernize the Regulatory Environment, and Prepare the Transportation System\n\nUSDOT and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy developed Ensuring American Leadership in Automated Vehicle Technologies: Automated Vehicles 4.0 (AV 4.0). AV 4.0 builds upon Preparing for the Future of Transportation: Automated Vehicles 3.0 (AV 3.0) and expands the scope to 38 relevant United States Government (USG) components that have direct or tangential equities in the safe development and integration of AV technologies. AV 4.0 seeks to ensure a consistent USG approach to AV technologies, and to detail the authorities, research, and investments being made across the USG so that the United States can continue to lead AV technologies\xe2\x80\x99 research, development, and integration.\n\nAV 3.0 builds upon Automated Driving Systems: A Vision for Safety 2.0 (ADS 2.0) and expands the scope to provide an USDOT framework and multimodal approach to the safe integration of AVs into the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s broader surface transportation system.\n\nADS 2.0 is USDOT's cornerstone voluntary guidance document for Automated Driving Systems.\n\nThis webpage provides information about the Comprehensive Management Plan for Automated Vehicle Initiatives, the Department\xe2\x80\x99s recent and upcoming activities related to automation, as well as access to resources for learning more about automated vehicles and data relevant to automation."
