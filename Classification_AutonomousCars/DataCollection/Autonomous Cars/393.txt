b'The most remarkable thing about a ride in a robot car is how unremarkable it is.\n\nIt is definitely eerie to see the steering wheel turn by itself, the car brake and change lanes without human intervention. But just as with cruise control, it soon feels commonplace.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been covering autonomous driving for several years so I\xe2\x80\x99ve taken lots of these rides \xe2\x80\x94 often carefully choreographed to show the cars to best advantage.\n\nFive years ago, I perched nervously in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat of a self-driving Uber Ford Fusion in Pittsburgh, ready to take the wheel as it crisscrossed the city\xe2\x80\x99s notorious bridges. I chugged around the campus of Santa Clara University in a converted golf cart from Auro Robotics, and barreled down Interstate 280 in a self-driving big rig from Otto. Alongside Zoox co-founder Jesse Levinson, who narrated the trip like a proud parent, I wound through narrow San Francisco streets in 2018. Scientists at Stanford University, UC Berkeley and Nissan Research Center told me how they are facilitating communication between robot cars and humans.\n\nWednesday\xe2\x80\x99s jaunt in Waymo\xe2\x80\x99s self-driving Jaguar I-Pace had no surprises. The car smoothly glided to a stop at intersections and signaled before turns. The closest thing to a hiccup was a slight jerkiness when it pulled over to drop off us faux ride-hailing passengers. The company confined our 20-minute test drive to the wide, relatively empty streets of the Sunset District, avoiding the hills and traffic elsewhere in the city, so the car didn\xe2\x80\x99t face any challenges. Ever Guardado, our safety driver, never needed to assume control, but did so once at my request just to demonstrate the tones the car sounds when a driver takes over.\n\nFour years ago when I rode in an earlier-generation Waymo robot car at its testing site on a former military base in Merced County, Waymo staged several complex situations: a bicyclist pedaling alongside, a pedestrian wandering into the crosswalk, a car abruptly cutting off the robot car and boxes sprawling into the road. That robot car, which did not have a person behind the wheel, adapted quickly to all the tests thrown at it.\n\nWaymo, an arm of Google parent Alphabet, now has the distinction of running San Francisco\xe2\x80\x99s first robot taxi service for the public, albeit with backup drivers behind the wheel and limits on how many folks it will accept into its testing program.\n\nJessica Christian/The Chronicle\n\nFleets of robot taxis are how Waymo, Cruise, Zoox and other main contenders in the self-driving race hope to eventually recoup their investors\xe2\x80\x99 multibillion-dollar investments.\n\nWhy test robot taxis in San Francisco?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a major ride-hailing market with a lot of demand from residents,\xe2\x80\x9d said spokesperson Julianne McGoldrick. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the toughest environments for driving \xe2\x80\x94 weather, traffic, road grade, cyclists.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn other words, if a robot car can make it here, it can make it anywhere. That\xe2\x80\x99s also the philosophy of several of Waymo\xe2\x80\x99s competitors, notably GM spin-off Cruise, whose white Chevy Bolts are a common sight on city streets.\n\nWaymo is far along on robot taxis in Phoenix, a much easier city to navigate. It\xe2\x80\x99s given rides to selected testers since 2017, jettisoned the backup drivers since 2019 and now, for almost a year, has been giving hundreds of fully autonomous paid rides \xe2\x80\x94 sans backup driver \xe2\x80\x94 every week to any member of the public who summons one via the Waymo One app, which works pretty much like any other ride-hailing app.\n\nEven when there\xe2\x80\x99s no driver in the car, Waymo has operations specialists who monitor the rides via cameras on the dashboard and the back seat. At a ride\xe2\x80\x99s onset, they check that passengers are buckled up and haven\xe2\x80\x99t brought more than three people along. Riders can talk to them by pressing a button on the app or on a console in the back seat.\n\nJessica Christian/The Chronicle\n\nFor now San Francisco rides are free \xe2\x80\x94 Waymo doesn\xe2\x80\x99t yet have permission to charge a fee. And although it\xe2\x80\x99s had permission since 2018 to ditch backup drivers in California, it has not yet done so. Rival Cruise has been testing some cars without backup drivers in San Francisco for nine months.\n\nBut McGoldrick said its trajectory here to fully autonomous paid rides will be quicker than that in Phoenix.\n\nBack in 2016, lots of smart people said fully autonomous cars would be ubiquitous by 2020. AI researchers told me that their then-toddler-aged kids would never get driver\xe2\x80\x99s licenses.\n\nBut the prospect of robot cars \xe2\x80\x94 and the promise that they\xe2\x80\x99ll improve transportation, end traffic fatalities and reduce congestion \xe2\x80\x94 has stayed tantalizingly out of reach.\n\nAir Quality Tracker Check levels down to the neighborhood Ratings for the Bay Area and California, updated every 10 minutes\n\nThe technology got very far along \xe2\x80\x94 but not all the way. The public got disenchanted, especially after an Uber self-driving car struck and killed a pedestrian in 2018. Companies like Uber and Lyft sold off their self-driving units as the industry consolidated.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe low-hanging fruit in this field is some combination of slow speeds, simple environments and semi-supervised operations,\xe2\x80\x9d Bryant Walker Smith, a longtime industry observer and affiliate scholar at the Stanford Law School Center for Internet and Society, said in an email. \xe2\x80\x9cWaymo and Cruise have long been more interested in moon shots.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJessica Christian/The Chronicle\n\nThose companies need to find \xe2\x80\x9csweet spots that are both technically and financially feasible,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, noting that while Phoenix is technically much easier than the Bay Area, it\xe2\x80\x99s also much less lucrative.\n\nCurrent ride-hailing has low expenses, he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAn Uber trip is basically just a poorly paid driver in a midtier car.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut the robot car fleets, even though they eliminated the labor expenses, have to cover costs for cars that mount up to several hundred thousand dollars each, \xe2\x80\x9cas well as a vast infrastructure for remote human monitoring and support.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTV and movies are replete with far-out images of the future. But I was most struck by a low-tech image in the comedy-drama series \xe2\x80\x9cCasual.\xe2\x80\x9d The final season, which aired in 2018, purportedly took place a couple of years in the future. How the show signaled that: Lead actress Michaela Watkins arrived at her home in a ride-hailing vehicle. The camera briefly panned to show that no one was in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat.\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of naturally interwoven use of robot cars that futurists \xe2\x80\x94 and Waymo, Cruise, etc. \xe2\x80\x94 are betting on.\n\nCarolyn Said is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.
