b"The City of Arlington is committed to managing its infrastructure and technology investments to advance the future of mobility for people, goods and services. Deploying autonomous vehicle technology in real-world environments is one way Arlington has demonstrated its leadership on this issue.\n\nArlington RAPID Program\n\nThe City of Arlington was recently awarded a $1.7 million grant through the Federal Transit Administration\xe2\x80\x99s Integrated Mobility Innovation Program to integrate a fleet of five autonomous vehicles into its Via on-demand rideshare service. This one-year pilot program, called Arlington RAPID (Rideshare, Automation, and Payment Integration Demonstration), is set to begin in March 2021. The City will work with Via, May Mobility, and the University of Texas at Arlington to implement this AV service in an area around Arlington\xe2\x80\x99s Downtown and on UTA\xe2\x80\x99s campus. The autonomous fleet will include a wheelchair-accessible vehicle, and the program will provide a limited number of free rides to UTA students.

The company\xe2\x80\x99s vehicles operated on streets within Arlington's world-class Entertainment District, using an on-demand system to connect passengers with employment centers, restaurants, entertainment venues, and public recreational spaces. After conducting over 760 trips and logging more than 440 miles in autonomous mode, the successful pilot program concluded in May 2019. According to a survey of riders, 98 percent said they felt safe and 91 percent said they thought their ride was smooth.\n\nThis type of innovative transportation technology isn't new for The American Dream City. In 2017, Arlington became the first city in the United States to offer continuous autonomous shuttle service to the public, with the Milo pilot program. Using EasyMile autonomous vehicles, this program operated off-street in the Entertainment District, connecting passengers from parking areas to Arlington\xe2\x80\x99s entertainment venues. The program served over 110 events, and 99% of surveyed riders reported feeling safe and enjoying their ride on Milo.
