Here are three reasons why Autonomous vehicles could one day transform urban transport and make roads safer, but some obstacles need to be overcome first.\n\nposteriori/Shutterstock April 6, 2021 Perfecting self-driving cars \xe2\x80\x93 can it be done? The public holds self-driving cars to incredibly high safety standards \xe2\x80\x93 and we're working to meet them.\n\nA.

VW must think wider and bolder to save the business.\n\n(Shutterstock) November 30, 2020 Who\xe2\x80\x99s to blame when a self-driving car has an accident? As self-driving cars increase in popularity, the question of legal liability remains. The driver, automobile manufacturer and software designers all have a role to play.\n\nWaymo October 14, 2020 Robot take the wheel: Waymo has launched a self-driving taxi service The age of autonomous vehicles is edging closer to reality with the launch of a driverless taxi service in the USA.\n\nGrzegorz Czapski/Shutterstock July 30, 2020 Autonomous cars: five reasons they still aren\xe2\x80\x99t on our roads Despite what Elon Musk says, there are numerous challenges to overcome in creating completely self-driving cars that work in the real world.\n\nRichard Levine/Corbis via Getty Images June 22, 2020 Self-driving taxis could be a setback for those with different needs \xe2\x80\x93 unless companies embrace accessible design now In order to create an efficient future transportation system, autonomous vehicles need to accommodate people with different mobility needs.\n\nSaklakova/iStock/Getty Images Plus April 21, 2020 Linking self-driving cars to traffic signals might help pedestrians give them the green light Pedestrians are wary of autonomous cars, but they trust traffic lights. Researchers suggest driverless cars could communicate directly with the signals to make their own actions more predictable.\n\nYulong Can with data from Baidu Apollo March 6, 2020 Autonomous vehicles can be fooled to \xe2\x80\x98see\xe2\x80\x99 nonexistent obstacles Driverless vehicles rely heavily on sensors to navigate the world. They\xe2\x80\x99re vulnerable to attack if bad actors trick them into \xe2\x80\x98seeing\xe2\x80\x99 things that aren\xe2\x80\x99t there, potentially leading to deadly crashes.\n\nToshifumi Hotchi/Shutterstock February 23, 2020 Billions are pouring into mobility technology \xe2\x80\x93 will the transport revolution live up to the hype? Over US$33 billion was invested in mobility tech last year in response to claims it will transform our lives. Based on what we have seen so far, which of these promised solutions will be delivered?\n\nwww.shutterstock.com January 16, 2020 Vital Signs: the end of the checkout signals a dire future for those without the right skills Technological change has always destroyed jobs. But now automation and artificial intelligence are drying up the options for those displaced.\n\n(Shutterstock) January 5, 2020 Self-driving cars will not fix our transportation woes The sweeping introduction of driverless cars could see more vehicles on the road, driving longer distances. But smart planning could solve some of transit-associated environmental and social problems.\n\nStephen Di Donato/Good Free Photos December 18, 2019 Why Australian road rules should be rewritten to put walking first Most people do not know the right-of-way rules, but a starting point should be that pedestrian needs and safety take priority. Current road rules are biased towards driver convenience\n\nposteriori/Shutterstock November 27, 2019 Driverless vehicles and pedestrians don\xe2\x80\x99t mix. So how do we re-arrange our cities? Self-driving vehicles that constantly roam the streets looking for passengers could overwhelm cities. But, if kept in check, these vehicles could be useful for improving urban transport.\n\nSteven Giles/Shutterstock November 3, 2019 How we feel about our cars means the road to a driverless future may not be smooth Scenarios based on a survey of Adelaide commuters and analyses of traffic flows show it\xe2\x80\x99s possible the congestion could get worse in the transition to driverless vehicles."
