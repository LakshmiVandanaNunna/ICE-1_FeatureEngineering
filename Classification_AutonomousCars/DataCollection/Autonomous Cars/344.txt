b'What is an autonomous vehicle?\n\nThere is a lot of information out there regarding autonomous vehicles. You may have even read several different names or references (autonomous vehicle, automated vehicle, self-driving vehicle, unmanned vehicle, highly automated vehicles, the list goes on!)\n\nWhile some production vehicles on the road today available to consumers introduce some form of automation, commonly reference to as advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), (adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, lane departure assistance, and others), these are not autonomous vehicles. An engaged and fully present driver is required to perform all aspects of the driving task. These technologies do offer tremendous safety promise, as they can prevent or lessen the severity of a crash. CDOT is evaluating how roadway design (striping, pavement markings, and signs) can improve the performance of these driver assistance technologies.\n\nThere are manufacturers and other companies that are interested in testing, deploying and researching vehicles that change the basic architecture of the vehicle or remove the human driver. Understanding innovations in technology and the recent focus on advancing highly automated vehicles limiting the need for a human, the State of Colorado has adopted legislative policy that provides definition to highly automated vehicles or driving systems. Vehicles meeting this definition must go through a process detailed in the Policy section of this page.'
