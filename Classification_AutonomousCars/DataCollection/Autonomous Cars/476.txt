b'These Vehicles Can Almost Drive Themselves There is no such thing as a self-driving car. Let\xe2\x80\x99s make that clear right away, not a single car on the road today can operate in all types of weather and driving conditions without any human intervention. That type of vehicle, one with what\xe2\x80\x99s called Level 5 autonomy (which we\'ll explain in further detail later), remains years into the future. This doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean many cars on sale today don\xe2\x80\x99t have impressive technology that\xe2\x80\x99s making them increasingly smarter and safer. Some of these driving aids are targeted at reducing driver stress, by taking over some or all steering functions, or automatically matching the car\xe2\x80\x99s speed to posted road signs. Certain systems, like Cadillac\xe2\x80\x99s Super Cruise, can only be used within specific parameters, such as pre-mapped divided highways with dedicated on- and off-ramps. There are also a number of active safety features, such as automatic emergency braking, that help minimize the risk of an accident by stopping the car if sensors detect an obstacle. While the era of robot cars hasn\xe2\x80\x99t yet arrived, let\xe2\x80\x99s look at examples of self-driving technology available today.\n\n<h3><strong>What Are the Levels of Vehicle Autonomy?</strong></h3> <p>To make things as simple as possible, let\xe2\x80\x99s explain the five levels of vehicle autonomy before we look at the cars and SUVs on this list. The levels of autonomy are determined by SAE International, a professional group of worldwide engineers devoted to establishing standardized values for the transportation field. To better understand self-driving cars, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand each level of autonomy.</p> <p>Level 0 means the car is always under human control. Cars in this category can have active safety features, like automatic emergency braking and forward collision warning, but these features only offer visual or audible alerts, and they never actively control the car.</p> <p>Level 1 vehicles might include adaptive cruise control or lane keep assist. These safety features are capable of providing a small degree of steering, acceleration, or braking input. However, their primary focus is accident avoidance. </p> <p>Level 2 autonomy entails several active safety features working in unison to take some degree of driving duty away from the driver. Onboard cameras and radar sensors could keep the car driving at a steady speed in its intended lane of travel, for example, and clear of surrounding vehicles. At this level you\xe2\x80\x99ll find a number of today\xe2\x80\x99s self-driving systems, such as Cadillac Super Cruise and Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s AutoPilot. One key thing to remember: A Level 2 vehicle requires the driver to remain focused on the road. This can be done via cameras that monitor the driver\xe2\x80\x99s eyes or sensors that can tell if the driver lets go of the steering wheel.</p> <p>At Level 3, a vehicle takes over all driving controls in select conditions and allows the driver to focus elsewhere. These conditions might be specific types of highway, or geofenced locations. The vehicle may not be able to drive itself in poor weather.</p> <p>At Level 4, the self-driving car is able to adapt to more road and weather conditions. The limitations of Level 3 are lessened, and the vehicle theoretically requires almost no driver input.</p> <p>Finally, at Level 5, the car drives all the time, no matter the type of road or weather outside. This robo-car is the end game for self-driving technology, though it remains years into the future.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>2020 Tesla Model S</strong></h3> <p><strong>Price w/ Autonomous Driving Features: $69,420 | U.S. News Overall Score: 9.0/10</strong></p> <p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s start with the car company and electric-powered sedan that put self-driving technology on the map. True, the idea of robo-cars didn\xe2\x80\x99t start with Tesla, but the Silicon Valley-based automaker has put them front and center in terms of cutting-edge car technology. </p> <p>Every <a href="/cars-trucks/tesla/model-s/2020">Model S</a> is fitted with Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s AutoPilot self-driving aid, though you can upgrade to the Full Self-Driving Capability package for an extra $8,000. While AutoPilot maintains vehicle speed and keeps the Model S in its intended lane of travel, Full Self-Driving Capability allows for lane changes (if the sensors detect it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to do so), automatic parking assist, and a mode to summon the car from a parking spot. </p> <p>Tesla remains at the forefront of this technology, though the company\xe2\x80\x99s reputation has been dinged by high profile accidents while its vehicles were operating with some degree of autonomy. This has often been linked to driver inattention, though the fact that AutoPilot usage is not geo-fenced to certain roads \xe2\x80\x93 such as the next system we\xe2\x80\x99re going to discuss \xe2\x80\x93 has been a heated safety topic.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>2020 Cadillac CT6</strong></h3> <p><strong>Price w/ Autonomous Driving Features: $74,495 | U.S. News Overall Score: 7.2/10</strong></p> <p>While Tesla has adopted a more free-spirited attitude to self-driving assistance, the Cadillac Super Cruise system takes a more measured approach. Like Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s AutoPilot, when Super Cruise is in operation the car maintains its speed, distance to other vehicles, and adheres to its intended lane of travel. </p> <p>Unlike some rival lane keep assist technology, Super Cruise is credited for being very smooth and avoiding the \xe2\x80\x98ping-pong\xe2\x80\x99 feel that other systems cause as onboard sensors read and respond to lane markings. This is a hands-free system, but a camera in the interior keeps an eye on the driver to make certain they\xe2\x80\x99re looking ahead and paying attention. If that isn\xe2\x80\x99t the case, Super Cruise will issue a series of visual and audible alerts. Should this still not get the driver\xe2\x80\x99s attention, the car will turn on its hazard lights and slow to a stop in its lane of travel.</p> <p>Available on the <a href="/cars-trucks/cadillac/ct6/2020">CT6</a> luxury sedan in the Premium Luxury trim level, Super Cruise can only be activated on divided highways with dedicated on-ramps and off-ramps. </p> <p>As of this writing, roughly 130,000 miles of roads throughout North America have been programmed into Super Cruise. For the 2021 model year, this technology will be available in the new <a href="/cars-trucks/cadillac/escalade/2021">Escalade</a> full-size SUV, along with the <a href="/cars-trucks/cadillac/ct4/2020">CT4</a> and <a href="/cars-trucks/cadillac/ct5/2020">CT5</a> sedans.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>2020 Nissan Rogue</strong></h3> <p><strong>Price w/ Autonomous Driving Features: $28,670 | U.S. News Overall Score: 7.6/10</strong></p> <p>Nissan takes a slightly simpler approach with its self-driving technology. Called ProPilot Assist, the system is available on the compact <a href="/cars-trucks/nissan/rogue/2020">Rogue</a> SUV and <a href="/cars-trucks/nissan/leaf/2020">Leaf</a> electric hatchback. </p> <p>While it\xe2\x80\x99s similar to Super Cruise in that the system maintains speed and a safe distance to vehicles ahead, the steering requires the driver\xe2\x80\x99s hands to remain on the wheel. ProPilot offers more of a gentle nudge in corners, though sharper bends will cause it to default back to the driver\'s control. </p> <p>Nissan touts ProPilot Assist as a way to relieve daily driving stresses and it will feature in more models in the years ahead. A more advanced ProPilot Assist 2.0 system is also on the road, though it\xe2\x80\x99s not yet in the U.S. market.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>2020 BMW X7</strong></h3> <p><strong>Price w/ Autonomous Driving Features: $75,600 | U.S. News Overall Score: 7.7/10</strong></p> <p>The <a href="/cars-trucks/bmw/x7/2020">BMW X7</a> is the German automaker\xe2\x80\x99s largest SUV and one of several models in which you can order hands-free parallel parking assist, along with traffic jam assist.
