b'Automated Vehicles (AVs) use sensors and computer systems to drive themselves. Often called "self-driving" cars, AVs partially or entirely remove the need for a driver to control the vehicle.\n\n\n\nConnected and automated vehicles could increase travel options and make our roads safer. ODOT is monitoring technology developments, evaluating safety benefits and exploring ways connected and automated vehicles can increase mobility options for Oregonians.\n\n\n\nODOT is the lead agency coordinating autonomous vehicle programs and policies in Oregon, as designated by the Legislature in House Bill 4063 of 2018\n\nWhy do we need AV technology?\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says 94 percent of vehicle crashes are caused by human error. The majority of crashes are caused by 1) recognition errors, where drivers are not paying attention to the road or the vehicles around them; and, 2) decision errors, such as speeding, performing illegal maneuvers and misjudging gaps between vehicles or others\xe2\x80\x99 speed. Automated vehicles could eliminate the majority of these crashes.\n\nWhile automated vehicle systems require much more testing and validation before they are ready for commercial deployment, engineers are working to ensure they drive safely, closely follow traffic laws, and respond appropriately to changing road conditions. Automated vehicles do not get distracted and can monitor their environment in 360-degree, high-precision 3D.\n\nAutomated vehicles can also provide increased mobility to seniors, children, people with disabilities and others who are unable or choose not to drive. They could operate more efficiently than conventional vehicles, reducing congestion and emissions.\n\nSAE, the Society of Automotive Engineers, identified six levels of vehicle automation starting with Level 0, or no automation whatsoever, through Level 5, in which the vehicle has complete control. SAE, the Society of Automotive Engineers, identified six levels of vehicle automation starting with Level 0, or no automation whatsoever, through Level 5, in which the vehicle has complete control.\n\nYou might already be driving a vehicle that is above Level 0. Level 1 automation includes automatic transmission, lane-keeping technologies and assisted cruise control. Level 2 includes some of these technologies working in conjunction (such as in Tesla\'s autopilot mode). It is Levels 3 through 5 where the Office of Innovative Funding is focusing its attention.\n\n\n\nOregon\'s Task Force on Autonomous Vehicles Created by\n\nCreated by House Bill 4063 , signed by Gov. Kate Brown on April 10, 2018, ODOT was named the state\'s lead agency on automated vehicle policy (as recommended by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration). It also directed ODOT to facilitate a Task Force on Autonomous Vehicles and report to the legislature with legislative recommendations. Per HB 4063, the task force dissolved in January 2021.\n\nThe Task Force issued two reports: September 2018 Report\n\n\n\nSeptember 2019 Report Members of the task force were:\n\nChair: Lt.

We have a voluntary testing notification form to initiate the exchange of information between AV manufacturers and the agency.\n\nOregon does not currently regulate AV testing, but the voluntary notification process allows ODOT to provide safety information to interested companies on work zones and lane closures on proposed test routes and dates. It also enables us to solicit feedback from AV system developers on how to engage the industry, and to track the progress of AV testing in the state.\n\nLevels of automation'
