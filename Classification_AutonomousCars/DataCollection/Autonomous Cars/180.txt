b'While the major automakers are developing autonomous vehicles behind closed doors, we were able to experience Audi\xe2\x80\x99s latest prototype at Las Vegas\xe2\x80\x99 CES show in January. California, Florida, Michigan, and Nevada are the only states, along with Washington, D.C., that currently allow companies to test such vehicles on public roads.\n\nAudi\xe2\x80\x99s A7 test car is equipped with the company\xe2\x80\x99s traffic-jam assist feature, which uses an array of cameras, sensors, and radar to let the car take over the driving in highway traffic. In the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat was Bj\xc3\xb6rn Giesler, Ph.D., project leader for development of piloted driving at Audi AG, and in the backseat was an engineer equipped with a laptop and radio to monitor the system and communicate with our police escorts and other Audi vehicles.\n\nDuring rush-hour traffic, we headed out on Route 15, one of Las Vegas\xe2\x80\x99 major freeways. With the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s speed under 40 mph, a notification appeared that the system\xe2\x80\x99s pilot mode was available. Then with the push of a button on the steering wheel, the car took control and the instrument cluster graphic changed to an illustration of the road with vehicles in the lanes.\n\nAs Giesler took his hands off the wheel and his foot off the pedals, the vehicle seamlessly followed the car in front at a safe distance. When a vehicle cut into our lane, the A7 automatically slowed down and adjusted the distance. When that car moved out of the lane, our car again closed the gap with the next car in front. The driver can turn off the system at any time by placing his hands on the steering wheel and foot back on the pedals.\n\nWith the A7 in control, the driver could do other things, although sleeping was not one of them. The vehicle was equipped with two cameras with facial recognition that monitored the driver\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. Giesler showed off that feature in an unnerving moment. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to lie to you, this is still pretty scary for me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said as he pretended to sleep. After about 10 seconds the vehicle noticed. An audible alert sounded and, when he still didn\xe2\x80\x99t open his eyes, the vehicle shut down in the middle of the highway and activated the hazard lights. That is a safeguard on the prototype A7 in case the driver is ill or incapacitated. But production cars will be designed so that they can make autonomous lane changes, which will allow the vehicle to safely pull off the road.\n\nDuring the demonstration, Giesler pointed out an eye-opening reminder of how quickly the technology is advancing. The previous year the test car\xe2\x80\x99s trunk was filled with three desktop-sized computers to make the system work. This year the hardware had been reduced to the size of a small box, which was tucked away in the trunk\xe2\x80\x99s side storage compartment.\n\nOverall we were quite impressed with the Audi\xe2\x80\x99s capabilities. The company expects the technology to be available in a production car within five years.'
