b'With the explosion of data, every application is now a data application. Learn why this has hundreds of software teams building their applications in the cloud across multiple use cases and industries.\n\nPresented by Pony.ai\n\nThe vision of safe, reliable autonomous vehicle transportation at scale is closer than ever to being realized, says James Peng, CEO at Pony.ai. Since the company\xe2\x80\x99s founding in Fremont, California in late 2016, the company\xe2\x80\x99s been making strides in autonomous mobility deployment in both the U.S. and China. The company was the first to launch and offer a public-facing Robotaxi service in both countries.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe technology is moving from experience-level to application,\xe2\x80\x9d Peng says. \xe2\x80\x9cThe first half of the game is to build stable and mature products and accumulate experience. The second half is to move from R&D to mass production and scale, in addition to achieving commercially viable products.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn 2019, Peng predicted that the world would see a wide adoption of fully autonomous driving vehicles on the open roads within five years, and that forecast is gaining momentum. Pony.ai just received a driverless permit from California DMV, a milestone for their engineers to perform driverless testing without a human driver behind the wheel on public roads within the state. These tests are accelerating commercial growth across their operation sites worldwide, and they plan to launch driverless Robotaxi service to the public in California starting in 2022.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m pretty confident that in many of the larger cities in the U.S., people will soon be able to ride with a driverless Robotaxi vehicle,\xe2\x80\x9d says Tiancheng Lou, CTO at Pony.ai. \xe2\x80\x9cA significant portion of taxi services will be supported by driverless vehicles.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPony.ai currently offers ride-hailing in its autonomous vehicles in five markets: Irvine and Fremont in California; as well as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou in China. The company plans to install its technology in hundreds of vehicles next year, rising to tens of thousands in 2024-2025.\n\nWaymo, Google\xe2\x80\x99s self-driving car arm, has been piloting a fleet of fully driverless robotaxis in Phoenix for the past year, while Amazon-owned Zoox unveiled its autonomous robotaxi service last December.\n\nThe goals of autonomous driving\n\nAccording to most companies, the biggest benefit of autonomous driving is safety. The U.S. Department of Transportation has reported that 94% of car crashes are caused by human error. While overall driving was down in 2020 because of the pandemic, traffic fatality rates surged 24% \xe2\x80\x94 the highest spike in nearly a century. Autonomous driving is the solution to this issue, Peng says, and companies like Pony.ai, Google, and Uber, along with most of the major automakers, are sinking considerable money into R&D, optimistic about the future of autonomous driving.\n\nA transition to autonomous vehicles also has potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and support U.S. economic growth, points out the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets. The coalition, which includes members Ford, Volvo, Lyft, Uber, and Waymo, promotes the benefits of fully self-driving vehicles and supports the fastest deployment possible \xe2\x80\x93 or advancing the scale of the technology, which would enable mass production and start moving autonomous vehicles to the center of the smart city vision.\n\nChallenges of driving autonomy at scale\n\nPony is hoping to achieve large enough scale to reduce costs and meet commercial needs by 2022 with Alpha X, the working name for their latest generation of autonomous vehicles, Lou says, which are designed to be manufactured on a production line.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo have a large number of vehicles, we need to manufacture them in a standardized way,\xe2\x80\x9d Lou says. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a critical step to achieve front-loading mass production of self-driving cars.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe company established a production line and a set of standardized processes specifically for L4-level autonomous driving systems last November. With the support of the production line, the production efficiency of the autonomous driving system doubled six times compared with the previous generation, and production pace accelerated.\n\nWith PonyAlpha X, they established a L4 level autonomous driving system scale production line, Lou says. To manufacture the vehicle, they established a supply chain management process, hardware module design and verification, test production, and car conversion before final assembly. The end phase consists of overall quality inspection, off-line calibration, and road testing. The project helps them set up a standardized production process, which shortened production time, effectively reduced costs, and improved the stability of the overall system.\n\nCompared with the previous generation, PonyAlpha X is more compact, integrated, and lightweight in terms of system hardware integration, reducing the cost of post-maintenance. They recently partnered with Toyota to equip PonyAlpha X on Lexus RX models.\n\nIn February of this year, the company rolled out the new self-driving vehicles equipped with the latest generation system from the standardized production line. The cars will go through all-day autonomous-driving open-road tests in Guangzhou, Beijing, and Shanghai before they join the company\xe2\x80\x99s Robotaxi fleet for large-scale operations.\n\nTheir recent partnership with Luminar, an autonomous vehicle sensor and software company, has also allowed them to significantly bring down the cost of manufacturing, which is always a major hurdle for mass production.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the next generation, one of the biggest challenges is we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to use auto-grade sensors,\xe2\x80\x9d Lou says. \xe2\x80\x9cOne of the critical pieces is Luminar LiDAR. Using that LiDAR, we\xe2\x80\x99re moving one step toward to being ready for mass production, and then we can prepare for large scale production. Luminar LiDAR, compared to our current solution, is more reliable and much cheaper.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLiDAR is a laser sensor that sends millions of laser points out per second and measures how long they take to bounce back, a key component to safe autonomous driving. Luminar says that its Iris LiDAR has a maximum range of 500 meters (1,640 feet), including 250-meter range with less than 10 percent reflectivity. The self-driving sensor solution offers better perception accuracy and field of view breadth to enhance the ability to cope with long-tail scenarios. The new pony vehicles with Luminar\xe2\x80\x99s LiDAR sensor will be up and running in 2022, and will be ready for the company\xe2\x80\x99s robotaxi customers in 2023.\n\nAutonomous driving at scale is, literally, in sight\n\nThe past year hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been easy, Lou says, but it pushed their contactless delivery initiative further along in Irvine, which helped the community cope during the pandemic, while adding testing and collecting mileage for data points. But full autonomy at scale still requires testing.\n\nTo help accelerate their commercial growth and global deployment, they\xe2\x80\x99ve tapped Lawrence Steyn, vice chairman of investment banking at JPMorgan Chase & Co, as chief financial officer.\n\nAnd looking ahead, in 10 years or 20 years, it could be possible that owning a vehicle would entirely be a luxury, Lou says.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe need to carefully think about whether that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary, having personal vehicles,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it\xe2\x80\x99s mathematically possible to get a vehicle within as little as 30 seconds, most people may not have to own a vehicle.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe also points out that if most vehicles are running autonomously, the vehicle form factor can be reshaped for accessibility, opening up safe transportation for a larger population of older and disabled riders who could turn to cheaper, more efficient autonomous transportation for their travel needs.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI still keep the engineering part in me, and with that part, I dream of pushing the world forward with state-of-art technology,\xe2\x80\x9d Peng says. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are working hard to largely scale and deploy our technology across countries and regions to benefit more and more people.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDig deeper.
