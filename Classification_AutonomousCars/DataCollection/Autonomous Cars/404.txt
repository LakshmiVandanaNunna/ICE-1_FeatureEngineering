b'NHTSA In Action NHTSA is dedicated to advancing the lifesaving potential of new vehicle technologies\n\nNHTSA demonstrates its dedication to saving lives on our nation\xe2\x80\x99s roads and highways through its proactive and inclusive approach to the safe development, testing, and deployment of new and advanced vehicle technologies that have enormous potential for improving safety and mobility for all Americans, NHTSA demonstrates its dedication to saving lives on our nation\xe2\x80\x99s roads and highways.\n\nIn September 2016, NHTSA and the U.S. Department of Transportation issued the Federal Automated Vehicles Policy which set forth a proactive approach to providing safety assurance and facilitating innovation. Building on that policy and incorporating feedback received through public comments, stakeholder meetings, and Congressional hearings, in September 2017, the agency issued, Automated Driving Systems: A Vision for Safety 2.0. The updated guidance, 2.0, offers a flexible, nonregulatory approach to automated vehicle technology safety, by supporting the automotive industry and other key stakeholders as they consider and design best practices for the safe testing and deployment of ADS levels 3 through 5. It also provides technical assistance to states and best practices for policymakers regarding ADS.\n\nIn October 2018, U.S. DOT released Preparing for the Future of Transportation: Automated Vehicles 3.0, which builds upon \xe2\x80\x94 but does not replace \xe2\x80\x94 the voluntary guidance provided in 2.0. AV 3.0 expands the scope to all surface on-road transportation systems, and was developed through input from a diverse set of stakeholder engagements throughout the nation. AV 3.0 is structured around three key areas:\n\nAdvancing multi-modal safety, Reducing policy uncertainty, and Outlining a process for working with U.S. DOT.\n\nEnsuring American Leadership in Automated Vehicle Technologies: Automated Vehicles 4.0 was released in January 2020. AV 4.0 builds upon AV 3.0 by expanding the scope to 38 relevant United States Government (USG) components that have direct or tangential equities in safe development and integration of AV technologies. AV 4.0 is structured around three key areas:\n\nUSG AV principles, Administration efforts supporting AV technology growth and leadership, and USG activities and opportunities for collaboration.\n\nAs automated technologies advance, so will the department\xe2\x80\x99s guidance. The guidance is intended to be flexible and to evolve as technology does, but with safety always as the top priority.'
