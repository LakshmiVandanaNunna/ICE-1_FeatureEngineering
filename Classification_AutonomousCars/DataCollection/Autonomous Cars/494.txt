b'You\xe2\x80\x99re driving down a busy road and notice that an out-of-place traffic cone near a construction site ahead will send you into the opposing lane for a moment. Oh, and that pedestrian looks as if he might jaywalk in front of you, and that guy in the SUV sure is riding your rear bumper\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nOdds are you\xe2\x80\x99ll do just fine. You\xe2\x80\x99ll make the right adjustments in braking and accelerating, picking just the right moment to go in and out of your lane, all while carrying on a conversation with your passenger.\n\nGenerally, human drivers do relatively well with this kind of complexity. We\xe2\x80\x99re able to respond to the out-of-the-ordinary intuitively.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOn the other hand, we get bored, tired, and easily distracted. Even with all the improvements in automotive safety over the years and depressed vehicle miles traveled from the COVID-19 pandemic, an estimated 38,000 Americans died on the roads in 2020.\n\nAutonomous vehicles have long been promised as the solution, with their sensors that see far ahead in all kinds of weather and their ever-vigilant computers that follow the rules of the road with hyper focus.\n\nBut the reality is more complex. As often happens with new technologies, some challenges are harder than they seemed at first. In fact, the industry is going through a bit of a reset, with companies like Uber and Lyft selling their autonomous vehicle units.\n\nWhy is autonomy hard? The roadways are highly cluttered with many sizes and shapes of obstacles; various objects move in and out quickly and unpredictably; and human behavior is difficult for a machine to predict. Whenever people \xe2\x80\x9cact naturally\xe2\x80\x9d during an odd scenario, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good time to worry about autonomous vehicles.\n\nFor a long time, the answer appeared to be to let an autonomous vehicle do the bulk of the driving, but only with a human behind the wheel, ready to take over in case of failure. The best of both worlds, right?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nUnfortunately, no.\n\nResearch has shown that humans make poor safety drivers. By the time they gain situational awareness in an emergency, it\xe2\x80\x99s often too late to react. In fact, relying upon \xe2\x80\x9chuman fallback\xe2\x80\x9d might actually be more dangerous than fully automated systems.\n\nFurther, the approach of using virtual simulations to prove system safety is facing a harsh reality: The endlessly complex environment, coupled with constantly evolving hardware and software, means that relying upon systems to drive millions of simulated miles, while necessary, is insufficient.\n\nSo, the promise of widely deployed self-driving vehicles remains elusive.\n\nWe still think it\xe2\x80\x99s likely that highly automated vehicles, in some form and performing certain tasks, will become a reality. Where we first see these systems on the roads is uncertain: Maybe electric vehicles \xe2\x80\x94 cheaper to produce than complex gas vehicles \xe2\x80\x94 will include expensive autonomous systems; or maybe autonomous freight trucks on highways may have the right economic incentives for autonomy adoption.\n\nRegardless of which operational model succeeds, we believe there are four major steps we can take in the short term:\n\nLet autonomous vehicles communicate with one another through connected vehicle technology \xe2\x80\x94 The world is a complex place for autonomous vehicles. Weather makes it hard to virtually \xe2\x80\x9csee\xe2\x80\x9d with sensors; emergency responders alter the roadways to make accident scenes safe; and people around the vehicle are hidden by buildings and foliage. Any technology that simplifies this world is crucial to fast and safe adoption of these capabilities. Connected vehicle technology lets these systems \xe2\x80\x9ctalk\xe2\x80\x9d with each other and with the world around them, sharing information about traffic, objects, and intended vehicle paths. To make this vision a reality, industry and the government must come together to implement and standardize these communications, as well as invest in necessary infrastructure.\n\nThe world is a complex place for autonomous vehicles.

Share hard problems, challenging scenarios, and safety data \xe2\x80\x94 As safety issues, technical limitations, or hard scenarios are discovered, industry should share non-proprietary information to look for system-wide issues. Transportation sectors, like aviation and traditional ground transportation, have programs to share data and foster safety cultures across the industry. Highly automated vehicle developers must be encouraged or required to do the same.\n\nAs safety issues, technical limitations, or hard scenarios are discovered, industry should share non-proprietary information to look for system-wide issues.

Establish a corporate culture of safety \xe2\x80\x94 If autonomous vehicles are to succeed, the industry must have a clear focus on safety \xe2\x80\x94 from the boardroom to the test engineer. A \xe2\x80\x9cpositive safety culture\xe2\x80\x9d throughout an organization is critical in preventing accidents and avoiding hidden risks. In other words, what\xe2\x80\x99s needed is a culture that encourages, not punishes, employees for reporting safety issues.\n\nIf autonomous vehicles are to succeed, the industry must have a clear focus on safety \xe2\x80\x94 from the boardroom to the test engineer.

Certify these non-human drivers \xe2\x80\x94 Human beings are required to pass a driving test before getting behind the wheel. But currently, highly automated vehicle systems are not. Right now, the regulatory landscape and certification process is uncertain and piecemeal. Yet the answer seems clear: There should be an \xe2\x80\x9cautonomous vehicle driving test.\xe2\x80\x9d To do this, government agencies should divvy up responsibilities between federal, state, and local partners, and create a clear path to certification.\n\nThrough decades of development and delayed rollout, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that developing safe and functional autonomous vehicles is not as easy as it may appear. But we truly believe that self-driving vehicles are in our future. This future will come down the road more quickly and safely if government and industry work together to share knowledge and attack the hard problems facing autonomous vehicles.\n\nZach LaCelle is a robotics and autonomy expert and leader of MITRE\xe2\x80\x99s Mobile Autonomous Systems Experimentation (MASE) lab.
