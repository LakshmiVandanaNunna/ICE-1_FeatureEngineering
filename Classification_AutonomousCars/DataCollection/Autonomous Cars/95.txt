b'Last summer, I asked (with a hint of frustration) where my totally self-driving car was. After all, it was 2020, and I had accumulated a slew of statements from years past that promised millions of them would be on the road by then.\n\nNow, we\xe2\x80\x99re well into 2021, and I\xe2\x80\x99m starting to get discouraged.\n\nFirst, Christopher Mims of The Wall Street Journal reported a few weeks ago that some experts now say, despite an accumulated investment of more than $80 billion toward research and technology, that \xe2\x80\x9cwe may never get the self-driving cars we were promised.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThen, I spoke to an expert I\xe2\x80\x99ve known for years, who told me basically the same thing.\n\nActually, that\xe2\x80\x99s not entirely true. Francesco Biondi did tell me we might see such a car, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I think it will probably be toward the end of my lifetime.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe is 33. I don\xe2\x80\x99t stand a chance.\n\nAll those dreams I had of a car that would take me to doctor appointments in my old age, drop me off at the door, park itself, then come get me when I was done? Poof! Up in smoke, like so many semi-autonomous cars that run into things.\n\nBiondi used to be an assistant professor at the University of Utah, where he conducted tests on volunteers who drove back and forth to Wendover in semi-autonomous cars. They drove one way manually and let the car handle much of the driving in the other direction. They wore contraptions that measured brain waves and had video recorders trained on them, which eventually demonstrated that people tend to lose focus when their cars automatically stay in their lanes and brake for traffic ahead.\n\nWhich is a problem, because those cars aren\xe2\x80\x99t really ready to drive themselves.\n\nIn other words, it\xe2\x80\x99s more dangerous to drive today\xe2\x80\x99s semi-autonomous cars than to pilot that old, dusty beater that requires you to do everything \xe2\x80\x94 brake, accelerate, turn, switch on the radio and watch out for the other guy \xe2\x80\x94 all by yourself.\n\nIf your beater has a manual transmission, you don\xe2\x80\x99t even have a hand free to text while driving.\n\nRelated Legislature approves bill allowing driverless cars on Utah roads\n\nToday, Biondi is a fully tenured assistant professor at the University of Windsor, in Canada. His window lets him look across the river toward Detroit, which once was the symbol of America\xe2\x80\x99s booming automobile industry. He\xe2\x80\x99s still very much involved in similar research.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think that the industry assumed it would be much easier,\xe2\x80\x9d he said about self-driving cars. The reason they were wrong is something that ought to make all of us feel proud:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs much as we like to think that humans are not as smart as machines \xe2\x80\xa6 that\xe2\x80\x99s far from being the case. Even after years of testing, autonomous cars are unable to match the human driver\xe2\x80\x99s performances. There are a lot of scenarios \xe2\x80\x94 weather conditions, road conditions \xe2\x80\x94 where these cars are not as smart as we want them to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSo, rogue machines aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to take over the world any time soon. That\xe2\x80\x99s good news, even though it won\xe2\x80\x99t help me get to the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s office as an old man.\n\nAnd yet that message doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be widespread knowledge. At least, that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the case last April in Texas when two men decided to go for a ride in a Tesla, with one apparently in the back seat and the other in the front passenger seat \xe2\x80\x94 and no one behind the wheel.\n\nThe New York Times said their wives overheard the men talking about the car\xe2\x80\x99s autopilot features as they left. They died when the car left the road on a steep turn.\n\nBiondi said evidence shows many people who buy semi-autonomous cars overestimate what they can do. Dealerships sometimes oversell the products or leave out information about limitations.\n\nMims, of The Wall Street Journal, suggests some experts think the whole idea needs to be rethought. They want to approach the necessary artificial intelligence by building systems that learn the way human babies do. Others want to divide the problem into smaller chunks, developing systems that each handle a piece of the puzzle.\n\nBiondi said he thinks commercial trucking shows more promise at the moment, especially if it involves dedicating lanes of traffic for that use only.\n\nTo me, it all sounds long and laborious and so \xe2\x80\xa6 well \xe2\x80\xa6 20th century.\n\nIt also sounds like I\xe2\x80\x99d better be prepared for that day when, as with my Dad and those before him, the kids discreetly take my keys from me and, in my decrepit state, I have to bum a ride to the doctor. What a bother.\n\nJay Evensen is a senior columnist for Deseret News.'
