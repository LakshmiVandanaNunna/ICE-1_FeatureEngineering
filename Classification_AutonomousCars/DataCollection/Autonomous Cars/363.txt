Pennsylvania\xe2\x80\x99s world-class research universities have continually served as a breeding ground for technological advances, with Carnegie Mellon University known as the "birthplace of self-driving vehicles" and the University of Pennsylvania\xe2\x80\x99s robotics research program is renowned worldwide. Without doubt, Pennsylvania has emerged as a leading location for on\xe2\x80\x90road testing of HAVs as they steadily advance toward practical use.\n\n\n\nPennDOT has supported these advances in automation through the deployment of Dedicated Short-Range Communication (DSRC) Roadside Units (RSUs) at select signalized intersections to enable communications between the vehicles and the infrastructure. PennDOT has also been active in national efforts to develop uniform standards and practices for HAVs. With the pace of HAV innovation accelerating, Transportation Secretary Yassmin Gramian, P.E., challenged PennDOT to take action to sustain Pennsylvania\xe2\x80\x99s leadership in HAV research, while simultaneously ensuring that public safety remains the paramount priority as HAVs are tested on the roadways.\n\nContent Editor \xe2\x80\xad[2]\xe2\x80\xac\n\n\n\n'
