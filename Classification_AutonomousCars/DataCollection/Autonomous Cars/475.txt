b'Voyage, an autonomous vehicle (AV) startup based in Silicon Valley, is building the technology and services to bring autonomous transportation to those who need it most, beginning in retirement communities. To develop, manage, and accelerate their AV development process, Voyage has been working with Applied Intuition (Applied) and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Leveraging Applied\xe2\x80\x99s solution deployed on AWS, Voyage is able to quickly test and iterate on hundreds of drive scenarios and thousands of permutations. This enables them to debug and validate their autonomy software, while also ensuring that code changes are additive and the overall functioning of their AV stack is maintained. As a result, Voyage has reduced expensive on-road testing to validate software fixes and has accelerated their AV development cycle by 25%. This, in turn, has enabled Voyage to scale up operations rapidly, from a retirement community in San Jose with 4,000 residents to a retirement city in Florida with 125,000-residents, in less than two years.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have access to the world\xe2\x80\x99s best simulation environment powered by Applied Intuition and AWS. We test hundreds of scenarios and thousands of permutations on every code change. There are very few ways to accelerate engineering 10x, but this is one.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n- Oliver Cameron, Co-Founder & CEO, Voyage\n\n'
