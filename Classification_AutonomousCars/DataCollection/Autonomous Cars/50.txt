b'LIDAR\n\nAn autonomous car will use sensors that \xe2\x80\x9cpeer\xe2\x80\x9d through plastics like Light Imaging Detection and Radar (LIDAR) to successfully navigate paved roadways and off-road trails. LIDAR uses lasers to create a 3D map of the world in real time, on the fly, detecting obstacles and identifying the shapes and boundaries within and along a roadway. Thermoplastics, like polycarbonate, permit light and imaging transparency. Integrating thermoplastics and plastic films into front grills and bumpers can allow engineers to mount LIDAR detection sensors \xe2\x80\x9cinvisibly\xe2\x80\x9d into the design of a vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s grill, side panels or bumpers.\n\nEngineers calibrate plastics materials to allow certain radio frequency signal wavelengths to pass through them, undisturbed. Plastics can achieve permeability or, signal transparency, as on today\xe2\x80\x99s cell tower beaming covers. This quality will allow future V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle) communication in a car and through the transportation infrastructure.\n\nDurable plastic network vehicle charging stations, traffic flow monitors, stop light timers, lane diversion signals, temporary barriers, travel direction signs, and police and fire right-of-way equipment will allow infrastructure communication to vehicles emitting similar signals to maintain safety and flow. Plastics will not only be essential to autonomous vehicles, they will be essential to the transformative infrastructure.'
