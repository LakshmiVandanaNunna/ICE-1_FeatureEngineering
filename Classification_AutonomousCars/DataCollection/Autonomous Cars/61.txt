We consult to stakeholders both inside and outside of the United States.\n\nThrough research, teaching, and work with decision makers in administrations, with technologists and business leaders from AV companies and startups, and with other practicing professionals from the autonomous vehicles space, the initiative seeks to improve policymakers\xe2\x80\x99 capacity to deal with a fast emerging technology. They find actionable policy and strategy options to create infrastructure that is livable for humans and AVs, and that helps to mitigate the social consequences of the AV revolution.'
