b'Sensor Integration\n\nComponents like radar, LiDAR and cameras are used to provide the distance to objects that surround the vehicle. If the exact location of the surrounding objects is known, this technology can provide the absolute vehicle location with assistance from a high amount of map data. When integrated with complimentary technology such as: ultrasonic, inertial motion, digital maps, radar/LiDAR and cameras, GNSS acts as the sixth sense to deliver the positioning performance required by autonomous vehicles.\n\nMany technologies onboard vehicles provide local or relative localization. GNSS provides an absolute localization solution, and with the following technologies can achieve the accuracy and availability requirements of a full autonomous driving solution.\n\nSPAN\xc2\xae GNSS+INS Navigation\n\nWith the growing developments in automotive technology, the need for accurate, reliable and robust ground reference has emerged. Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) + Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) are an essential component of achieving high accuracy ground truth, mobile mapping and real-time precise positioning for autonomy. NovAtel delivers SPAN\xc2\xae GNSS+INS technology in easy-to-integrate packages designed to determine truth trajectories and benchmark your autonomous solution.\n\n\n\nWhy use SPAN?\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh Rate Data:\n\nUsers have access to high-rate, smooth solutions, essential for high-speed freeway/highway driving.\n\nAccuracy and Flexibility:\n\nWhen combined with Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) corrections and post-processing, SPAN offers the best possible solution even through tunnels and ultra-challenging urban canyon situations. Flexibility of the system allows for the addition of a wheel sensor and other external inputs to further refine your solution.\n\nHardware Robustness:\n\nInternal logging and multiple communication interfaces allow for customized utilization and flexibility when integrating into test vehicles.\n\nInterference Toolkit\n\nThe Interference Toolkit (ITK) provides the functionality to monitor, quantify and remove those unintentional interference sources that impact receiver performance. ITK has built-in features to pre-survey demonstration sites, scan for possible interference sources within the vehicle and remove interference.\n\nITK includes two main components:\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Spectrum analysis output:\n\nPlot signal levels on the vertical axis over a range of frequencies on the horizontal axis. The spectral analysis tools show how much signal power is being sensed across the different GNSS frequency bands. When an interference signal is present it can be visualized in the spectral analysis plot.\n\n2. Advanced signal processing and digital filtering:\n\nMitigate and remove interference with built-in software, applied signal processing and digital filters. These processing techniques suppress interference, allowing the GNSS signals to track and the receiver to continue to operate normally.\n\nWhy use ITK for Ground Truth?\n\nTo pre-survey demonstration areas to identify and remove possible sources of interference\n\nTo identify interference sources within the vehicle\n\nTo remove interference with built-in filters\n\nWaypoint\xc2\xae Post-Processing\n\nWaypoint Software provides an ideal solution for applications that require accurate post-mission position, velocity or attitude. Post-processing with Waypoint maximizes the accuracy of the ground truth trajectory by processing forward and reverse in time, backsmoothing and combining the results. It provides the ability to assess the solution reliability and accuracy with extensive quality analysis and plotting tools.\n\nWhy use Waypoint for Ground Truth?\n\nIt maximizes accuracy of GNSS+INS test trajectories\n\nIt provides the ability to offset and transform between reference datums\n\nExport profiles are customizable to meet varying needs\n\nReal-time and post-processed quality can be compared\n\nIt is easy to export to Google Earth for test review\n\nGNSS Corrections\n\nGNSS signals, without corrections, provide positioning accuracy of five to ten meters (16-32 feet). Corrections can be generated by a number of sources or methods, and system developers must choose the corrections method that best meets the demands of their application.\n\nCorrections work in combinations with multi-frequency measurements from the GNSS to provide sub-decimeter to centimeter-level accuracy \xe2\x80\x93 depending on the correction source.'
