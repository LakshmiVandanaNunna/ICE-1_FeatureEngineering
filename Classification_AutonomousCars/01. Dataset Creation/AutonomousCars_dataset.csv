Waymo became the first service provider to offer robotaxi rides to the general public in a part of Phoenix, Arizona in 2020, while Tesla has said it will offer subscription-based ""full self-driving"" to private vehicle owners in 2021,[9][10] and Nuro has been allowed to start autonomous commercial delivery operations in California in 2021.[11] In China two publicly accessible trials of robo-taxis have been launched, in 2020 in Shenzhen\'s Pingshan District by Chinese firm AutoX[12] and in 2021 at Shougang Park in Beijing by Baidu, a venue for the 2022 Winter Olympics.[13]\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nExperiments have been conducted on automated driving systems (ADS) since at least the 1920s;[14] trials began in the 1950s. The first semi-automated car was developed in 1977, by Japan\'s Tsukuba Mechanical Engineering Laboratory, which required specially marked streets that were interpreted by two cameras on the vehicle and an analog computer. The vehicle reached speeds up to 30 kilometres per hour (19 mph) with the support of an elevated rail.[15][16]\n\nA landmark autonomous car appeared in the 1980s, with Carnegie Mellon University\'s Navlab[17] and ALV[18][19] projects funded by the United States\' Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) starting in 1984 and Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich\'s EUREKA Prometheus Project in 1987.[20] By 1985, the ALV had demonstrated self-driving speeds on two-lane roads of 31 kilometres per hour (19 mph), with obstacle avoidance added in 1986, and off-road driving in day and nighttime conditions by 1987.[21] A major milestone was achieved in 1995, with CMU\'s NavLab 5 completing the first autonomous coast-to-coast drive of the United States. Of the 2,849 mi (4,585 km) between Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and San Diego, California, 2,797 mi (4,501 km) were autonomous (98.2%), completed with an average speed of 63.8 mph (102.7 km/h).[22][23][24][25] From the 1960s through the second DARPA Grand Challenge in 2005, automated vehicle research in the United States was primarily funded by DARPA, the US Army, and the US Navy, yielding incremental advances in speeds, driving competence in more complex conditions, controls, and sensor systems.[26] Companies and research organizations have developed prototypes.[20][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34]\n\nThe US allocated US$650 million in 1991 for research on the National Automated Highway System, which demonstrated automated driving through a combination of automation embedded in the highway with automated technology in vehicles, and cooperative networking between the vehicles and with the highway infrastructure. The program concluded with a successful demonstration in 1997 but without clear direction or funding to implement the system on a larger scale.[35] Partly funded by the National Automated Highway System and DARPA, the Carnegie Mellon University Navlab drove 4,584 kilometres (2,848 mi) across America in 1995, 4,501 kilometres (2,797 mi) or 98% of it autonomously.[36] Navlab\'s record achievement stood unmatched for two decades until 2015, when Delphi improved it by piloting an Audi, augmented with Delphi technology, over 5,472 kilometres (3,400 mi) through 15 states while remaining in self-driving mode 99% of the time.[37] In 2015, the US states of Nevada, Florida, California, Virginia, and Michigan, together with Washington, DC, allowed the testing of automated cars on public roads.[38]\n\nFrom 2016 to 2018, the European Commission funded an innovation strategy development for connected and automated driving through the Coordination Actions CARTRE and SCOUT.[39] Moreover, the Strategic Transport Research and Innovation Agenda (STRIA) Roadmap for Connected and Automated Transport was published in 2019.[40]\n\nIn November 2017, Waymo announced that it had begun testing driverless cars without a safety driver in the driver position;[41] however, there was still an employee in the car.[42] An October 2017 report by the Brookings Institute found that the $80 billion had been reported as invested in all facets of self driving technology up to that point, but that it was ""reasonable to presume that total global investment in autonomous vehicle technology is significantly more than this.""[43]\n\nIn October 2018, Waymo announced that its test vehicles had traveled in automated mode for over 10,000,000 miles (16,000,000 km), increasing by about 1,000,000 miles (1,600,000 kilometres) per month.[44] In December 2018, Waymo was the first to commercialize a fully autonomous taxi service in the US, in Phoenix, Arizona.[45] In October 2020, Waymo launched a geo-fenced driverless ride hailing service in Phoenix.[46][47] The cars are being monitored in real-time by a team of remote engineers, and there are cases where the remote engineers need to intervene.[48][47]\n\nIn March 2019, ahead of the autonomous racing series Roborace, Robocar set the Guinness World Record for being the fastest autonomous car in the world. In pushing the limits of self-driving vehicles, Robocar reached 282.42 km/h (175.49 mph) \xe2\x80\x93 an average confirmed by the UK Timing Association at Elvington in Yorkshire, UK.[49]\n\nIn 2020, a National Transportation Safety Board chairman stated that no self-driving cars (SAE level 3+) were available for consumers to purchase in the US in 2020:\n\nThere is not a vehicle currently available to US consumers that is self-driving. Period. Every vehicle sold to US consumers still requires the driver to be actively engaged in the driving task, even when advanced driver assistance systems are activated. If you are selling a car with an advanced driver assistance system, you\xe2\x80\x99re not selling a self-driving car. If you are driving a car with an advanced driver assistance system, you don\xe2\x80\x99t own a self-driving car.[50]\n\nOn 5 March 2021, Honda began leasing in Japan a limited edition of 100 Legend Hybrid EX sedans equipped with the newly approved Level 3 automated driving equipment which had been granted the safety certification by Japanese government to their autonomous ""Traffic Jam Pilot"" driving technology, and legally allow drivers to take their eyes off the road.[51][52][53][54]\n\nDefinitions and classifications [ edit ]\n\nThere is some inconsistency in the terminology used in the self-driving car industry. Various organizations have proposed to define an accurate and consistent vocabulary.\n\nIn 2014, such confusion has been documented in SAE J3016 which states that ""some vernacular usages associate autonomous specifically with full driving automation (Level 5), while other usages apply it to all levels of driving automation, and some state legislation has defined it to correspond approximately to any ADS [automated driving system] at or above Level 3 (or to any vehicle equipped with such an ADS).""\n\nTerminology and safety considerations [ edit ]\n\nModern vehicles provide features such as keeping the car within its lane, speed controls, or emergency braking. Those features alone are just considered as driver assistance technologies because they still require a human driver control while fully automated vehicles drive themselves without human driver input.\n\nAccording to Fortune, some newer vehicles\' technology names\xe2\x80\x94such as AutonoDrive, PilotAssist, Full-Self Driving or DrivePilot\xe2\x80\x94might confuse the driver, who may believe no driver input is expected when in fact the driver needs to remain involved in the driving task.[55] According to the BBC, confusion between those concepts leads to deaths.[56]\n\nFor this reason, some organizations such as the AAA try to provide standardized naming conventions for features such as ALKS which aim to have capacity to manage the driving task, but which are not yet approved to be an automated vehicles in any countries. The Association of British Insurers considers the usage of the word autonomous in marketing for modern cars to be dangerous because car ads make motorists think \'autonomous\' and \'autopilot\' mean a vehicle can drive itself when they still rely on the driver to ensure safety. Technology alone still is not able to drive the car.\n\nSome car makers suggest or claim vehicles are self-driving when they are not able to manage some driving situations. Despite being called Full Self-Driving, Tesla stated that its offering should not be considered as a fully autonomous driving system.[57] This makes drivers risk becoming excessively confident, taking distracted driving behavior, leading to crashes. While in Great-Britain, a fully self-driving car is only a car registered in a specific list.[58] There have also been proposals to adopt the aviation automation safety knowledge into the discussions of safe implementation of autonomous vehicles, due to the experience that has been gained over the decades by the aviation sector on safety topics. [59]\n\nAutonomous vs. automated [ edit ]\n\nAutonomous means self-governing.[60] Many historical projects related to vehicle automation have been automated (made automatic) subject to a heavy reliance on artificial aids in their environment, such as magnetic strips. Autonomous control implies satisfactory performance under significant uncertainties in the environment, and the ability to compensate for system failures without external intervention.[60]\n\nOne approach is to implement communication networks both in the immediate vicinity (for collision avoidance) and farther away (for congestion management). Such outside influences in the decision process reduce an individual vehicle\'s autonomy, while still not requiring human intervention.\n\nWood et al. (2012) wrote, ""This Article generally uses the term \'autonomous,\' instead of the term \'automated.\' "" The term ""autonomous"" was chosen ""because it is the term that is currently in more widespread use (and thus is more familiar to the general public). However, the latter term is arguably more accurate. \'Automated\' connotes control or operation by a machine, while \'autonomous\' connotes acting alone or independently. Most of the vehicle concepts (that we are currently aware of) have a person in the driver\'s seat, utilize a communication connection to the Cloud or other vehicles, and do not independently select either destinations or routes for reaching them. Thus, the term \'automated\' would more accurately describe these vehicle concepts.""[61]\n\nAs of 2017, most commercial projects focused on automated vehicles that did not communicate with other vehicles or with an enveloping management regime. EuroNCAP defines autonomous in ""Autonomous Emergency Braking"" as: ""the system acts independently of the driver to avoid or mitigate the accident."" which implies the autonomous system is not the driver.[62]\n\nIn Europe, the words automated and autonomous might also be used together. For instance, Regulation (EU) 2019/2144 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2019 on type-approval requirements for motor vehicles (...) defines ""automated vehicle"" and ""fully automated vehicle"" based on their autonomous capacity:[63]\n\n""automated vehicle"" means a motor vehicle designed and constructed to move autonomously for certain periods of time without continuous driver supervision but in respect of which driver intervention is still expected or required; [63]\n\n""fully automated vehicle"" means a motor vehicle that has been designed and constructed to move autonomously without any driver supervision;[63]\n\nIn British English, the word automated alone might have several meaning, such in the sentence: ""Thatcham also found that the automated lane keeping systems could only meet two out of the twelve principles required to guarantee safety, going on to say they cannot, therefore, be classed as \xe2\x80\x98automated driving\xe2\x80\x99, instead it claims the tech should be classed as \xe2\x80\x98assisted driving\xe2\x80\x99."":[64] The first occurrence of the ""automated"" word refers to an Unece automated system, while the second occurrence refers to the British legal definition of an automated vehicle. The British law interprets the meaning of ""automated vehicle"" based on the interpretation section related to a vehicle ""driving itself"" and an insured vehicle.[65]\n\nAutonomous versus cooperative [ edit ]\n\nTo enable a car to travel without any driver embedded within the vehicle, some companies use a remote driver.[66]\n\nAccording to SAE J3016,\n\nSome driving automation systems may indeed be autonomous if they perform all of their functions independently and self-sufficiently, but if they depend on communication and/or cooperation with outside entities, they should be considered cooperative rather than autonomous.\n\nClassifications [ edit ]\n\nSelf-driving car [ edit ]\n\nPC Magazine defines a self-driving car as ""a computer-controlled car that drives itself.""[67] The Union of Concerned Scientists states that self-driving cars are ""cars or trucks in which human drivers are never required to take control to safely operate the vehicle. Also known as autonomous or \'driverless\' cars, they combine sensors and software to control, navigate, and drive the vehicle.""[68]\n\nThe British Automated and Electric Vehicles Act 2018 law defines considers a vehicle as ""driving itself"" if the vehicle ""is operating in a mode in which it is not being controlled, and does not need to be monitored, by an individual"".[69]\n\nSAE Classification [ edit ]\n\nA classification system with six levels \xe2\x80\x93 ranging from fully manual to fully automated systems \xe2\x80\x93 was published in 2014 by automotive standardization body SAE International (formerly the Society of Automotive Engineers) as J3016, Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to On-Road Motor Vehicle Automated Driving Systems.[72][73] This classification is based on the amount of driver intervention and attentiveness required, rather than the vehicle\'s capabilities, although these are loosely related. In the United States in 2013, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) released a formal classification system,[74] but abandoned it in favor of the SAE standard in 2016. Also in 2016, SAE updated its classification, called J3016_201609.[75]\n\nLevels of driving automation [ edit ]\n\nIn SAE\'s automation level definitions, ""driving mode"" means ""a type of driving scenario with characteristic dynamic driving task requirements (e.g., expressway merging, high speed cruising, low speed traffic jam, closed-campus operations, etc.)""[1][76]\n\nLevel 0: The automated system issues warnings and may momentarily intervene but has no sustained vehicle control.\n\nLevel 1 (""hands on""): The driver and the automated system share control of the vehicle. Examples are systems where the driver controls steering and the automated system controls engine power to maintain a set speed (Cruise Control) or engine and brake power to maintain and vary speed (Adaptive Cruise Control or ACC); and Parking Assistance, where steering is automated while speed is under manual control. The driver must be ready to retake full control at any time. Lane Keeping Assistance (LKA) Type II is a further example of Level 1 self-driving. Automatic emergency braking which alerts the driver to a crash and permits full braking capacity is also a Level 1 feature, according to Autopilot Review magazine. [77]\n\nmagazine. Level 2 (""hands off""): The automated system takes full control of the vehicle: accelerating, braking, and steering. The driver must monitor the driving and be prepared to intervene immediately at any time if the automated system fails to respond properly. The shorthand ""hands off"" is not meant to be taken literally \xe2\x80\x93 contact between hand and wheel is often mandatory during SAE 2 driving, to confirm that the driver is ready to intervene. The eyes of the driver might be monitored by cameras to confirm that the driver is keeping their attention to traffic. Literal hands off driving is considered level 2.5, although there is no half levels officially. A common example is adaptive cruise control which also utilizes lane keeping assist technology so that the driver simply monitors the vehicle, such as ""Super-Cruise"" in the Cadillac CT6 by General Motors or Ford\'s F-150 BlueCruise. [78]\n\nLevel 3 (""eyes off""): The driver can safely turn their attention away from the driving tasks, e.g. the driver can text or watch a movie. The vehicle will handle situations that call for an immediate response, like emergency braking. The driver must still be prepared to intervene within some limited time, specified by the manufacturer, when called upon by the vehicle to do so. You can think of the automated system as a co-driver that will alert you in an orderly fashion when it is your turn to drive. An example would be a Traffic Jam Chauffeur, [79] another example would be a car satisfying the international Automated Lane Keeping System (ALKS) regulations. [80]\n\nanother example would be a car satisfying the international Automated Lane Keeping System (ALKS) regulations. Level 4 (""mind off""): As level 3, but no driver attention is ever required for safety, e.g. the driver may safely go to sleep or leave the driver\'s seat. However, self-driving is supported only in limited spatial areas (geofenced) or under special circumstances. Outside of these areas or circumstances, the vehicle must be able to safely abort the trip, e.g. slow down and park the car, if the driver does not retake control. An example would be a robotic taxi or a robotic delivery service that covers selected locations in an area, at a specific time and quantities.\n\nLevel 5 (""steering wheel optional""): No human intervention is required at all. An example would be a robotic vehicle that works on all kinds of surfaces, all over the world, all year around, in all weather conditions.\n\nIn the formal SAE definition below, an important transition is from SAE Level 2 to SAE Level 3 in which the human driver is no longer expected to monitor the environment continuously. At SAE 3, the human driver still has responsibility to intervene when asked to do so by the automated system. At SAE 4 the human driver is always relieved of that responsibility and at SAE 5 the automated system will never need to ask for an intervention.\n\nSAE (J3016) Automation Levels[76] SAE Level Name Narrative definition Execution of\n\nsteering and\n\nacceleration/\n\ndeceleration Monitoring of driving environment Fallback performance of dynamic driving task System capability (driving modes) Human driver monitors the driving environment 0 No Automation The full-time performance by the human driver of all aspects of the dynamic driving task, even when ""enhanced by warning or intervention systems"" Human driver Human driver Human driver n/a 1 Driver Assistance The driving mode-specific execution by a driver assistance system of ""either steering or acceleration/deceleration"" using information about the driving environment and with the expectation that the human driver performs all remaining aspects of the dynamic driving task Human driver and system Some driving modes 2 Partial Automation The driving mode-specific execution by one or more driver assistance systems of both steering and acceleration/deceleration System Automated driving system monitors the driving environment 3 Conditional Automation The driving mode-specific performance by an automated driving system of all aspects of the dynamic driving task with the expectation that the human driver will respond appropriately to a request to intervene System System Human driver Some driving modes 4 High Automation even if a human driver does not respond appropriately to a request to intervene the car can pull over safely by guiding system System Many driving modes 5 Full Automation under all roadway and environmental conditions that can be managed by a human driver All driving modes\n\nCriticism of SAE [ edit ]\n\nThe SAE Automation Levels have been criticized for their technological focus. It has been argued that the structure of the levels suggests that automation increases linearly and that more automation is better, which may not always be the case.[81] The SAE Levels also do not account for changes that may be required to infrastructure[82] and road user behavior.[83][84]\n\nTechnology [ edit ]\n\nThe characteristics of autonomous vehicles, as digital technology, are distinguishable from other types of technologies and vehicles. These characteristics mean autonomous vehicles are able to be more transformative and agile to possible changes. The characteristics include hybrid navigation, homogenization and decoupling, vehicle communication systems, reprogrammable and smart, digital traces and modularity.\n\nHybrid navigation [ edit ]\n\nThere are different systems that help the self-driving car control the car, including the car navigation system, the location system, the electronic map, the map matching, the global path planning, the environment perception, the laser perception, the radar perception, the visual perception, the vehicle control, the perception of vehicle speed and direction, and the vehicle control method.[85]\n\nDriverless car designers are challenged with producing control systems capable of analyzing sensory data in order to provide accurate detection of other vehicles and the road ahead.[86] Modern self-driving cars generally use Bayesian simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms,[87] which fuse data from multiple sensors and an off-line map into current location estimates and map updates. Waymo has developed a variant of SLAM with detection and tracking of other moving objects (DATMO), which also handles obstacles such as cars and pedestrians. Simpler systems may use roadside real-time locating system (RTLS) technologies to aid localization. Typical sensors include lidar (Light Detection and Ranging), stereo vision, GPS and IMU.[88][89] Control systems on automated cars may use Sensor Fusion, which is an approach that integrates information from a variety of sensors on the car to produce a more consistent, accurate, and useful view of the environment.[90] Heavy rainfall, hail, or snow could impede the car sensors.[citation needed]\n\nDriverless vehicles require some form of machine vision for the purpose of visual object recognition. Automated cars are being developed with deep neural networks,[88] a type of deep learning architecture with many computational stages, or levels, in which neurons are simulated from the environment that activate the network.[91] The neural network depends on an extensive amount of data extracted from real-life driving scenarios,[88] enabling the neural network to ""learn"" how to execute the best course of action.[91]\n\nIn May 2018, researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology announced that they had built an automated car that can navigate unmapped roads.[92] Researchers at their Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) have developed a new system, called MapLite, which allows self-driving cars to drive on roads that they have never been on before, without using 3D maps. The system combines the GPS position of the vehicle, a ""sparse topological map"" such as OpenStreetMap, (i.e. having 2D features of the roads only), and a series of sensors that observe the road conditions.[93]\n\nHomogenization and decoupling [ edit ]\n\nHomogenization indicates the fact that all digital information assumes the same form. During the ongoing evolution of the digital era, certain industry standards have been developed on how to store digital information and in what type of format. This concept of homogenization also applies to autonomous vehicles. In order for autonomous vehicles to perceive their surroundings, they have to use different techniques each with their own accompanying digital information (e.g. radar, GPS, motion sensors and computer vision). Homogenization requires that the digital information from these different sources is transmitted and stored in the same form. This means their differences are decoupled, and digital information can be transmitted, stored, and computed in a way that the vehicles and their operating system can better understand and act upon it. Homogenization also helps to take advantage of the exponential increase of the computing power of hardware and software (Moore\'s law) which also supports the autonomous vehicles to understand and act upon the digital information in a more cost-effective way, therefore lowering the marginal costs.[citation needed]\n\nVehicle communication systems [ edit ]\n\nIndividual vehicles can benefit from information obtained from other vehicles in the vicinity, especially information relating to traffic congestion and safety hazards. Vehicular communication systems use vehicles and roadside units as the communicating nodes in a peer-to-peer network, providing each other with information. As a cooperative approach, vehicular communication systems can allow all cooperating vehicles to be more effective. According to a 2010 study by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, vehicular communication systems could help avoid up to 79% of all traffic accidents.[94]\n\nThere have so far been no complete implementation of peer-to-peer networking on the scale required for traffic.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2012, computer scientists at the University of Texas in Austin began developing smart intersections designed for automated cars. The intersections will have no traffic lights and no stop signs, instead using computer programs that will communicate directly with each car on the road.[95] In the case of autonomous vehicles, it is essential for them to connect with other \'devices\' in order to function most effectively. Autonomous vehicles are equipped with communication systems which allow them to communicate with other autonomous vehicles and roadside units to provide them, amongst other things, with information about road work or traffic congestion. In addition, scientists believe that the future will have computer programs that connect and manage each individual autonomous vehicle as it navigates through an intersection. This type of connectivity must replace traffic lights and stop signs.[95] These types of characteristics drive and further develop the ability of autonomous vehicles to understand and cooperate with other products and services (such as intersection computer systems) in the autonomous vehicles market. This could lead to a network of autonomous vehicles all using the same network and information available on that network. Eventually, this can lead to more autonomous vehicles using the network because the information has been validated through the usage of other autonomous vehicles. Such movements will strengthen the value of the network and is called network externalities.\n\nAmong connected cars, an unconnected one is the weakest and will be increasingly banned from busy high-speed roads, as predicted by the Helsinki think tank, Nordic Communications Corporation, in January 2016.[96]\n\nIn 2017, Researchers from Arizona State University developed a 1/10 scale intersection and proposed an intersection management technique called Crossroads. It was shown that Crossroads is very resilient to network delay of both V2I communication and Worst-case Execution time of the intersection manager.[97] In 2018, a robust approach was introduced which is resilient to both model mismatch and external disturbances such as wind and bumps.[98]\n\nVehicle networking may be desirable due to difficulty with computer vision being able to recognize brake lights, turn signals, buses, and similar things. However, the usefulness of such systems would be diminished by the fact current cars are not equipped with them; they may also pose privacy concerns.[99]\n\nReprogrammable [ edit ]\n\nAnother characteristic of autonomous vehicles is that the core product will have a greater emphasis on the software and its possibilities, instead of the chassis and its engine. This is because autonomous vehicles have software systems that drive the vehicle, meaning that updates through reprogramming or editing the software can enhance the benefits of the owner (e.g. update in better distinguishing blind person vs. non-blind person so that the vehicle will take extra caution when approaching a blind person). A characteristic of this reprogrammable part of autonomous vehicles is that the updates need not only to come from the supplier, because through machine learning, smart autonomous vehicles can generate certain updates and install them accordingly (e.g. new navigation maps or new intersection computer systems). These reprogrammable characteristics of the digital technology and the possibility of smart machine learning give manufacturers of autonomous vehicles the opportunity to differentiate themselves on software. This also implies that autonomous vehicles are never finished because the product can continuously be improved.[citation needed]\n\nDigital traces [ edit ]\n\nAutonomous vehicles are equipped with different sorts of sensors and radars. As said, this allows them to connect and interoperate with computers from other autonomous vehicles and/or roadside units. This implies that autonomous vehicles leave digital traces when they connect or interoperate. The data that comes from these digital traces can be used to develop new (to be determined) products or updates to enhance autonomous vehicles\' driving ability or safety.[citation needed]\n\nModularity [ edit ]\n\nTraditional vehicles and their accompanying technologies are manufactured as a product that will be complete, and unlike autonomous vehicles, they can only be improved if they are redesigned or reproduced. As said, autonomous vehicles are produced but due to their digital characteristics never finished. This is because autonomous vehicles are more modular since they are made up out of several modules which will be explained hereafter through a Layered Modular Architecture. The Layered Modular Architecture extends the architecture of purely physical vehicles by incorporating four loosely coupled layers of devices, networks, services and contents into Autonomous Vehicles. These loosely coupled layers can interact through certain standardized interfaces.\n\n(1) The first layer of this architecture consists of the device layer. This layer consists of the following two parts: logical capability and physical machinery. The physical machinery refers to the actual vehicle itself (e.g. chassis and carrosserie). When it comes to digital technologies, the physical machinery is accompanied by a logical capability layer in the form of operating systems that helps to guide the vehicles itself and make it autonomous. The logical capability provides control over the vehicle and connects it with the other layers.;\n\n(2) On top of the device layer comes the network layer. This layer also consists of two different parts: physical transport and logical transmission. The physical transport layer refers to the radars, sensors and cables of the autonomous vehicles which enable the transmission of digital information. Next to that, the network layer of autonomous vehicles also has a logical transmission which contains communication protocols and network standard to communicate the digital information with other networks and platforms or between layers. This increases the accessibility of the autonomous vehicles and enables the computational power of a network or platform.;\n\n(3) The service layer contains the applications and their functionalities that serves the autonomous vehicle (and its owners) as they extract, create, store and consume content with regards to their own driving history, traffic congestion, roads or parking abilities for example.; and\n\n(4) The final layer of the model is the contents layer. This layer contains the sounds, images and videos. The autonomous vehicles store, extract and use to act upon and improve their driving and understanding of the environment. The contents layer also provides metadata and directory information about the content\'s origin, ownership, copyright, encoding methods, content tags, geo-time stamps, and so on (Yoo et al., 2010).\n\nThe consequence of layered modular architecture of autonomous vehicles (and other digital technologies) is that it enables the emergence and development of platforms and ecosystems around a product and/or certain modules of that product. Traditionally, automotive vehicles were developed, manufactured and maintained by traditional manufacturers. Nowadays app developers and content creators can help to develop more comprehensive product experience for the consumers which creates a platform around the product of autonomous vehicles.\n\nChallenges [ edit ]\n\nThe potential benefits from increased vehicle automation described may be limited by foreseeable challenges such as disputes over liability,[100][101] the time needed to turn over the existing stock of vehicles from non-automated to automated,[102] and thus a long period of humans and autonomous vehicles sharing the roads, resistance by individuals to forfeiting control of their cars,[103] concerns about safety,[104] and the implementation of a legal framework and consistent global government regulations for self-driving cars.[105]\n\nOther obstacles could include de-skilling and lower levels of driver experience for dealing with potentially dangerous situations and anomalies,[106] ethical problems where an automated vehicle\'s software is forced during an unavoidable crash to choose between multiple harmful courses of action (\'the trolley problem\'),[107][108] concerns about making large numbers of people currently employed as drivers unemployed, the potential for more intrusive mass surveillance of location, association and travel as a result of police and intelligence agency access to large data sets generated by sensors and pattern-recognition AI, and possibly insufficient understanding of verbal sounds, gestures and non-verbal cues by police, other drivers or pedestrians.[109]\n\nAutonomous delivery vehicles stuck in one place by attempting to avoid one another.\n\nPossible technological obstacles for automated cars are:\n\nArtificial Intelligence is still not able to function properly in chaotic inner-city environments. [110]\n\nA car\'s computer could potentially be compromised, as could a communication system between cars. [111] [112] [113] [114] [115]\n\nSusceptibility of the car\'s sensing and navigation systems to different types of weather (such as snow) or deliberate interference, including jamming and spoofing. [109]\n\nAvoidance of large animals requires recognition and tracking, and Volvo found that software suited to caribou, deer, and elk was ineffective with kangaroos. [116]\n\nAutonomous cars may require high-definition maps to operate properly. Where these maps may be out of date, they would need to be able to fall back to reasonable behaviors.\n\nCompetition for the radio spectrum desired for the car\'s communication. [117]\n\nField programmability for the systems will require careful evaluation of product development and the component supply chain. [115]\n\nCurrent road infrastructure may need changes for automated cars to function optimally. [118]\n\nValidation challenge of Automated Driving and need for novel simulation-based approaches comprising digital twins and agent-based traffic simulation.[119]\n\nSocial challenges include:\n\nUncertainty about potential future regulation may delay deployment of automated cars on the road. [120]\n\nEmployment \xe2\x80\x93 Companies working on the technology have an increasing recruitment problem in that the available talent pool has not grown with demand.[121] As such, education and training by third-party organizations such as providers of online courses and self-taught community-driven projects such as DIY Robocars[122] and Formula Pi have quickly grown in popularity, while university level extra-curricular programmes such as Formula Student Driverless[123] have bolstered graduate experience. Industry is steadily increasing freely available information sources, such as code,[124] datasets[125] and glossaries[126] to widen the recruitment pool.\n\nHuman factor [ edit ]\n\nSelf-driving cars are already exploring the difficulties of determining the intentions of pedestrians, bicyclists, and animals, and models of behavior must be programmed into driving algorithms.[8] Human road users also have the challenge of determining the intentions of autonomous vehicles, where there is no driver with which to make eye contact or exchange hand signals. Drive.ai is testing a solution to this problem that involves LED signs mounted on the outside of the vehicle, announcing status such as ""going now, don\'t cross"" vs. ""waiting for you to cross"".[127]\n\nTwo human-factor challenges are important for safety. One is the handoff from automated driving to manual driving, which may become necessary due to unfavorable or unusual road conditions, or if the vehicle has limited capabilities. A sudden handoff could leave a human driver dangerously unprepared in the moment. In the long term, humans who have less practice at driving might have a lower skill level and thus be more dangerous in manual mode. The second challenge is known as risk compensation: as a system is perceived to be safer, instead of benefiting entirely from all of the increased safety, people engage in riskier behavior and enjoy other benefits. Semi-automated cars have been shown to suffer from this problem, for example with users of Tesla Autopilot ignoring the road and using electronic devices or other activities against the advice of the company that the car is not capable of being completely autonomous. In the near future, pedestrians and bicyclists may travel in the street in a riskier fashion if they believe self-driving cars are capable of avoiding them.\n\nIn order for people to buy self-driving cars and vote for the government to allow them on roads, the technology must be trusted as safe.[128][129] Self-driving elevators were invented in 1900, but the high number of people refusing to use them slowed adoption for several decades until operator strikes increased demand and trust was built with advertising and features like the emergency stop button.[130][131] There are three types of trust between human and automation.[132] There is dispositional trust, the trust between the driver and the company\'s product.[132] Situational trust, or the trust from different scenarios.[132] Finally there is learned trust where the trust is built between similar events.[132]\n\nMoral issues [ edit ]\n\nWith the emergence of automated automobiles, various ethical issues arise. While the introduction of automated vehicles to the mass market is said to be inevitable due to a presumed but untestable potential for reduction of crashes by ""up to"" 90%[133] and their potential greater accessibility to disabled, elderly, and young passengers, a range of ethical issues have been posed. Those include, but are not limited to:\n\nThe moral, financial, and criminal responsibility for crashes and breaches of law\n\nThe decisions a car is to make right before a potentially fatal crash\n\nPrivacy issues, including the potential for mass surveillance\n\nPotential for massive job losses and unemployment among drivers\n\nDe-skilling and loss of independence by vehicle users\n\nExposure to hacking and malware\n\nThe further concentration of market and data power in the hands of a few global conglomerates capable of consolidating AI capacity and of lobbying governments to facilitate the shift of liability onto others and their potential destruction of existing occupations and industries.\n\nThere are different opinions on who should be held liable in case of a crash, especially with people being hurt. Many experts see the car manufacturers themselves being responsible for those crashes that occur due to a technical malfunction or misconstruction.[134] Besides the fact that the car manufacturer would be the source of the problem in a situation where a car crashes due to a technical issue, there is another important reason why car manufacturers could be held responsible: it would encourage them to innovate and heavily invest into fixing those issues, not only due to protection of the brand image, but also due to financial and criminal consequences. However, there are also voices[who?] that argue those using or owning the vehicle should be held responsible since they know the risks involved in using such a vehicle. One study suggests requesting the owners of self-driving cars to sign end-user license agreements (EULAs), assigning to them accountability for any accidents.[135] Other studies suggest introducing a tax or insurances that would protect owners and users of automated vehicles of claims made by victims of an accident.[134] Other possible parties that can be held responsible in case of a technical failure include software engineers that programmed the code for the automated operation of the vehicles, and suppliers of components of the AV.[136]\n\nTaking aside the question of legal liability and moral responsibility, the question arises how automated vehicles should be programmed to behave in an emergency situation where either passengers or other traffic participants like pedestrians, bicyclists and other drivers are endangered. A moral dilemma that a software engineer or car manufacturer might face in programming the operating software is described in an ethical thought experiment, the trolley problem: a conductor of a trolley has the choice of staying on the planned track and running over five people, or turn the trolley onto a track where it would kill only one person, assuming there is no traffic on it.[137] When a self-driving car is in following scenario: it\'s driving with passengers and suddenly a person appears in its way. The car has to decide between the two options, either to run the person over or to avoid hitting the person by swerving into a wall, killing the passengers.[138] There are two main considerations that need to be addressed. First, what moral basis would be used by an automated vehicle to make decisions? Second, how could those be translated into software code? Researchers have suggested, in particular, two ethical theories to be applicable to the behavior of automated vehicles in cases of emergency: deontology and utilitarianism.[8][139] Asimov\'s Three Laws of Robotics are a typical example of deontological ethics. The theory suggests that an automated car needs to follow strict written-out rules that it needs to follow in any situation. Utilitarianism suggests the idea that any decision must be made based on the goal to maximize utility. This needs a definition of utility which could be maximizing the number of people surviving in a crash. Critics suggest that automated vehicles should adapt a mix of multiple theories to be able to respond morally right in the instance of a crash.[8][139] Recently, some specific ethical frameworks i.e., utilitarianism, deontology, relativism, absolutism (monism), and pluralism, are investigated empirically with respect to the acceptance of self-driving cars in unavoidable accidents.[140]\n\nMany \'trolley\' discussions skip over the practical problems of how a probabilistic machine learning vehicle AI could be sophisticated enough to understand that a deep problem of moral philosophy is presenting itself from instant to instant while using a dynamic projection into the near future, what sort of moral problem it actually would be if any, what the relevant weightings in human value terms should be given to all the other humans involved who will be probably unreliably identified, and how reliably it can assess the probable outcomes. These practical difficulties, and those around testing and assessment of solutions to them, may present as much of a challenge as the theoretical abstractions.[141]\n\nWhile most trolley conundrums involve hyperbolic and unlikely fact patterns, it is inevitable mundane ethical decisions and risk calculations such as the precise millisecond a car should yield to a yellow light or how closely to drive to a bike lane will need to be programmed into the software of autonomous vehicles.[8][142] Mundane ethical situations may even be more relevant than rare fatal circumstances because of the specificity implicated and their large scope.[142] Mundane situations involving drivers and pedestrians are so prevalent that, in the aggregate, produce large amounts of injuries and deaths.[142] Hence, even incremental permutations of moral algorithms can have a notable effect when considered in their entirety.[142]\n\nPrivacy-related issues arise mainly from the interconnectivity of automated cars, making it just another mobile device that can gather any information about an individual (see data mining). This information gathering ranges from tracking of the routes taken, voice recording, video recording, preferences in media that is consumed in the car, behavioral patterns, to many more streams of information.[99][143][144] The data and communications infrastructure needed to support these vehicles may also be capable of surveillance, especially if coupled to other data sets and advanced analytics.[99]\n\nThe implementation of automated vehicles to the mass market might cost up to 5 million jobs in the US alone, making up almost 3% of the workforce.[145] Those jobs include drivers of taxis, buses, vans, trucks, and e-hailing vehicles. Many industries, such as the auto insurance industry are indirectly affected. This industry alone generates an annual revenue of about US$220 billion, supporting 277,000 jobs.[146] To put this into perspective\xe2\x80\x93this is about the number of mechanical engineering jobs.[147] The potential loss of a majority of those jobs will have a tremendous impact on those individuals involved.[148]\n\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has animated the trolley problem in the context of autonomous cars in a website called The Moral Machine.[149] The Moral Machine generates random scenarios in which autonomous cars malfunction and forces the user to choose between two harmful courses of action.[149] MIT\'s Moral Machine experiment has collected data involving over 40 million decisions from people in 233 countries to ascertain peoples\' moral preferences. The MIT study illuminates that ethical preferences vary among cultures and demographics and likely correlate with modern institutions and geographic traits.[149]\n\nGlobal trends of the MIT study highlight that, overall, people prefer to save the lives of humans over other animals, prioritize the lives of many rather than few, and spare the lives of young rather than old.[149] Men are slightly more likely to spare the lives of women, and religious affiliates are slightly more likely to prioritize human life. The lives of criminals were prioritized more than cats, but the lives of dogs were prioritized more than the lives of criminals.[150] The lives of homeless were spared more than the elderly, but the lives of homeless were spared less often than the obese.[150]\n\nPeople overwhelmingly express a preference for autonomous vehicles to be programmed with utilitarian ideas, that is, in a manner that generates the least harm and minimizes driving casualties.[151] While people want others to purchase utilitarian promoting vehicles, they themselves prefer to ride in vehicles that prioritize the lives of people inside the vehicle at all costs.[151] This presents a paradox in which people prefer that others drive utilitarian vehicles designed to maximize the lives preserved in a fatal situation but want to ride in cars that prioritize the safety of passengers at all costs.[151] People disapprove of regulations that promote utilitarian views and would be less willing to purchase a self-driving car that may opt to promote the greatest good at the expense of its passengers.[151]\n\nBonnefon et al. conclude that the regulation of autonomous vehicle ethical prescriptions may be counterproductive to societal safety.[151] This is because, if the government mandates utilitarian ethics and people prefer to ride in self-protective cars, it could prevent the large scale implementation of self-driving cars.[151] Delaying the adoption of autonomous cars vitiates the safety of society as a whole because this technology is projected to save so many lives.[151] This is a paradigmatic example of the tragedy of the commons, in which rational actors cater to their self-interested preferences at the expense of societal utility.[152]\n\nTesting [ edit ]\n\nTo make a car 95% as safe as an experienced driver, 275 million failure-free autonomous miles (400 M km) are needed while several billions miles (or kilometers) are needed to make them 10% or 20% safer than humans.[153]\n\nThe testing of vehicles with varying degrees of automation can be carried out either physically, in a closed environment[154] or, where permitted, on public roads (typically requiring a license or permit,[155] or adhering to a specific set of operating principles),[156] or in a virtual environment, i.e. using computer simulations.[157][158] When driven on public roads, automated vehicles require a person to monitor their proper operation and ""take over"" when needed. For example, New York state has strict requirements for the test driver, such that the vehicle can be corrected at all times by a licensed operator; highlighted by Cardian Cube Company\'s application and discussions with New York State officials and the NYS DMV.[159]\n\nApple is testing self-driving cars, and has increased its fleet of test vehicles from three in April 2017, to 27 in January 2018, and 45 by March 2018.[160][161]\n\nRussian internet-company Yandex started to develop self-driving cars in early 2017. The first driverless prototype was launched in May 2017. In November 2017, Yandex released a video of its AV winter tests.[162] The car drove successfully along snowy roads of Moscow. In June 2018, Yandex self-driving vehicle completed a 485-mile (780 km) trip on a federal highway from Moscow to Kazan in autonomous mode.[163][164] In August 2018, Yandex launched a Europe\'s first robotaxi service with no human driver behind the wheel in the Russian town of Innopolis.[165] At the beginning of 2020 it was reported that over 5,000 autonomous passenger rides were made in the city.[166] At the end of 2018, Yandex obtained a license to operate autonomous vehicles on public roads in the U.S. state of Nevada. In 2019 and 2020, Yandex cars carried out demo rides for Consumer Electronic Show visitors in Las Vegas. Yandex cars were circulating the streets of the city without any human control.[167][168] In 2019 Yandex started testing its self-driving cars on the public roads of Israel.[169] In October 2019, Yandex became one of the companies selected by Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) to provide autonomous passenger rides to the visitors of Detroit Autoshow 2020.[170] At the end of 2019, Yandex made an announcement its self-driving cars passed 1 million miles in fully autonomous mode in Russia, Israel, and the United States.[171] In February 2020, Yandex doubled its mileage with 2 million miles passed.[172] In 2020, Yandex started to test its self-driving cars in Michigan.[173]\n\nThe progress of automated vehicles can be assessed by computing the average distance driven between ""disengagements"", when the automated system is switched off, typically by the intervention of a human driver. In 2017, Waymo reported 63 disengagements over 352,545 mi (567,366 km) of testing, an average distance of 5,596 mi (9,006 km) between disengagements, the highest among companies reporting such figures. Waymo also traveled a greater total distance than any of the other companies. Their 2017 rate of 0.18 disengagements per 1,000 mi (1,600 km) was an improvement over the 0.2 disengagements per 1,000 mi (1,600 km) in 2016, and 0.8 in 2015. In March 2017, Uber reported an average of just 0.67 mi (1.08 km) per disengagement. In the final three months of 2017, Cruise (now owned by GM) averaged 5,224 mi (8,407 km) per disengagement over a total distance of 62,689 mi (100,888 km).[174] In July 2018, the first electric driverless racing car, ""Robocar"", completed a 1.8-kilometer track, using its navigation system and artificial intelligence.[175]\n\nDistance between disengagement and total distance traveled autonomously Car maker California, 2016[174] California, 2018[176] California, 2019[177] Distance between\n\ndisengagements Total distance traveled Distance between\n\ndisengagements Total distance traveled Distance between\n\ndisengagements Total distance traveled Waymo 5,128 mi (8,253 km) 635,868 mi (1,023,330 km) 11,154 mi (17,951 km) 1,271,587 mi (2,046,421 km) 11,017 mi (17,730 km) 1,450,000 mi (2,330,000 km) BMW 638 mi (1,027 km) 638 mi (1,027 km) Nissan 263 mi (423 km) 6,056 mi (9,746 km) 210 mi (340 km) 5,473 mi (8,808 km) Ford 197 mi (317 km) 590 mi (950 km) General Motors 55 mi (89 km) 8,156 mi (13,126 km) 5,205 mi (8,377 km) 447,621 mi (720,376 km) 12,221 mi (19,668 km) 831,040 mi (1,337,430 km) Delphi Automotive Systems 15 mi (24 km) 2,658 mi (4,278 km) Tesla 3 mi (4.8 km) 550 mi (890 km) Mercedes-Benz 2 mi (3.2 km) 673 mi (1,083 km) 1.5 mi (2.4 km) 1,749 mi (2,815 km) Bosch 7 mi (11 km) 983 mi (1,582 km) Zoox 1,923 mi (3,095 km) 30,764 mi (49,510 km) 1,595 mi (2,567 km) 67,015 mi (107,850 km) Nuro 1,028 mi (1,654 km) 24,680 mi (39,720 km) 2,022 mi (3,254 km) 68,762 mi (110,662 km) Pony.ai 1,022 mi (1,645 km) 16,356 mi (26,322 km) 6,476 mi (10,422 km) 174,845 mi (281,386 km) Baidu (Apolong) 206 mi (332 km) 18,093 mi (29,118 km) 18,050 mi (29,050 km) 108,300 mi (174,300 km) Aurora 100 mi (160 km) 32,858 mi (52,880 km) 280 mi (450 km) 39,729 mi (63,938 km) Apple 1.1 mi (1.8 km) 79,745 mi (128,337 km) 118 mi (190 km) 7,544 mi (12,141 km) Uber 0.4 mi (0.64 km) 26,899 mi (43,290 km) 0 mi (0 km)\n\nApplications [ edit ]\n\nAutonomous trucks and vans [ edit ]\n\nCompanies such as Otto and Starsky Robotics have focused on autonomous trucks. Automation of trucks is important, not only due to the improved safety aspects of these very heavy vehicles, but also due to the ability of fuel savings through platooning. Autonomous vans are being used by online grocers such as Ocado.[citation needed]\n\nResearch has also indicated that goods distribution on the macro (urban distribution) and micro level (last mile delivery) could be made more efficient with the use of autonomous vehicles [178] thanks to the possibility of smaller vehicle sizes.\n\nTransport systems [ edit ]\n\nChina trialed the first automated public bus in Henan province in 2015, on a highway linking Zhengzhou and Kaifeng.[179][180] Baidu and King Long produce automated minibus, a vehicle with 14 seats, but without driving seat. With 100 vehicles produced, 2018 will be the first year with commercial automated service in China.[181][182]\n\nIn Europe, cities in Belgium, France, Italy and the UK are planning to operate transport systems for automated cars,[183][184][185] and Germany, the Netherlands, and Spain have allowed public testing in traffic. In 2015, the UK launched public trials of the LUTZ Pathfinder automated pod in Milton Keynes.[186] Beginning in summer 2015, the French government allowed PSA Peugeot-Citroen to make trials in real conditions in the Paris area. The experiments were planned to be extended to other cities such as Bordeaux and Strasbourg by 2016.[187] The alliance between French companies THALES and Valeo (provider of the first self-parking car system that equips Audi and Mercedes premi) is testing its own system.[188] New Zealand is planning to use automated vehicles for public transport in Tauranga and Christchurch.[189][190][191][192]\n\nImpact [ edit ]\n\nAutomobile industry [ edit ]\n\nThe traditional automobile industry is subject to changes driven by technology and market demands. These changes include breakthrough technological advances and when the market demands and adopts new technology quickly. In the rapid advance of both factors, the end of the era of incremental change was recognized. When the transition is made to new technology, new entrants to the automotive industry present themselves, which can be distinguished as mobility providers such as Uber and Lyft, as well as tech giants such as Google and Nvidia.[193] As new entrants to the industry arise, market uncertainty naturally occurs due to the changing dynamics. For example, the entrance of tech giants, as well as the alliances between them and traditional car manufacturers causes a variation in the innovation and production process of autonomous vehicles. Additionally, the entrance of mobility providers has caused ambiguous user preferences. As a result of the rise of mobility providers, the number of vehicles per capita has flatlined. In addition, the rise of the sharing economy also contributes to market uncertainty and causes forecasters to question whether personal ownership of vehicles is still relevant as new transportation technology and mobility providers are becoming preferred among consumers.\n\nTo help reduce the possibility of safety issues, some companies have begun to open-source parts of their driverless systems. Udacity for instance is developing an open-source software stack,[194] and some companies are having similar approaches.[195][196]\n\nHealth [ edit ]\n\nAccording to a 2020 Annual Review of Public Health review of the literature, self-driving cars ""could increase some health risks (such as air pollution, noise, and sedentarism); however, if properly regulated, AVs will likely reduce morbidity and mortality from motor vehicle crashes and may help reshape cities to promote healthy urban environments.""[197] Driving safety experts predict that once driverless technology has been fully developed, traffic collisions (and resulting deaths and injuries and costs) caused by human error, such as delayed reaction time, tailgating, rubbernecking, and other forms of distracted or aggressive driving should be substantially reduced.[1][198][199][200][201] With the increasing reliance of autonomous vehicles on interconnectivity and the availability of big data which is made usable in the form of real-time maps, driving decisions can be made much faster in order to prevent collisions.[8]\n\nNumbers made available by the US government state that 94% of vehicle accidents are due to human failures.[202] As a result, major implications for the healthcare industry become apparent. Numbers from the National Safety Council on killed and injured people on US roads multiplied by the average costs of a single incident reveal that an estimated US$500 billion loss may be imminent for the US healthcare industry when autonomous vehicles are dominating the roads. It is likely the anticipated decrease in traffic accidents will positively contribute to the widespread acceptance of autonomous vehicles, as well as the possibility to better allocate healthcare resources. If 90% of cars in the US became self-driving, for example, an estimated 25,000 lives would be saved annually. Lives saved by averting automobile crashes in the US has been valued at more than $200 billion annually.[197]\n\nSelf-driving car would have the potential to save 10 million lives worldwide, per decade.[203][197]\n\nAccording to motorist website ""TheDrive.com"" operated by Time magazine, none of the driving safety experts they were able to contact was able to rank driving under an autopilot system at the time (2017) as having achieved a greater level of safety than traditional fully hands-on driving, so the degree to which these benefits asserted by proponents will manifest in practice cannot be assessed.[204] Confounding factors that could reduce the net effect on safety may include unexpected interactions between humans and partly or fully automated vehicles, or between different types of a vehicle system; complications at the boundaries of functionality at each automation level (such as handover when the vehicle reaches the limit of its capacity); the effect of the bugs and flaws that inevitably occur in complex interdependent software systems; sensor or data shortcomings; and successful compromise by malicious interveners. Security problems include what an autonomous car might do if summoned to pick up the owner but another person attempts entry, what happens if someone tries to break into the car, and what happens if someone attacks the occupants, for example by exchanging gunfire.[205]\n\nSome[who?] believe that once automation in vehicles reaches higher levels and becomes reliable, drivers will pay less attention to the road.[206] Research shows that drivers in automated cars react later when they have to intervene in a critical situation, compared to if they were driving manually.[207] Depending on the capabilities of automated vehicles and the frequency with which human intervention is needed, this may counteract any increase in safety, as compared to all-human driving, that may be delivered by other factors.\n\nAn unexpected disadvantage of the widespread acceptance of autonomous vehicles would be a reduction in the supply of organs for donation.[208] In the US, for example, 13% of the organ donation supply comes from car crash victims.[197]\n\nWelfare [ edit ]\n\nAccording to a 2020 study, self-driving cars will increase productivity, and housing affordability, as well as reclaim land used for parking.[209] However, self-driving cars will cause greater energy use, traffic congestion and sprawl.[209] Automated cars could reduce labor costs;[210][211] relieve travelers from driving and navigation chores, thereby replacing behind-the-wheel commuting hours with more time for leisure or work;[198][201] and also would lift constraints on occupant ability to drive, distracted and texting while driving, intoxicated, prone to seizures, or otherwise impaired.[212][213][214]\n\nFor the young, the elderly, people with disabilities, and low-income citizens, automated cars could provide enhanced mobility.[215][216] The removal of the steering wheel\xe2\x80\x94along with the remaining driver interface and the requirement for any occupant to assume a forward-facing position\xe2\x80\x94would give the interior of the cabin greater ergonomic flexibility. Large vehicles, such as motorhomes, would attain appreciably enhanced ease of use.[217]\n\nThe elderly and persons with disabilities (such as persons who are hearing-impaired, vision-impaired, mobility-impaired, or cognitively-impaired) are potential beneficiaries of adoption of autonomous vehicles; however, the extent to which such populations gain greater mobility from the adoption of AV technology depends on the specific designs and regulations adopted.[218][219]\n\nChildren and teens, who are not able to drive a vehicle themselves in case of student transport, would also benefit of the introduction of autonomous cars.[220] Daycares and schools are able to come up with automated pick-up and drop-off systems by car in addition to walking, cycling and busing, causing a decrease of reliance on parents and childcare workers.\n\nThe extent to which human actions are necessary for driving will vanish. Since current vehicles require human actions to some extent, the driving school industry will not be disrupted until the majority of autonomous transportation is switched to the emerged dominant design. It is plausible that in the distant future driving a vehicle will be considered as a luxury, which implies that the structure of the industry is based on new entrants and a new market.[221] Self-driving cars would also exasperate existing mobility inequalities driven by the interests of car companies and technology companies while taking investment away from more equitable and sustainable mobility initiatives such as public transportation.[222]\n\nUrban planning [ edit ]\n\nAccording to a Wonkblog reporter, if fully automated cars become commercially available, they have the potential to be a disruptive innovation with major implications for society. The likelihood of widespread adoption is still unclear, but if they are used on a wide scale, policymakers face a number of unresolved questions about their effects.[118]\n\nOne fundamental question is about their effect on travel behavior. Some people believe that they will increase car ownership and car use because it will become easier to use them and they will ultimately be more useful.[118] This may, in turn, encourage urban sprawl and ultimately total private vehicle use. Others argue that it will be easier to share cars and that this will thus discourage outright ownership and decrease total usage, and make cars more efficient forms of transportation in relation to the present situation.[99][223]\n\nPolicy-makers will have to take a new look at how infrastructure is to be built and how money will be allotted to build for automated vehicles. The need for traffic signals could potentially be reduced with the adoption of smart highways.[224] Due to smart highways and with the assistance of smart technological advances implemented by policy change, the dependence on oil imports may be reduced because of less time being spent on the road by individual cars which could have an effect on policy regarding energy.[225] On the other hand, automated vehicles could increase the overall number of cars on the road which could lead to a greater dependence on oil imports if smart systems are not enough to curtail the impact of more vehicles.[226] However, due to the uncertainty of the future of automated vehicles, policymakers may want to plan effectively by implementing infrastructure improvements that can be beneficial to both human drivers and automated vehicles.[227] Caution needs to be taken in acknowledgment to public transportation and that the use may be greatly reduced if automated vehicles are catered to through policy reform of infrastructure with this resulting in job loss and increased unemployment.[228]\n\nOther disruptive effects will come from the use of automated vehicles to carry goods. Self-driving vans have the potential to make home deliveries significantly cheaper, transforming retail commerce and possibly making hypermarkets and supermarkets redundant. As of 2019 the US Department of Transportation defines automation into six levels, starting at level zero which means the human driver does everything and ending with level five, the automated system performs all the driving tasks. Also under the current law, manufacturers bear all the responsibility to self-certify vehicles for use on public roads. This means that currently as long as the vehicle is compliant within the regulatory framework, there are no specific federal legal barriers in the US to a highly automated vehicle being offered for sale. Iyad Rahwan, an associate professor in the MIT Media Lab said, ""Most people want to live in a world where cars will minimize casualties, but everyone wants their own car to protect them at all costs."" Furthermore, industry standards and best practice are still needed in systems before they can be considered reasonably safe under real-world conditions.[229]\n\nTraffic [ edit ]\n\nAdditional advantages could include higher speed limits;[230] smoother rides;[231] and increased roadway capacity; and minimized traffic congestion, due to decreased need for safety gaps and higher speeds.[232][233] Currently, maximum controlled-access highway throughput or capacity according to the US Highway Capacity Manual is about 2,200 passenger vehicles per hour per lane, with about 5% of the available road space is taken up by cars. One study estimated that automated cars could increase capacity by 273% (\xe2\x89\x888,200 cars per hour per lane). The study also estimated that with 100% connected vehicles using vehicle-to-vehicle communication, capacity could reach 12,000 passenger vehicles per hour (up 545% from 2,200 pc/h per lane) traveling safely at 120 km/h (75 mph) with a following gap of about 6 m (20 ft) of each other. Human drivers at highway speeds keep between 40 to 50 m (130 to 160 ft) away from the vehicle in front. These increases in highway capacity could have a significant impact in traffic congestion, particularly in urban areas, and even effectively end highway congestion in some places.[234] The ability for authorities to manage traffic flow would increase, given the extra data and driving behavior predictability[235] combined with less need for traffic police and even road signage.\n\nInsurance [ edit ]\n\nSafer driving is expected to reduce the costs of vehicle insurance.[210][236][failed verification] The automobile insurance industry might suffer as the technology makes certain aspects of these occupations obsolete.[216] As fewer collisions implicate less money spent on repair costs, the role of the insurance industry is likely to be altered as well. It can be expected that the increased safety of transport due to autonomous vehicles will lead to a decrease in payouts for the insurers, which is positive for the industry, but fewer payouts may imply a demand drop for insurances in general.\n\nIn order to accommodate such changes, the Automated and Electric Vehicles Act 2018 was introduced. While Part 2 deals with Electric Vehicles, Part 1 covers insurance provisions for automated vehicles.\n\nLabor market [ edit ]\n\nA direct impact of widespread adoption of automated vehicles is the loss of driving-related jobs in the road transport industry.[1][210][211][237] There could be resistance from professional drivers and unions who are threatened by job losses.[238] In addition, there could be job losses in public transit services and crash repair shops. A frequently cited paper by Michael Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey found that automated cars would make many jobs redundant.[239] The industry has, however created thousands of jobs in low-income countries for workers who train autonomous systems.[240]\n\nEnergy and environmental impacts [ edit ]\n\nVehicle use\n\nA review found that private autonomous vehicles may increase total travel, whereas autonomous buses may lead to reduced car use.[241]\n\nVehicle automation can improve fuel economy of the car by optimizing the drive cycle, as well as increasing congested traffic speeds by an estimated 8%-13%.[242][243] Reduced traffic congestion and the improvements in traffic flow due to widespread use of automated cars will translate into higher fuel efficiency, ranging from a 23%-39% increase, with the potential to further increase.[242][244] Additionally, self-driving cars will be able to accelerate and brake more efficiently, meaning higher fuel economy from reducing wasted energy typically associated with inefficient changes to speed. However, the improvement in vehicle energy efficiency does not necessarily translate to net reduction in energy consumption and positive environmental outcomes.\n\nAlongside the induced demand, there may also be a reduction in the use of more sustainable modes, such as public or active transport. It is expected that convenience of the automated vehicles encourages the consumers to travel more, and this induced demand may partially or fully offset the fuel efficiency improvement brought by automation.[243] Alongside the induced demand, there may also be a reduction in the use of more sustainable modes, such as public or active transport.[245] Overall, the consequences of vehicle automation on global energy demand and emissions are highly uncertain, and heavily depends on the combined effect of changes in consumer behavior, policy intervention, technological progress and vehicle technology.[243]\n\nProduction\n\nBy reducing the labor and other costs of mobility as a service, automated cars could reduce the number of cars that are individually owned, replaced by taxi/pooling and other car-sharing services.[246][247] This would also dramatically reduce the size of the automotive production industry, with corresponding environmental and economic effects.\n\nIndirect effects\n\nThe lack of stressful driving, more productive time during the trip, and the potential savings in travel time and cost could become an incentive to live far away from cities, where housing is cheaper, and work in the city\'s core, thus increasing travel distances and inducing more urban sprawl, raising energy consumption and enlarging the carbon footprint of urban travel.[243][248][249] There is also the risk that traffic congestion might increase, rather than decrease.[243][216] Appropriate public policies and regulations, such as zoning, pricing, and urban design are required to avoid the negative impacts of increased suburbanization and longer distance travel.[216][249]\n\nSince many autonomous vehicles are going to rely on electricity to operate, the demand for lithium batteries increases. Similarly, radar, sensors, lidar, and high-speed internet connectivity require higher auxiliary power from vehicles, which manifests as greater power draw from batteries.[243] The larger battery requirement causes a necessary increase in the supply of these type of batteries for the chemical industry. On the other hand, with the expected increase of battery-powered (autonomous) vehicles, the petroleum industry is expected to undergo a decline in demand. As this implication depends on the adoption rate of autonomous vehicles, it is unsure to what extent this implication will disrupt this particular industry. This transition phase of oil to electricity allows companies to explore whether there are business opportunities for them in the new energy ecosystem. In 2020, Mohan, Sripad, Vaishnav & Viswanathan at Carnegie Mellon University[250] found that the electricity consumption of all the automation technology, including sensors, computation, internet access as well as the increased drag from sensors causes up to a 15% impact on the range of an automated electric vehicle, therefore, implying that the larger battery requirement might not be as large as previously assumed.\n\nA study conducted by AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety found that drivers did not trust self-parking technology, even though the systems outperformed drivers with a backup camera. The study tested self-parking systems in a variety of vehicles (Lincoln MKC, Mercedes-Benz ML400 4Matic, Cadillac CTS-V Sport, BMW i3 and Jeep Cherokee Limited) and found that self-parking cars hit the curb 81% fewer times, used 47% fewer manoeuvres and parked 10% faster than drivers. Yet, only 25% of those surveyed said they would trust this technology.[251]\n\nParking space [ edit ]\n\nManually driven vehicles are reported to be used only 4\xe2\x80\x935% of the time, and being parked and unused for the remaining 95\xe2\x80\x9396% of the time.[252][253] Autonomous taxis could, on the other hand, be used continuously after they have reached their destination. This could dramatically reduce the need for parking space. For example, in Los Angeles a 2015 study found 14% of the land is used for parking alone, equivalent to some 1,702 hectares (4,210 acres).[254][255] This combined with the potential reduced need for road space due to improved traffic flow, could free up large amounts of land in urban areas, which could then be used for parks, recreational areas, buildings, among other uses; making cities more livable. Besides this, privately owned self-driving cars, also capable of self-parking would provide another advantage: the ability to drop off and pick up passengers even in places where parking is prohibited. This would benefit park and ride facilities.[256]\n\nPrivacy [ edit ]\n\nThe vehicles\' increased awareness could aid the police by reporting on illegal passenger behaviour, while possibly enabling other crimes, such as deliberately crashing into another vehicle or a pedestrian.[257] However, this may also lead to much-expanded mass surveillance if there is wide access granted to third parties to the large data sets generated.\n\nPrivacy could be an issue when having the vehicle\'s location and position integrated into an interface that other people have access to.[1][258] Moreover, they require a sensor-based infrastructure that would constitute an all-encompassing surveillance apparatus.[259] This gives the car manufacturers and other companies the data needed to understand the user\'s lifestyle and personal preferences.[260]\n\nTerrorist scenarios [ edit ]\n\nThere is the risk of terrorist attacks by automotive hacking through the sharing of information through V2V (Vehicle to Vehicle) and V2I (Vehicle to Infrastructure) protocols.[261][262][263] Self-driving cars could potentially be loaded with explosives and used as bombs.[264] According to legislation of US lawmakers, autonomous and self-driving vehicles should be equipped with defences against hacking.[265]\n\nTaxis [ edit ]\n\nWith the aforementioned ambiguous user preference regarding the personal ownership of autonomous vehicles, it is possible that the current mobility provider trend will continue as it rises in popularity. Established providers such as Uber and Lyft are already significantly present within the industry, and it is likely that new entrants will enter when business opportunities arise.[266]\n\nCar repair [ edit ]\n\nAs collisions are less likely to occur, and the risk for human errors is reduced significantly, the repair industry will face an enormous reduction of work that has to be done on the reparation of car frames. Meanwhile, as the generated data of the autonomous vehicle is likely to predict when certain replaceable parts are in need of maintenance, car owners and the repair industry will be able to proactively replace a part that will fail soon. This ""Asset Efficiency Service"" would implicate a productivity gain for the automotive repair industry.\n\nRescue, emergency response, and military [ edit ]\n\nThe technique used in autonomous driving also ensures life savings in other industries. The implementation of autonomous vehicles with rescue, emergency response, and military applications has already led to a decrease in deaths.[citation needed] Military personnel use autonomous vehicles to reach dangerous and remote places on earth to deliver fuel, food and general supplies and even rescue people. In addition, a future implication of adopting autonomous vehicles could lead to a reduction in deployed personnel, which will lead to a decrease in injuries, since the technological development allows autonomous vehicles to become more and more autonomous. Another future implication is the reduction of emergency drivers when autonomous vehicles are deployed as fire trucks or ambulances. An advantage could be the use of real-time traffic information and other generated data to determine and execute routes more efficiently than human drivers. The time savings can be invaluable in these situations.[267]\n\nInterior design and entertainment [ edit ]\n\nWith the driver decreasingly focused on operating a vehicle, the interior design and media-entertainment industry will have to reconsider what passengers of autonomous vehicles are doing when they are on the road. Vehicles need to be redesigned, and possibly even be prepared for multipurpose usage. In practice, it will show that travellers have more time for business and/or leisure. In both cases, this gives increasing opportunities for the media-entertainment industry to demand attention. Moreover, the advertisement business is able to provide location-based ads without risking driver safety.[268]\n\nTelecommunication [ edit ]\n\nAll cars can benefit from information and connections, but autonomous cars ""Will be fully capable of operating without C-V2X.""[269] In addition, the earlier mentioned entertainment industry is also highly dependent on this network to be active in this market segment. This implies higher revenues for the telecommunication industry.\n\nHospitality industry and airlines [ edit ]\n\nDriver interactions with the vehicle will be less common within the near future, and in the more distant future, the responsibility will lie entirely with the vehicle. As indicated above, this will have implications for the entertainment- and interior design industry. For roadside restaurants, the implication will be that the need for customers to stop driving and enter the restaurant will vanish, and the autonomous vehicle will have a double function. Moreover, accompanied by the rise of disruptive platforms such as Airbnb that have shaken up the hotel industry, the fast increase of developments within the autonomous vehicle industry might cause another implication for their customer bases. In the more distant future, the implication for motels might be that a decrease in guests will occur, since autonomous vehicles could be redesigned as fully equipped bedrooms. The improvements regarding the interior of the vehicles might additionally have implications for the airline industry. In the case of relatively short-haul flights, waiting times at customs or the gate imply lost time and hassle for customers. With the improved convenience in future car travel, it is possible that customers might go for this option, causing a loss in customer bases for the airline industry.[270]\n\nIncidents [ edit ]\n\nTesla Autopilot [ edit ]\n\nIn mid\xe2\x80\x91October 2015, Tesla Motors rolled out version 7 of their software in the US that included Tesla Autopilot capability.[271] On 9 January 2016, Tesla rolled out version 7.1 as an over-the-air update, adding a new ""summon"" feature that allows cars to retrieve or self-park at parking locations without the driver in the car.[272] As of November 2020 , Tesla\'s automated driving features is currently classified as a Level 2 driver assistance system according to the Society of Automotive Engineers\' (SAE) five levels of vehicle automation.[55] At this level the car can be automated but requires the full attention of the driver, who must be prepared to take control at a moment\'s notice;[273][274][275][276] Autopilot will sometimes fail to detect lane markings and disengage itself while alerting the driver.[277]\n\nOn 20 January 2016, the first of five known fatal crashes of a Tesla with Autopilot occurred in China\'s Hubei province.[278] According to China\'s 163.com news channel, this marked ""China\'s first accidental death due to Tesla\'s automatic driving (system)"". Initially, Tesla pointed out that the vehicle was so badly damaged from the impact that their recorder was not able to conclusively prove that the car had been on Autopilot at the time; however, 163.com pointed out that other factors, such as the car\'s absolute failure to take any evasive actions prior to the high speed crash, and the driver\'s otherwise good driving record, seemed to indicate a strong likelihood that the car was on Autopilot at the time. A similar fatal crash occurred four months later in Florida.[279][280] In 2018, in a subsequent civil suit between the father of the driver killed and Tesla, Tesla did not deny that the car had been on Autopilot at the time of the accident, and sent evidence to the victim\'s father documenting that fact.[281]\n\nThe second known fatal accident involving a vehicle being driven by itself took place in Williston, Florida on 7 May 2016 while a Tesla Model S electric car was engaged in Autopilot mode. The occupant was killed in a crash with an 18-wheel tractor-trailer. On 28 June 2016 the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened a formal investigation into the accident working with the Florida Highway Patrol. According to NHTSA, preliminary reports indicate the crash occurred when the tractor-trailer made a left turn in front of the Tesla at an intersection on a non-controlled access highway, and the car failed to apply the brakes. The car continued to travel after passing under the truck\'s trailer.[282][283] NHTSA\'s preliminary evaluation was opened to examine the design and performance of any automated driving systems in use at the time of the crash, which involved a population of an estimated 25,000 Model S cars.[284] On 8 July 2016, NHTSA requested Tesla Motors provide the agency detailed information about the design, operation and testing of its Autopilot technology. The agency also requested details of all design changes and updates to Autopilot since its introduction, and Tesla\'s planned updates schedule for the next four months.[285]\n\nAccording to Tesla, ""neither autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor-trailer against a brightly lit sky, so the brake was not applied."" The car attempted to drive full speed under the trailer, ""with the bottom of the trailer impacting the windshield of the Model S"". Tesla also claimed that this was Tesla\'s first known autopilot death in over 130 million miles (210 million kilometers) driven by its customers with Autopilot engaged, however by this statement, Tesla was apparently refusing to acknowledge claims that the January 2016 fatality in Hubei China had also been the result of an autopilot system error. According to Tesla there is a fatality every 94 million miles (151 million kilometers) among all type of vehicles in the US[282][283][286] However, this number also includes fatalities of the crashes, for instance, of motorcycle drivers with pedestrians.[287][288]\n\nIn July 2016, the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) opened a formal investigation into the fatal accident while the Autopilot was engaged. The NTSB is an investigative body that has the power to make only policy recommendations. An agency spokesman said ""It\'s worth taking a look and seeing what we can learn from that event, so that as that automation is more widely introduced we can do it in the safest way possible.""[289] In January 2017, the NTSB released the report that concluded Tesla was not at fault; the investigation revealed that for Tesla cars, the crash rate dropped by 40 percent after Autopilot was installed.[290]\n\nWaymo [ edit ]\n\nWaymo originated as a self-driving car project within Google. In August 2012, Google announced that their vehicles had completed over 300,000 automated-driving miles (500,000 km) accident-free, typically involving about a dozen cars on the road at any given time, and that they were starting to test with single drivers instead of in pairs.[291] In late-May 2014, Google revealed a new prototype that had no steering wheel, gas pedal, or brake pedal, and was fully automated .[292] As of March 2016 , Google had test-driven their fleet in automated mode a total of 1,500,000 mi (2,400,000 km).[293] In December 2016, Google Corporation announced that its technology would be spun off to a new company called Waymo, with both Google and Waymo becoming subsidiaries of a new parent company called Alphabet.[294][295]\n\nAccording to Google\'s accident reports as of early 2016, their test cars had been involved in 14 collisions, of which other drivers were at fault 13 times, although in 2016 the car\'s software caused a crash.[296]\n\nIn June 2015, Brin confirmed that 12 vehicles had suffered collisions as of that date. Eight involved rear-end collisions at a stop sign or traffic light, two in which the vehicle was side-swiped by another driver, one in which another driver rolled through a stop sign, and one where a Google employee was controlling the car manually.[297] In July 2015, three Google employees suffered minor injuries when their vehicle was rear-ended by a car whose driver failed to brake at a traffic light. This was the first time that a collision resulted in injuries.[298] On 14 February 2016 a Google vehicle attempted to avoid sandbags blocking its path. During the maneuver it struck a bus. Google stated, ""In this case, we clearly bear some responsibility, because if our car hadn\'t moved, there wouldn\'t have been a collision.""[299][300] Google characterized the crash as a misunderstanding and a learning experience. No injuries were reported in the crash.[296]\n\nUber [ edit ]\n\nIn March 2017, an Uber test vehicle was involved in a crash in Tempe, Arizona when another car failed to yield, flipping the Uber vehicle. There were no injuries in the accident.[301]\n\nBy 22 December 2017, Uber had completed 2 million miles (3.2 million kilometers) in automated mode.[302]\n\nOn 18 March 2018, Elaine Herzberg became the first pedestrian to be killed by a self-driving car in the United States after being hit by an Uber vehicle, also in Tempe. Herzberg was crossing outside of a crosswalk, approximately 400 feet from an intersection.[303] This marks the first time an individual is known to have been killed by an autonomous vehicle.\n\nThe first death of an essentially uninvolved third party is likely to raise new questions and concerns about the safety of automated cars in general.[304] Some experts say a human driver could have avoided the fatal crash.[305] Arizona Governor Doug Ducey later suspended the company\'s ability to test and operate its automated cars on public roadways citing an ""unquestionable failure"" of the expectation that Uber make public safety its top priority.[306] Uber has pulled out of all self-driving-car testing in California as a result of the accident.[307] On 24 May 2018 the US National Transport Safety Board issued a preliminary report.[308]\n\nOn 16 September 2020, according to the BBC, the backup driver has been charged of negligent homicide, because she did not look to the road for several seconds while her television was streaming The Voice broadcast by Hulu. Uber does not face any criminal charge because in the USA there is no basis for criminal liability for the corporation. The driver is assumed to be responsible of the accident, because she was in the driver seat in capacity to avoid an accident (like in a Level 3). Trial is planned for February 2021.[309]\n\nNavya automated bus driving system [ edit ]\n\nOn 9 November 2017, a Navya automated self-driving bus with passengers was involved in a crash with a truck. The truck was found to be at fault of the crash, reversing into the stationary automated bus. The automated bus did not take evasive actions or apply defensive driving techniques such as flashing its headlights, or sounding the horn. As one passenger commented, ""The shuttle didn\'t have the ability to move back. The shuttle just stayed still.""[310]\n\nPublic opinion surveys [ edit ]\n\nIn a 2011 online survey of 2,006 US and UK consumers by Accenture, 49% said they would be comfortable using a ""driverless car"".[311]\n\nA 2012 survey of 17,400 vehicle owners by J.D. Power and Associates found 37% initially said they would be interested in purchasing a ""fully autonomous car"". However, that figure dropped to 20% if told the technology would cost US$3,000 more.[312]\n\nIn a 2012 survey of about 1,000 German drivers by automotive researcher Puls, 22% of the respondents had a positive attitude towards these cars, 10% were undecided, 44% were skeptical and 24% were hostile.[313]\n\nA 2013 survey of 1,500 consumers across 10 countries by Cisco Systems found 57% ""stated they would be likely to ride in a car controlled entirely by technology that does not require a human driver"", with Brazil, India and China the most willing to trust automated technology.[314]\n\nIn a 2014 US telephone survey by Insurance.com, over three-quarters of licensed drivers said they would at least consider buying a self-driving car, rising to 86% if car insurance were cheaper. 31.7% said they would not continue to drive once an automated car was available instead.[315]\n\nIn a February 2015 survey of top auto journalists, 46% predict that either Tesla or Daimler will be the first to the market with a fully autonomous vehicle, while (at 38%) Daimler is predicted to be the most functional, safe, and in-demand autonomous vehicle.[316]\n\nIn 2015 a questionnaire survey by Delft University of Technology explored the opinion of 5,000 people from 109 countries on automated driving. Results showed that respondents, on average, found manual driving the most enjoyable mode of driving. 22% of the respondents did not want to spend any money for a fully automated driving system. Respondents were found to be most concerned about software hacking/misuse, and were also concerned about legal issues and safety. Finally, respondents from more developed countries (in terms of lower accident statistics, higher education, and higher income) were less comfortable with their vehicle transmitting data.[317] The survey also gave results on potential consumer opinion on interest of purchasing an automated car, stating that 37% of surveyed current owners were either ""definitely"" or ""probably"" interested in purchasing an automated car.[317]\n\nIn 2016, a survey in Germany examined the opinion of 1,603 people, who were representative in terms of age, gender, and education for the German population, towards partially, highly, and fully automated cars. Results showed that men and women differ in their willingness to use them. Men felt less anxiety and more joy towards automated cars, whereas women showed the exact opposite. The gender difference towards anxiety was especially pronounced between young men and women but decreased with participants\' age.[318]\n\nIn 2016, a PwC survey, in the United States, showing the opinion of 1,584 people, highlights that ""66 percent of respondents said they think autonomous cars are probably smarter than the average human driver"". People are still worried about safety and mostly the fact of having the car hacked. Nevertheless, only 13% of the interviewees see no advantages in this new kind of cars.[319]\n\nIn 2017, Pew Research Center surveyed 4,135 US adults from 1\xe2\x80\x9315 May and found that many Americans anticipate significant impacts from various automation technologies in the course of their lifetimes\xe2\x80\x94from the widespread adoption of automated vehicles to the replacement of entire job categories with robot workers.[320]\n\nIn 2019, results from two opinion surveys of 54 and 187 US adults respectively were published. A new standardised questionnaire, the autonomous vehicle acceptance model (AVAM) was developed, including additional description to help respondents better understand the implications of different automation levels. Results showed that users were less accepting of high autonomy levels and displayed significantly lower intention to use highly autonomous vehicles. Additionally, partial autonomy (regardless of level) was perceived as requiring uniformly higher driver engagement (usage of hands, feet and eyes) than full autonomy.[321]\n\nRegulation [ edit ]\n\nThe Geneva Convention on Road Traffic subscribed to by over 101 countries worldwide, requires the driver to be 18 years old.\n\nThe 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, subscribed to by over 70 countries worldwide, establishes principles to govern traffic laws. One of the fundamental principles of the convention has been the concept that a driver is always fully in control and responsible for the behavior of a vehicle in traffic.[322] In 2016, a reform of the convention has open possibilities for automated features. The progress of technology that assists and takes over the functions of the driver is undermining this principle, implying that much of the groundwork must be rewritten.[citation needed]\n\nThis means that in those countries cars might be automated or autonomous or self-driving but not driver-less.\n\nLegislation in Japan [ edit ]\n\nIn 2019, Japan amended two laws, ""Road Traffic Act"" and ""Road Transport Vehicle Act"",[323] and they came into effect in April 2020. In the former act, Level 3 self driving cars became allowed on public roads.[324] In the latter act, process to designate types for safety certification on Level 3 self driving function of Autonomous Driving System (ADS) and the certification process for the asserted type were legally defined.[325] Through the amendment process, the achievements from the national project ""SIP-adus"" led by Cabinet Office since 2014 were fully considered and accepted.[326]\n\nIn 2020, the next stage national level roadmap plan was officially issued which had considered social deployment and acceptability of Level 4.[327][328]\n\nIn 2021, National Police Agency published its committee report of FY 2020 on summary of issues in research to realize Level 4 mobility services, including required legal amendment issues.[329][330]\n\nLegal status in the United States [ edit ]\n\nUS states that allow testing of autonomous vehicles on public roads as of June 2018\n\nIn the United States, a non-signatory country to the Vienna Convention, state vehicle codes generally do not envisage\xe2\x80\x94but do not necessarily prohibit\xe2\x80\x94highly automated vehicles as of 2012 .[331][332] To clarify the legal status of and otherwise regulate such vehicles, several states have enacted or are considering specific laws.[333] By 2016, seven states (Nevada, California, Florida, Michigan, Hawaii, Washington, and Tennessee), along with the District of Columbia, have enacted laws for automated vehicles. Incidents such as the first fatal accident by Tesla\'s Autopilot system have led to discussion about revising laws and standards for automated cars.\n\nFederal policies [ edit ]\n\nIn September 2016, the US National Economic Council and US Department of Transportation (USDOT) released the Federal Automated Vehicles Policy,[334] which are standards that describe how automated vehicles should react if their technology fails, how to protect passenger privacy, and how riders should be protected in the event of an accident. The new federal guidelines are meant to avoid a patchwork of state laws, while avoiding being so overbearing as to stifle innovation.[335] Since then, USDOT has released multiple updates:\n\nAutomated Driving Systems: A Vision for Safety 2.0 (12 September 2017) [336]\n\n(12 September 2017) Preparing for the Future of Transportation: Automated Vehicles 3.0 (4 October 2018) [337]\n\n(4 October 2018) Ensuring American Leadership in Automated Vehicle Technologies: Automated Vehicles 4.0 (8 January 2020)[338]\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration released for public comment the Occupant Protection for Automated Driving System on 30 March 2020,[339] followed by the Framework for Automated Driving System Safety on 3 December 2020.[340] Occupant Protection is intended to modernize the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards considering the removal of manual controls with automated driving systems,[341] while the Framework document is intended to provide an objective way to define and assess automated driving system competence to ensure motor vehicle safety while also remaining flexible to accommodate the development of features to improve safety.[342]\n\nState policies [ edit ]\n\nNevada\n\nIn June 2011, the Nevada Legislature passed a law to authorize the use of automated cars. Nevada thus became the first jurisdiction in the world where automated vehicles might be legally operated on public roads. According to the law, the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles is responsible for setting safety and performance standards and the agency is responsible for designating areas where automated cars may be tested.[343][344][345] This legislation was supported by Google in an effort to legally conduct further testing of its Google driverles'";"Autonomous Cars";"1.txt-Autonomous Cars"

"101.txt";"b'National Security Implications of Leadership in Autonomous Vehicles\n\nJune 28, 2021\n\nDigital technologies have created a transitional moment for societies. High-speed connectivity, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI) are ubiquitous (even if not always visible) and are reshaping economies by creating new opportunities. This follows a pattern set centuries ago. Automation of basic tasks began in the eighteenth century and accelerated rapidly at the end of the nineteenth century, with a new wave of automation now well underway. Autonomous systems already create value across global markets by lowering costs and improving services. The ability to combine better sensors, more powerful computer processing, and faster connectivity expands the productivity of human labor, creates new services, and automates existing ones.\n\nOne of the most important parts of the next wave of automation is transportation, specifically the appearance of self-driving, or \xe2\x80\x9cautonomous,\xe2\x80\x9d vehicles (AVs). Self-driving cars offer immense gains in productivity and safety. The technologies developed for self-driving cars have broad commercial (and potentially military) implications. A self-driving car is a vehicle capable of navigating without a driver actively operating or monitoring it. Self-driving cars are a kind of specialized robot\xe2\x80\x94not the humanoid robot common to popular culture, but self-operating devices that provide a commercially valuable service and automate routine tasks.\n\nThe impact of autonomous systems on the auto industry will be significant, as the technology behind AVs will reshape transportation and urban life as profoundly as the move from horses to cars. AVs are already a leadingsector for private AI investment, reflecting the market\xe2\x80\x99s estimate of their future importance.\n\nAutomation and the larger digital transformation create major challenges for national security, and the implications of AVs on national security deserve further attention. In addition to new opportunities, widespread deployment of AVs can also create new risks and vulnerabilities, particularly when considered in the context of tech competition between the United States and China.\n\nNational security can be defined as the condition where people can choose how they are governed and live in a world guided by the rule of law. To attain this requires an ability to defend the national interest and, increasingly, an ability to create and use technology in ways that support national security for both the near and long term. Technological leadership used to be seen as important for a few sectors, but its importance has spread across the entire economy. Innovation and the adoption of new technologies are the keys to the long-term growth needed for national security. This is particularly true for automobiles. Cars are now high-tech devices. Vehicles are built around semiconductors and software more than precisely engineered metal parts. The ability to build the cars of the future will be a good indicator of a country\xe2\x80\x99s technological strength and abilities.\n\nThe Military Applications of Autonomous Vehicles\n\nAs much of the innovation and work on AVs is now happening in the private sector, it is reasonable to ask how much carryover there will be from commercial to military uses. In the early stages of developing AV technology, there was considerable overlap. As development progressed, there has been divergence, and the direct application of commercial autonomy will be smaller (the same way a combat aircraft and a passenger aircraft that share certain technologies can jointly benefit from research and development but are ultimately designed for fundamentally different purposes and requirements).\n\nAutonomous devices that operate without human control are deeply attractive to militaries and are already deployed in aerospace and undersea vehicles by leading military powers. Autonomous ground vehicles are more challenging to develop, given the much more complex and varied terrain in which operations take place, but innovation in the commercial self-driving sector could improve military vehicles\xe2\x80\x99 operations. This will be seen first in logistics and support vehicles (e.g., autonomous trucks), where the transition from commercial to military is simpler, and perhaps later in combat vehicles.\n\nIt is not an accident that the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) was the government agency that began work on autonomous driving in 1984 with its Autonomous Land Vehicle program. DARPA then sponsored the earliest AV test in its Grand Challenges, which sought to accelerate the development of AV technologies by holding a race among prototypes for a cash prize. No one completed the first Grand Challenge in 2004. The second iteration, held in a desert area in 2005, was won by a university team which completed the 132-mile course in seven hours. DARPA held a third Grand Challenge two years later in a simulated urban environment, which was also won by another university team. These DARPA efforts, established in response to a 2001 National Defense Authorization Act mandate, jump-started the research into autonomous driving.\n\nBut the current geopolitical contest that threatens U.S. security is not a traditional military competition. It is a new kind of contest that underscores the importance of innovation capabilities and technology leadership. This means that having a strong AV sector, even if not directly applied to military use, is essential for national security. While there may be \xe2\x80\x9cspillover\xe2\x80\x9d effects from technology developed for commercial vehicles for military equipment, the primary contribution will be in strengthening digital industries. That is what will improve national economic performance and help reduce supply chain and espionage concerns. The importance of commercial development has grown. Since the end of the Cold War, advanced technologies have frequently originated in the private sector. The countries that will do best in economics and security will be those that have a strong private-sector tech base from which they can draw upon commercial technological developments.\n\nThe current geopolitical contest that threatens U.S. security is not a traditional military competition. . . . having a strong AV sector, even if not directly applied to military use, is essential for national security.\n\nThe main contribution of AVs to national security, however, does not come from self-driving tanks, but from the importance of the automotive sector to the nation. The automotive industry contributes 3.5 percent of U.S. GDP, making it one of the most important areas of industrial activity (as a comparison, the space and aerospace sector\xe2\x80\x99s share is 4 percent). The development of autonomous and electric vehicles involves the ability to develop and deploy a broad range of important emerging technologies, such as AI, autonomy, and electric propulsion and batteries, and will drive progress in innovation in ways that shape many sectors. Even though the vast majority of the vehicle market is commercial and civilian, when looking at the value of economic strength to national security, AVs are a critical sector for overall national security.\n\nAV Development in the Context of Tech Competition\n\nThe digital transition comes at a moment of significant geopolitical competition. The nature of global competition has changed and is increasingly a battle over technology and economic growth. The national capability to design, build, and innovate in technology will be crucial in this contest.\n\nTechnology creates new kinds of competition and conflict. Leadership in innovation and technology is central to global influence, prestige, and power. AVs are at the cutting edge of technology and are crucial to future U.S. strength. The United States has learned the hard way\xe2\x80\x94in the case of telecom infrastructure manufacturing and Huawei\xe2\x80\x99s extensive deployment and reach\xe2\x80\x94that it is not in the United States\xe2\x80\x99 interest to lose a strategic industry or to find itself dependent on an adversarial foreign power for key technologies. While there is minimal risk that the dynamic automotive sector in the United States would disappear like Nortel or Lucent, keeping this sector strong is essential for the national interest and national security. Automobiles are not an industry the United States can afford to lose any more than it would want to lose its aerospace industry.\n\nDeploying fully autonomous cars is an immense technological challenge, requiring advances in computing, sensors, and networking. The first step has been the deployment of assisted driving systems, which are now relatively common in newer cars. Full autonomy is several levels beyond this and in various stages of testing by several companies. This involves further advances in sensors and processing. The work to meet these challenges will deepen the U.S. technological base and, by commercializing research, strengthen it. Companies will also need a supportive regulatory environment to be able to deploy AVs at commercial scale. For the United States, a strong technology base and supportive regulatory environment is crucial for national security and for maintaining its global influence and economic strength.\n\nThe ability to apply new technologies to commercial and security matters is as important as the ability to create them. Nations that have the companies and skills to develop AI and apply it to economic activities will be stronger and more secure. It is not surprising then that more and more countries are developing their own AI strategies, highlighting their importance for growth and safety. Sixty countries have already collectively issued over 600 AI policy initiatives, including governance efforts and financial support for the sector. These policies will also help make the implementers more influential in the global arena, where global perceptions of tech leadership and economic performance provide substantial political benefit. This has been a core part of the United States\xe2\x80\x99 international strength since landing on the moon in the late 1960s and is one reason why the competition with China creates such serious concerns.\n\nFor the United States, a strong technology base and supportive regulatory environment is crucial for national security and for maintaining its global influence and economic strength.\n\nAdopting new technologies is the best path to creating wealth for countries such as the United States and the best way to increase productivity (which has been a problem for the United States and others, including China). AVs\xe2\x80\x99 most important contribution to national security may come from increasing the United States\xe2\x80\x99 productivity and wealth as part of the larger AI and robotics revolution.\n\nThe United States and China\n\nThere is a clear competition between the United States and China, and a major part of this competition is over leadership in technology. Both sides recognize the economic and security returns of technological leadership, and China has sought technological independence from the West for more than a century. The longer-term contest between the two is over how the world will be structured, and technological leadership is increasingly a determinant of national power.\n\nChina has a very different view of how societies should be governed, how international relations should be structured, and what its place should be among great powers. China is making a concerted and public effort to obtain superiority and to dominate key markets. The MIC2025 plan exemplifies the focus and importance of the technology sector. There are long-standing plans in China (albeit with mixed results) for a massive expansion of its technological capability. There is now a growing realization in the United States that it needs to respond to this, embodied in proposed legislation such as the Endless Frontier Act.\n\nThe desire in China to develop indigenous technological capabilities equivalent to the West dates back to the nineteenth century when European industrialization and its consequences displaced China from what it sees as its rightful place. China\xe2\x80\x99s lack of advanced technologies allowed troubling European interventions in China\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign affairs and began what the Chinese refer to as the \xe2\x80\x9cCentury of Humiliation,\xe2\x80\x9d where the once-great power lost sovereign control to imperialist states in Europe. Almost two centuries later, after surpassing Europe economically, China believes it has reached a moment when it can return to the center of global power. The obstacle to this return is the United States.\n\nThere are many questions about this Chinese narrative of resurgence under the Chinese Communist Party\xe2\x80\x99s (CCP) rule, but it meets compelling domestic political needs. The CCP\xe2\x80\x99s claim to unchallenged rule is buttressed by powerful nationalist sentiments, long present in China as a reaction to the West and now exploited by the CCP. China\xe2\x80\x99s president Xi Jinping has been clear in his views that the West is in decline and that a new world order should be centered on China. China\xe2\x80\x99s rise has been propelled by a number of factors, including heavy state investment in technology, but also by illicit measures, including a disregard for its World Trade Organization (WTO) commitments on the treatment of foreign companies, intellectual property (IP) theft, and a massive industrial espionage campaign targeting Western technology. China feels justified in these actions because of the Century of Humiliation and an artificial narrative about how the United States also relies on similar measures.\n\nChina\xe2\x80\x99s goals are to ensure that its economic development and modernization continues, to end reliance on foreign technologies, and to build a technology base strong enough to produce high-tech weaponry and commercial products that, when combined with subsidies, can displace foreign competitors. China uses a hybrid state/market model. \xe2\x80\x9cMilitary-Civil Fusion\xe2\x80\x9d moves China\xe2\x80\x99s economy much closer to a wartime footing, with a deep integration of the civilian and defense technological systems. Except in a few key areas, China\xe2\x80\x99s innovation system remains weaker than that of the United States. Self-driving cars, however, are an area where there are several competitive Chinese firms and Chinese technology is strong. China\xe2\x80\x99s government seeks to replace the United States in technological leadership and utilize technologies such as AVs to boost its military and economic competitiveness.\n\nThe 2021 annual threat assessment by the U.S. intelligence community addressed the risks to the United States\xe2\x80\x99 national security from emerging technologies. The report concludes that China will maintain its policies to promote indigenous technological innovation, since Chinese leaders perceive these policies as the way to \xe2\x80\x9creduce the dependence on foreign technologies, enable military advances, and sustain economic growth and thus ensure the CCP\xe2\x80\x99s survival.\xe2\x80\x9d AVs and self-driving cars are part of this larger competition between the United States and China. They are also central to the competition over the development and use of AI. In all countries, this AI competition involves a blend of government funding and private actors driven in part or entirely by market incentives and government subsidies.\n\nChina already has a robust AV industry aimed at the commercial market. In early 2017, Qiushi (the official journal of the CCP) identified innovative military technologies, such as unmanned tanks and remote-controlled shop trucks, as a unique opportunity for China to exceed the United States in military power.\n\nBoth China and the United States have advantages and disadvantages in a contest that revolves around technology, research, and investment. The United States benefits from a robust entrepreneurial environment, a dynamic and risk-taking financial system, a strong research base, and an innovation community skilled at commercializing research. China also has an entrepreneurial private sector and a growing research sector, but the government\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to invest large amounts over many years in its technological base is its primary advantage over the United States.\n\nChinese behaviors have eroded the commercial and technological globalization of the last three decades and, more importantly, pose a real national security risk to the United States. A world where China sets the rules will find that the rules are used to meet the needs of the CCP. Privacy is nonexistent in China and will be nonexistent in a world China leads. China will use its political power to confer commercial advantage on its companies at the expense of foreign competitors. This sounds harsh, but it is a description of the CCP, not of China itself.\n\nToday, China has the world\xe2\x80\x99s second-largest economy, supported by state-directed investment, is conducting aggressive industrial espionage programs globally over the internet, and is exhibiting a continued unwillingness to observe trade obligations. Using a Chinese AV, with all its internet connections, could be as risky as using Chinese telecoms.\n\nAutonomous Vehicles Will Create New Cybersecurity Risks and Vulnerabilities\n\nCybercrime is a lucrative activity. It cost the global economy more than a trillion dollars in 2019, and the rate of increase in costs has accelerated since 2010. Cybercrime harms public safety, undermines national security, and damages economies. Ransomware, phishing schemes, and cryptocurrencies make it easier to succeed and monetize cybercrime and, when combined with the sanctuary offered by big countries, help explain the rapid increase. AVs, given their reliance on software, computing, and connectivity, could be a new vector for cybersecurity risks.\n\nCars have become rolling computers, loaded with cameras, microphones, and other sensors, all operated by complex software. Increasingly, modern cars connect to the internet and collect information on location, speed, and perhaps on driver communications (e.g., text, email, voice). This means that data from cars can be accessed remotely, with the owner\xe2\x80\x99s permission or perhaps without it. Manufacturers already use this information for safety, convenience, predictive maintenance, and increasingly for entertainment. Future cars will collect even more data.\n\nSome of that data can reference locations and geographical features. Cross-border data transmission can be problematic if sensitive information is being collected. A 2017 paper from the Chinese Academy of Telecommunication Research of China\xe2\x80\x99s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology addresses that collection of information and considers it a matter of national security if foreign cars are used in China.\n\nAnything that is connected to the internet is vulnerable. The hardware and software behind AVs create a range of opportunities to hackers, as does the need to integrate hardware and software. Many different systems interact in a self-driving car and provide opportunities for hacking to manipulate different systems, including navigation, entertainment, or connectivity with other cars and infrastructure. Given their reliance on continuous communication, another concern is external manipulation of AV systems. From manipulating indicators or attacking the camera system to read speed signs incorrectly, to tampering with road paint to misguide the vehicle, AVs contribute to a vulnerable threat environment.\n\nIn-vehicle and inter-vehicle communication systems are necessary for the safe operation of AVs. In similar ways to the vulnerabilities created by the Internet of Things (IoT), the \xe2\x80\x9cInternet of Vehicles\xe2\x80\x9d (IoV) creates new challenges for cybersecurity. Cars have become another device at the edge of the network where connectivity tempts attackers. Vehicles require not only that their systems be able to communicate with each other, but also connect with other AVs or infrastructure relying on a wireless network.\n\nAnything that is connected to the internet is vulnerable. The hardware and software behind AVs create a range of opportunities to hackers, as does the need to integrate hardware and software.\n\nSupply chains can be compromised from the start. If AVs come from an untrustworthy source or if there are supply chain risks, even the best cybersecurity will not have an impact in risk reduction. A vehicle could be 100 percent unhackable, but if the manufacturer has built-in access and collection or if the information collected by the vehicle is sent over the internet to a hostile country, it will circumvent any defense. There is no need for a back door when the manufacturer has the key to the front door.\n\nRecent events highlight the potential for cybersecurity risks with AVs. Ransomware attacks, where an individual car or a class of cars could be rendered inoperable until a ransom is paid, are possible. While these could be aimed at individual car owners, it is more likely that cybercriminals will go after fleet operations or car manufacturers as better-paying possibilities. While a strong domestic AV industry will not eliminate cybersecurity risk, it would be much more preferable than a supply and car industry located in a hostile competitor.\n\nEspionage and Autonomous Vehicles\n\nThe concerns regarding cybersecurity and data protection are not only important for user protection, but also in the context of national security and geopolitical competition with China. The trove of data collected by AVs, paired with cybersecurity vulnerabilities, creates an appealing target for intelligence collection. AVs will require thinking of cars in a new way when it comes to espionage risk.\n\nIt is unlikely that the governments of other major car producers\xe2\x80\x94Germany, Japan, and Korea\xe2\x80\x94will exploit this advantage. They have no political or security motive to do so. China is another matter, however. A 2020 survey of Chinese espionage by CSIS found 152 publicly reported instances of Chinese espionage directed at the United States since 2000. This did not include espionage against U.S. firms or persons located in China, nor did it include the more than 1,200 IP theft cases brought by U.S. companies against Chinese entities. U.S. officials have repeatedly stated that China\xe2\x80\x99s espionage efforts exceed in scope and scale what was seen in the Cold War. This is because global digital networks and technologies provide China with immense new opportunities for espionage.\n\nIn China, the 2017 National Intelligence Law permits the Chinese government to demand and receive information from Chinese companies and citizens. Article 14 reads that \xe2\x80\x9cstate intelligence work organs, when legally carrying forth intelligence work, may demand that concerned organs, organizations, or citizens provide needed support, assistance, and cooperation.\xe2\x80\x9d Legally carrying forth intelligence work means any action authorized by the CPP leadership, which keeps close control over China\xe2\x80\x99s intelligence agencies and activities.\n\nThis means that data on location, behavior, and potentially conversations from the operators of Chinese-made cars could be accessed by the government over the internet. China is the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest surveillance state, and Chinese network technologies provide the Chinese government with the tools for monitoring behavior and collecting information on residents in its territory\xe2\x80\x94early examples include \xe2\x80\x9cGolden Shield\xe2\x80\x9d (a massive communications surveillance program) and \xe2\x80\x9cGreen Dam\xe2\x80\x9d (a monitoring and censorship program required on laptops in China). China may have tipped its hand about intent when it banned Tesla vehicles from driving into military facilities and housing compounds for personnel working in sensitive industries and state agencies. (Tesla has attempted to placate the Chinese by promising to hold all Chinese data in China.) The features that allow the collection and exfiltration of data potentially make cars an ideal surveillance platform.\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nIf this contest did not involve an unscrupulous and adversarial foreign power, it would be a normal commercial competition among companies, governed by the rules that apply to trade and the protection of IP. Commercial competition shapes U.S., European, Korean, and Japanese auto companies, but the same is not always true for China, where the government can play a much more directive role. That difference is what makes the contest over AVs so important.\n\nThere is a strong research base in Europe, and a long heritage of skilled engineering, but they have had difficulty commercializing the results of research. This may be less of a handicap in self-driving cars, given the strength and central position of the German auto industry, as long as Europe has access to leading-edge AI research and microelectronics from European and non-European sources. The contest takes place in a complicated international political environment. The chief complication is with Europe. Simply put, Berlin is a major driver of European policy, and it is currently unwilling to push hard on China because it is an essential market for Germany\xe2\x80\x99s car industry\xe2\x80\x94even though the Germans fear that China\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate intent is to ransack their automotive technology and displace German carmakers. This could damage a major U.S. security and economic partner in ways that harm both its interests and those of the United States. Trends in European politics suggest this more relaxed approach to China may be changing as suspicions about China\xe2\x80\x99s economic and political power grow.\n\nThe United States has also begun to address the decades-long shortfall in public investment on research and technology. The United States is unused to being challenged and was not prepared for this challenge from China. It has relied on technology to provide a qualitative advantage over opponents since World War II, but the requirements for technological advantage have changed. In the past, technological superiority was produced by a superb scientific establishment, long-term federal support for research, and close links between the research and industrial communities. Both support and linkages atrophied in the last few decades. More importantly, technological innovation is now led by the private sector and oriented toward commercial markets. This is where qualitative advantage for national security will come from in the future.\n\nTechnological progress is cumulative and continuous, and the pace at which nations adopt new technologies will help to determine their security relative to others. The nation that \xe2\x80\x9cdominates\xe2\x80\x9d AI (to quote Russian president Vladimir Putin) will not be \xe2\x80\x9cthe ruler of the world,\xe2\x80\x9d but the nation that is best at creating and accommodating technological change will do better in economics and security than others. The ability to employ AI and autonomous systems to gain better performance, new digital services, and create wealth is at the core of the new international competition and an area where the United States must ensure that its policies and regulations keep it competitive. No nation will \xe2\x80\x9cdominate\xe2\x80\x9d AI or the AV market, but being a leader in autonomy is a vital U.S. interest and crucial for national security.\n\nJames Andrew Lewis is a senior vice president and director of the Strategic Technologies Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, D.C.\n\nThis report is made possible by support from Cruise LLC.\n\nThis report is produced by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a private, tax-exempt institution focusing on international public policy issues.

Waymo became the first service provider to offer robotaxi rides to the general public in a part of Phoenix, Arizona in 2020, while Tesla has said it will offer subscription-based ""full self-driving"" to private vehicle owners in 2021,[9][10] and Nuro has been allowed to start autonomous commercial delivery operations in California in 2021.[11] In China two publicly accessible trials of robo-taxis have been launched, in 2020 in Shenzhen\'s Pingshan District by Chinese firm AutoX[12] and in 2021 at Shougang Park in Beijing by Baidu, a venue for the 2022 Winter Olympics.[13]\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nExperiments have been conducted on automated driving systems (ADS) since at least the 1920s;[14] trials began in the 1950s. The first semi-automated car was developed in 1977, by Japan\'s Tsukuba Mechanical Engineering Laboratory, which required specially marked streets that were interpreted by two cameras on the vehicle and an analog computer. The vehicle reached speeds up to 30 kilometres per hour (19 mph) with the support of an elevated rail.[15][16]\n\nA landmark autonomous car appeared in the 1980s, with Carnegie Mellon University\'s Navlab[17] and ALV[18][19] projects funded by the United States\' Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) starting in 1984 and Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich\'s EUREKA Prometheus Project in 1987.[20] By 1985, the ALV had demonstrated self-driving speeds on two-lane roads of 31 kilometres per hour (19 mph), with obstacle avoidance added in 1986, and off-road driving in day and nighttime conditions by 1987.[21] A major milestone was achieved in 1995, with CMU\'s NavLab 5 completing the first autonomous coast-to-coast drive of the United States. Of the 2,849 mi (4,585 km) between Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and San Diego, California, 2,797 mi (4,501 km) were autonomous (98.2%), completed with an average speed of 63.8 mph (102.7 km/h).[22][23][24][25] From the 1960s through the second DARPA Grand Challenge in 2005, automated vehicle research in the United States was primarily funded by DARPA, the US Army, and the US Navy, yielding incremental advances in speeds, driving competence in more complex conditions, controls, and sensor systems.[26] Companies and research organizations have developed prototypes.[20][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34]\n\nThe US allocated US$650 million in 1991 for research on the National Automated Highway System, which demonstrated automated driving through a combination of automation embedded in the highway with automated technology in vehicles, and cooperative networking between the vehicles and with the highway infrastructure. The program concluded with a successful demonstration in 1997 but without clear direction or funding to implement the system on a larger scale.[35] Partly funded by the National Automated Highway System and DARPA, the Carnegie Mellon University Navlab drove 4,584 kilometres (2,848 mi) across America in 1995, 4,501 kilometres (2,797 mi) or 98% of it autonomously.[36] Navlab\'s record achievement stood unmatched for two decades until 2015, when Delphi improved it by piloting an Audi, augmented with Delphi technology, over 5,472 kilometres (3,400 mi) through 15 states while remaining in self-driving mode 99% of the time.[37] In 2015, the US states of Nevada, Florida, California, Virginia, and Michigan, together with Washington, DC, allowed the testing of automated cars on public roads.[38]\n\nFrom 2016 to 2018, the European Commission funded an innovation strategy development for connected and automated driving through the Coordination Actions CARTRE and SCOUT.[39] Moreover, the Strategic Transport Research and Innovation Agenda (STRIA) Roadmap for Connected and Automated Transport was published in 2019.[40]\n\nIn November 2017, Waymo announced that it had begun testing driverless cars without a safety driver in the driver position;[41] however, there was still an employee in the car.[42] An October 2017 report by the Brookings Institute found that the $80 billion had been reported as invested in all facets of self driving technology up to that point, but that it was ""reasonable to presume that total global investment in autonomous vehicle technology is significantly more than this.""[43]\n\nIn October 2018, Waymo announced that its test vehicles had traveled in automated mode for over 10,000,000 miles (16,000,000 km), increasing by about 1,000,000 miles (1,600,000 kilometres) per month.[44] In December 2018, Waymo was the first to commercialize a fully autonomous taxi service in the US, in Phoenix, Arizona.[45] In October 2020, Waymo launched a geo-fenced driverless ride hailing service in Phoenix.[46][47] The cars are being monitored in real-time by a team of remote engineers, and there are cases where the remote engineers need to intervene.[48][47]\n\nIn March 2019, ahead of the autonomous racing series Roborace, Robocar set the Guinness World Record for being the fastest autonomous car in the world. In pushing the limits of self-driving vehicles, Robocar reached 282.42 km/h (175.49 mph) \xe2\x80\x93 an average confirmed by the UK Timing Association at Elvington in Yorkshire, UK.[49]\n\nIn 2020, a National Transportation Safety Board chairman stated that no self-driving cars (SAE level 3+) were available for consumers to purchase in the US in 2020:\n\nThere is not a vehicle currently available to US consumers that is self-driving. Period. Every vehicle sold to US consumers still requires the driver to be actively engaged in the driving task, even when advanced driver assistance systems are activated. If you are selling a car with an advanced driver assistance system, you\xe2\x80\x99re not selling a self-driving car. If you are driving a car with an advanced driver assistance system, you don\xe2\x80\x99t own a self-driving car.[50]\n\nOn 5 March 2021, Honda began leasing in Japan a limited edition of 100 Legend Hybrid EX sedans equipped with the newly approved Level 3 automated driving equipment which had been granted the safety certification by Japanese government to their autonomous ""Traffic Jam Pilot"" driving technology, and legally allow drivers to take their eyes off the road.[51][52][53][54]\n\nDefinitions and classifications [ edit ]\n\nThere is some inconsistency in the terminology used in the self-driving car industry. Various organizations have proposed to define an accurate and consistent vocabulary.\n\nIn 2014, such confusion has been documented in SAE J3016 which states that ""some vernacular usages associate autonomous specifically with full driving automation (Level 5), while other usages apply it to all levels of driving automation, and some state legislation has defined it to correspond approximately to any ADS [automated driving system] at or above Level 3 (or to any vehicle equipped with such an ADS).""\n\nTerminology and safety considerations [ edit ]\n\nModern vehicles provide features such as keeping the car within its lane, speed controls, or emergency braking. Those features alone are just considered as driver assistance technologies because they still require a human driver control while fully automated vehicles drive themselves without human driver input.\n\nAccording to Fortune, some newer vehicles\' technology names\xe2\x80\x94such as AutonoDrive, PilotAssist, Full-Self Driving or DrivePilot\xe2\x80\x94might confuse the driver, who may believe no driver input is expected when in fact the driver needs to remain involved in the driving task.[55] According to the BBC, confusion between those concepts leads to deaths.[56]\n\nFor this reason, some organizations such as the AAA try to provide standardized naming conventions for features such as ALKS which aim to have capacity to manage the driving task, but which are not yet approved to be an automated vehicles in any countries. The Association of British Insurers considers the usage of the word autonomous in marketing for modern cars to be dangerous because car ads make motorists think \'autonomous\' and \'autopilot\' mean a vehicle can drive itself when they still rely on the driver to ensure safety. Technology alone still is not able to drive the car.\n\nSome car makers suggest or claim vehicles are self-driving when they are not able to manage some driving situations. Despite being called Full Self-Driving, Tesla stated that its offering should not be considered as a fully autonomous driving system.[57] This makes drivers risk becoming excessively confident, taking distracted driving behavior, leading to crashes. While in Great-Britain, a fully self-driving car is only a car registered in a specific list.[58] There have also been proposals to adopt the aviation automation safety knowledge into the discussions of safe implementation of autonomous vehicles, due to the experience that has been gained over the decades by the aviation sector on safety topics. [59]\n\nAutonomous vs. automated [ edit ]\n\nAutonomous means self-governing.[60] Many historical projects related to vehicle automation have been automated (made automatic) subject to a heavy reliance on artificial aids in their environment, such as magnetic strips. Autonomous control implies satisfactory performance under significant uncertainties in the environment, and the ability to compensate for system failures without external intervention.[60]\n\nOne approach is to implement communication networks both in the immediate vicinity (for collision avoidance) and farther away (for congestion management). Such outside influences in the decision process reduce an individual vehicle\'s autonomy, while still not requiring human intervention.\n\nWood et al. (2012) wrote, ""This Article generally uses the term \'autonomous,\' instead of the term \'automated.\' "" The term ""autonomous"" was chosen ""because it is the term that is currently in more widespread use (and thus is more familiar to the general public). However, the latter term is arguably more accurate. \'Automated\' connotes control or operation by a machine, while \'autonomous\' connotes acting alone or independently. Most of the vehicle concepts (that we are currently aware of) have a person in the driver\'s seat, utilize a communication connection to the Cloud or other vehicles, and do not independently select either destinations or routes for reaching them. Thus, the term \'automated\' would more accurately describe these vehicle concepts.""[61]\n\nAs of 2017, most commercial projects focused on automated vehicles that did not communicate with other vehicles or with an enveloping management regime. EuroNCAP defines autonomous in ""Autonomous Emergency Braking"" as: ""the system acts independently of the driver to avoid or mitigate the accident."" which implies the autonomous system is not the driver.[62]\n\nIn Europe, the words automated and autonomous might also be used together. For instance, Regulation (EU) 2019/2144 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2019 on type-approval requirements for motor vehicles (...) defines ""automated vehicle"" and ""fully automated vehicle"" based on their autonomous capacity:[63]\n\n""automated vehicle"" means a motor vehicle designed and constructed to move autonomously for certain periods of time without continuous driver supervision but in respect of which driver intervention is still expected or required; [63]\n\n""fully automated vehicle"" means a motor vehicle that has been designed and constructed to move autonomously without any driver supervision;[63]\n\nIn British English, the word automated alone might have several meaning, such in the sentence: ""Thatcham also found that the automated lane keeping systems could only meet two out of the twelve principles required to guarantee safety, going on to say they cannot, therefore, be classed as \xe2\x80\x98automated driving\xe2\x80\x99, instead it claims the tech should be classed as \xe2\x80\x98assisted driving\xe2\x80\x99."":[64] The first occurrence of the ""automated"" word refers to an Unece automated system, while the second occurrence refers to the British legal definition of an automated vehicle. The British law interprets the meaning of ""automated vehicle"" based on the interpretation section related to a vehicle ""driving itself"" and an insured vehicle.[65]\n\nAutonomous versus cooperative [ edit ]\n\nTo enable a car to travel without any driver embedded within the vehicle, some companies use a remote driver.[66]\n\nAccording to SAE J3016,\n\nSome driving automation systems may indeed be autonomous if they perform all of their functions independently and self-sufficiently, but if they depend on communication and/or cooperation with outside entities, they should be considered cooperative rather than autonomous.\n\nClassifications [ edit ]\n\nSelf-driving car [ edit ]\n\nPC Magazine defines a self-driving car as ""a computer-controlled car that drives itself.""[67] The Union of Concerned Scientists states that self-driving cars are ""cars or trucks in which human drivers are never required to take control to safely operate the vehicle. Also known as autonomous or \'driverless\' cars, they combine sensors and software to control, navigate, and drive the vehicle.""[68]\n\nThe British Automated and Electric Vehicles Act 2018 law defines considers a vehicle as ""driving itself"" if the vehicle ""is operating in a mode in which it is not being controlled, and does not need to be monitored, by an individual"".[69]\n\nSAE Classification [ edit ]\n\nA classification system with six levels \xe2\x80\x93 ranging from fully manual to fully automated systems \xe2\x80\x93 was published in 2014 by automotive standardization body SAE International (formerly the Society of Automotive Engineers) as J3016, Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to On-Road Motor Vehicle Automated Driving Systems.[72][73] This classification is based on the amount of driver intervention and attentiveness required, rather than the vehicle\'s capabilities, although these are loosely related. In the United States in 2013, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) released a formal classification system,[74] but abandoned it in favor of the SAE standard in 2016. Also in 2016, SAE updated its classification, called J3016_201609.[75]\n\nLevels of driving automation [ edit ]\n\nIn SAE\'s automation level definitions, ""driving mode"" means ""a type of driving scenario with characteristic dynamic driving task requirements (e.g., expressway merging, high speed cruising, low speed traffic jam, closed-campus operations, etc.)""[1][76]\n\nLevel 0: The automated system issues warnings and may momentarily intervene but has no sustained vehicle control.\n\nLevel 1 (""hands on""): The driver and the automated system share control of the vehicle. Examples are systems where the driver controls steering and the automated system controls engine power to maintain a set speed (Cruise Control) or engine and brake power to maintain and vary speed (Adaptive Cruise Control or ACC); and Parking Assistance, where steering is automated while speed is under manual control. The driver must be ready to retake full control at any time. Lane Keeping Assistance (LKA) Type II is a further example of Level 1 self-driving. Automatic emergency braking which alerts the driver to a crash and permits full braking capacity is also a Level 1 feature, according to Autopilot Review magazine. [77]\n\nmagazine. Level 2 (""hands off""): The automated system takes full control of the vehicle: accelerating, braking, and steering. The driver must monitor the driving and be prepared to intervene immediately at any time if the automated system fails to respond properly. The shorthand ""hands off"" is not meant to be taken literally \xe2\x80\x93 contact between hand and wheel is often mandatory during SAE 2 driving, to confirm that the driver is ready to intervene. The eyes of the driver might be monitored by cameras to confirm that the driver is keeping their attention to traffic. Literal hands off driving is considered level 2.5, although there is no half levels officially. A common example is adaptive cruise control which also utilizes lane keeping assist technology so that the driver simply monitors the vehicle, such as ""Super-Cruise"" in the Cadillac CT6 by General Motors or Ford\'s F-150 BlueCruise. [78]\n\nLevel 3 (""eyes off""): The driver can safely turn their attention away from the driving tasks, e.g. the driver can text or watch a movie. The vehicle will handle situations that call for an immediate response, like emergency braking. The driver must still be prepared to intervene within some limited time, specified by the manufacturer, when called upon by the vehicle to do so. You can think of the automated system as a co-driver that will alert you in an orderly fashion when it is your turn to drive. An example would be a Traffic Jam Chauffeur, [79] another example would be a car satisfying the international Automated Lane Keeping System (ALKS) regulations. [80]\n\nanother example would be a car satisfying the international Automated Lane Keeping System (ALKS) regulations. Level 4 (""mind off""): As level 3, but no driver attention is ever required for safety, e.g. the driver may safely go to sleep or leave the driver\'s seat. However, self-driving is supported only in limited spatial areas (geofenced) or under special circumstances. Outside of these areas or circumstances, the vehicle must be able to safely abort the trip, e.g. slow down and park the car, if the driver does not retake control. An example would be a robotic taxi or a robotic delivery service that covers selected locations in an area, at a specific time and quantities.\n\nLevel 5 (""steering wheel optional""): No human intervention is required at all. An example would be a robotic vehicle that works on all kinds of surfaces, all over the world, all year around, in all weather conditions.\n\nIn the formal SAE definition below, an important transition is from SAE Level 2 to SAE Level 3 in which the human driver is no longer expected to monitor the environment continuously. At SAE 3, the human driver still has responsibility to intervene when asked to do so by the automated system. At SAE 4 the human driver is always relieved of that responsibility and at SAE 5 the automated system will never need to ask for an intervention.\n\nSAE (J3016) Automation Levels[76] SAE Level Name Narrative definition Execution of\n\nsteering and\n\nacceleration/\n\ndeceleration Monitoring of driving environment Fallback performance of dynamic driving task System capability (driving modes) Human driver monitors the driving environment 0 No Automation The full-time performance by the human driver of all aspects of the dynamic driving task, even when ""enhanced by warning or intervention systems"" Human driver Human driver Human driver n/a 1 Driver Assistance The driving mode-specific execution by a driver assistance system of ""either steering or acceleration/deceleration"" using information about the driving environment and with the expectation that the human driver performs all remaining aspects of the dynamic driving task Human driver and system Some driving modes 2 Partial Automation The driving mode-specific execution by one or more driver assistance systems of both steering and acceleration/deceleration System Automated driving system monitors the driving environment 3 Conditional Automation The driving mode-specific performance by an automated driving system of all aspects of the dynamic driving task with the expectation that the human driver will respond appropriately to a request to intervene System System Human driver Some driving modes 4 High Automation even if a human driver does not respond appropriately to a request to intervene the car can pull over safely by guiding system System Many driving modes 5 Full Automation under all roadway and environmental conditions that can be managed by a human driver All driving modes\n\nCriticism of SAE [ edit ]\n\nThe SAE Automation Levels have been criticized for their technological focus. It has been argued that the structure of the levels suggests that automation increases linearly and that more automation is better, which may not always be the case.[81] The SAE Levels also do not account for changes that may be required to infrastructure[82] and road user behavior.[83][84]\n\nTechnology [ edit ]\n\nThe characteristics of autonomous vehicles, as digital technology, are distinguishable from other types of technologies and vehicles. These characteristics mean autonomous vehicles are able to be more transformative and agile to possible changes. The characteristics include hybrid navigation, homogenization and decoupling, vehicle communication systems, reprogrammable and smart, digital traces and modularity.\n\nHybrid navigation [ edit ]\n\nThere are different systems that help the self-driving car control the car, including the car navigation system, the location system, the electronic map, the map matching, the global path planning, the environment perception, the laser perception, the radar perception, the visual perception, the vehicle control, the perception of vehicle speed and direction, and the vehicle control method.[85]\n\nDriverless car designers are challenged with producing control systems capable of analyzing sensory data in order to provide accurate detection of other vehicles and the road ahead.[86] Modern self-driving cars generally use Bayesian simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms,[87] which fuse data from multiple sensors and an off-line map into current location estimates and map updates. Waymo has developed a variant of SLAM with detection and tracking of other moving objects (DATMO), which also handles obstacles such as cars and pedestrians. Simpler systems may use roadside real-time locating system (RTLS) technologies to aid localization. Typical sensors include lidar (Light Detection and Ranging), stereo vision, GPS and IMU.[88][89] Control systems on automated cars may use Sensor Fusion, which is an approach that integrates information from a variety of sensors on the car to produce a more consistent, accurate, and useful view of the environment.[90] Heavy rainfall, hail, or snow could impede the car sensors.[citation needed]\n\nDriverless vehicles require some form of machine vision for the purpose of visual object recognition. Automated cars are being developed with deep neural networks,[88] a type of deep learning architecture with many computational stages, or levels, in which neurons are simulated from the environment that activate the network.[91] The neural network depends on an extensive amount of data extracted from real-life driving scenarios,[88] enabling the neural network to ""learn"" how to execute the best course of action.[91]\n\nIn May 2018, researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology announced that they had built an automated car that can navigate unmapped roads.[92] Researchers at their Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) have developed a new system, called MapLite, which allows self-driving cars to drive on roads that they have never been on before, without using 3D maps. The system combines the GPS position of the vehicle, a ""sparse topological map"" such as OpenStreetMap, (i.e. having 2D features of the roads only), and a series of sensors that observe the road conditions.[93]\n\nHomogenization and decoupling [ edit ]\n\nHomogenization indicates the fact that all digital information assumes the same form. During the ongoing evolution of the digital era, certain industry standards have been developed on how to store digital information and in what type of format. This concept of homogenization also applies to autonomous vehicles. In order for autonomous vehicles to perceive their surroundings, they have to use different techniques each with their own accompanying digital information (e.g. radar, GPS, motion sensors and computer vision). Homogenization requires that the digital information from these different sources is transmitted and stored in the same form. This means their differences are decoupled, and digital information can be transmitted, stored, and computed in a way that the vehicles and their operating system can better understand and act upon it. Homogenization also helps to take advantage of the exponential increase of the computing power of hardware and software (Moore\'s law) which also supports the autonomous vehicles to understand and act upon the digital information in a more cost-effective way, therefore lowering the marginal costs.[citation needed]\n\nVehicle communication systems [ edit ]\n\nIndividual vehicles can benefit from information obtained from other vehicles in the vicinity, especially information relating to traffic congestion and safety hazards. Vehicular communication systems use vehicles and roadside units as the communicating nodes in a peer-to-peer network, providing each other with information. As a cooperative approach, vehicular communication systems can allow all cooperating vehicles to be more effective. According to a 2010 study by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, vehicular communication systems could help avoid up to 79% of all traffic accidents.[94]\n\nThere have so far been no complete implementation of peer-to-peer networking on the scale required for traffic.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2012, computer scientists at the University of Texas in Austin began developing smart intersections designed for automated cars. The intersections will have no traffic lights and no stop signs, instead using computer programs that will communicate directly with each car on the road.[95] In the case of autonomous vehicles, it is essential for them to connect with other \'devices\' in order to function most effectively. Autonomous vehicles are equipped with communication systems which allow them to communicate with other autonomous vehicles and roadside units to provide them, amongst other things, with information about road work or traffic congestion. In addition, scientists believe that the future will have computer programs that connect and manage each individual autonomous vehicle as it navigates through an intersection. This type of connectivity must replace traffic lights and stop signs.[95] These types of characteristics drive and further develop the ability of autonomous vehicles to understand and cooperate with other products and services (such as intersection computer systems) in the autonomous vehicles market. This could lead to a network of autonomous vehicles all using the same network and information available on that network. Eventually, this can lead to more autonomous vehicles using the network because the information has been validated through the usage of other autonomous vehicles. Such movements will strengthen the value of the network and is called network externalities.\n\nAmong connected cars, an unconnected one is the weakest and will be increasingly banned from busy high-speed roads, as predicted by the Helsinki think tank, Nordic Communications Corporation, in January 2016.[96]\n\nIn 2017, Researchers from Arizona State University developed a 1/10 scale intersection and proposed an intersection management technique called Crossroads. It was shown that Crossroads is very resilient to network delay of both V2I communication and Worst-case Execution time of the intersection manager.[97] In 2018, a robust approach was introduced which is resilient to both model mismatch and external disturbances such as wind and bumps.[98]\n\nVehicle networking may be desirable due to difficulty with computer vision being able to recognize brake lights, turn signals, buses, and similar things. However, the usefulness of such systems would be diminished by the fact current cars are not equipped with them; they may also pose privacy concerns.[99]\n\nReprogrammable [ edit ]\n\nAnother characteristic of autonomous vehicles is that the core product will have a greater emphasis on the software and its possibilities, instead of the chassis and its engine. This is because autonomous vehicles have software systems that drive the vehicle, meaning that updates through reprogramming or editing the software can enhance the benefits of the owner (e.g. update in better distinguishing blind person vs. non-blind person so that the vehicle will take extra caution when approaching a blind person). A characteristic of this reprogrammable part of autonomous vehicles is that the updates need not only to come from the supplier, because through machine learning, smart autonomous vehicles can generate certain updates and install them accordingly (e.g. new navigation maps or new intersection computer systems). These reprogrammable characteristics of the digital technology and the possibility of smart machine learning give manufacturers of autonomous vehicles the opportunity to differentiate themselves on software. This also implies that autonomous vehicles are never finished because the product can continuously be improved.[citation needed]\n\nDigital traces [ edit ]\n\nAutonomous vehicles are equipped with different sorts of sensors and radars. As said, this allows them to connect and interoperate with computers from other autonomous vehicles and/or roadside units. This implies that autonomous vehicles leave digital traces when they connect or interoperate. The data that comes from these digital traces can be used to develop new (to be determined) products or updates to enhance autonomous vehicles\' driving ability or safety.[citation needed]\n\nModularity [ edit ]\n\nTraditional vehicles and their accompanying technologies are manufactured as a product that will be complete, and unlike autonomous vehicles, they can only be improved if they are redesigned or reproduced. As said, autonomous vehicles are produced but due to their digital characteristics never finished. This is because autonomous vehicles are more modular since they are made up out of several modules which will be explained hereafter through a Layered Modular Architecture. The Layered Modular Architecture extends the architecture of purely physical vehicles by incorporating four loosely coupled layers of devices, networks, services and contents into Autonomous Vehicles. These loosely coupled layers can interact through certain standardized interfaces.\n\n(1) The first layer of this architecture consists of the device layer. This layer consists of the following two parts: logical capability and physical machinery. The physical machinery refers to the actual vehicle itself (e.g. chassis and carrosserie). When it comes to digital technologies, the physical machinery is accompanied by a logical capability layer in the form of operating systems that helps to guide the vehicles itself and make it autonomous. The logical capability provides control over the vehicle and connects it with the other layers.;\n\n(2) On top of the device layer comes the network layer. This layer also consists of two different parts: physical transport and logical transmission. The physical transport layer refers to the radars, sensors and cables of the autonomous vehicles which enable the transmission of digital information. Next to that, the network layer of autonomous vehicles also has a logical transmission which contains communication protocols and network standard to communicate the digital information with other networks and platforms or between layers. This increases the accessibility of the autonomous vehicles and enables the computational power of a network or platform.;\n\n(3) The service layer contains the applications and their functionalities that serves the autonomous vehicle (and its owners) as they extract, create, store and consume content with regards to their own driving history, traffic congestion, roads or parking abilities for example.; and\n\n(4) The final layer of the model is the contents layer. This layer contains the sounds, images and videos. The autonomous vehicles store, extract and use to act upon and improve their driving and understanding of the environment. The contents layer also provides metadata and directory information about the content\'s origin, ownership, copyright, encoding methods, content tags, geo-time stamps, and so on (Yoo et al., 2010).\n\nThe consequence of layered modular architecture of autonomous vehicles (and other digital technologies) is that it enables the emergence and development of platforms and ecosystems around a product and/or certain modules of that product. Traditionally, automotive vehicles were developed, manufactured and maintained by traditional manufacturers. Nowadays app developers and content creators can help to develop more comprehensive product experience for the consumers which creates a platform around the product of autonomous vehicles.\n\nChallenges [ edit ]\n\nThe potential benefits from increased vehicle automation described may be limited by foreseeable challenges such as disputes over liability,[100][101] the time needed to turn over the existing stock of vehicles from non-automated to automated,[102] and thus a long period of humans and autonomous vehicles sharing the roads, resistance by individuals to forfeiting control of their cars,[103] concerns about safety,[104] and the implementation of a legal framework and consistent global government regulations for self-driving cars.[105]\n\nOther obstacles could include de-skilling and lower levels of driver experience for dealing with potentially dangerous situations and anomalies,[106] ethical problems where an automated vehicle\'s software is forced during an unavoidable crash to choose between multiple harmful courses of action (\'the trolley problem\'),[107][108] concerns about making large numbers of people currently employed as drivers unemployed, the potential for more intrusive mass surveillance of location, association and travel as a result of police and intelligence agency access to large data sets generated by sensors and pattern-recognition AI, and possibly insufficient understanding of verbal sounds, gestures and non-verbal cues by police, other drivers or pedestrians.[109]\n\nAutonomous delivery vehicles stuck in one place by attempting to avoid one another.\n\nPossible technological obstacles for automated cars are:\n\nArtificial Intelligence is still not able to function properly in chaotic inner-city environments. [110]\n\nA car\'s computer could potentially be compromised, as could a communication system between cars. [111] [112] [113] [114] [115]\n\nSusceptibility of the car\'s sensing and navigation systems to different types of weather (such as snow) or deliberate interference, including jamming and spoofing. [109]\n\nAvoidance of large animals requires recognition and tracking, and Volvo found that software suited to caribou, deer, and elk was ineffective with kangaroos. [116]\n\nAutonomous cars may require high-definition maps to operate properly. Where these maps may be out of date, they would need to be able to fall back to reasonable behaviors.\n\nCompetition for the radio spectrum desired for the car\'s communication. [117]\n\nField programmability for the systems will require careful evaluation of product development and the component supply chain. [115]\n\nCurrent road infrastructure may need changes for automated cars to function optimally. [118]\n\nValidation challenge of Automated Driving and need for novel simulation-based approaches comprising digital twins and agent-based traffic simulation.[119]\n\nSocial challenges include:\n\nUncertainty about potential future regulation may delay deployment of automated cars on the road. [120]\n\nEmployment \xe2\x80\x93 Companies working on the technology have an increasing recruitment problem in that the available talent pool has not grown with demand.[121] As such, education and training by third-party organizations such as providers of online courses and self-taught community-driven projects such as DIY Robocars[122] and Formula Pi have quickly grown in popularity, while university level extra-curricular programmes such as Formula Student Driverless[123] have bolstered graduate experience. Industry is steadily increasing freely available information sources, such as code,[124] datasets[125] and glossaries[126] to widen the recruitment pool.\n\nHuman factor [ edit ]\n\nSelf-driving cars are already exploring the difficulties of determining the intentions of pedestrians, bicyclists, and animals, and models of behavior must be programmed into driving algorithms.[8] Human road users also have the challenge of determining the intentions of autonomous vehicles, where there is no driver with which to make eye contact or exchange hand signals. Drive.ai is testing a solution to this problem that involves LED signs mounted on the outside of the vehicle, announcing status such as ""going now, don\'t cross"" vs. ""waiting for you to cross"".[127]\n\nTwo human-factor challenges are important for safety. One is the handoff from automated driving to manual driving, which may become necessary due to unfavorable or unusual road conditions, or if the vehicle has limited capabilities. A sudden handoff could leave a human driver dangerously unprepared in the moment. In the long term, humans who have less practice at driving might have a lower skill level and thus be more dangerous in manual mode. The second challenge is known as risk compensation: as a system is perceived to be safer, instead of benefiting entirely from all of the increased safety, people engage in riskier behavior and enjoy other benefits. Semi-automated cars have been shown to suffer from this problem, for example with users of Tesla Autopilot ignoring the road and using electronic devices or other activities against the advice of the company that the car is not capable of being completely autonomous. In the near future, pedestrians and bicyclists may travel in the street in a riskier fashion if they believe self-driving cars are capable of avoiding them.\n\nIn order for people to buy self-driving cars and vote for the government to allow them on roads, the technology must be trusted as safe.[128][129] Self-driving elevators were invented in 1900, but the high number of people refusing to use them slowed adoption for several decades until operator strikes increased demand and trust was built with advertising and features like the emergency stop button.[130][131] There are three types of trust between human and automation.[132] There is dispositional trust, the trust between the driver and the company\'s product.[132] Situational trust, or the trust from different scenarios.[132] Finally there is learned trust where the trust is built between similar events.[132]\n\nMoral issues [ edit ]\n\nWith the emergence of automated automobiles, various ethical issues arise. While the introduction of automated vehicles to the mass market is said to be inevitable due to a presumed but untestable potential for reduction of crashes by ""up to"" 90%[133] and their potential greater accessibility to disabled, elderly, and young passengers, a range of ethical issues have been posed. Those include, but are not limited to:\n\nThe moral, financial, and criminal responsibility for crashes and breaches of law\n\nThe decisions a car is to make right before a potentially fatal crash\n\nPrivacy issues, including the potential for mass surveillance\n\nPotential for massive job losses and unemployment among drivers\n\nDe-skilling and loss of independence by vehicle users\n\nExposure to hacking and malware\n\nThe further concentration of market and data power in the hands of a few global conglomerates capable of consolidating AI capacity and of lobbying governments to facilitate the shift of liability onto others and their potential destruction of existing occupations and industries.\n\nThere are different opinions on who should be held liable in case of a crash, especially with people being hurt. Many experts see the car manufacturers themselves being responsible for those crashes that occur due to a technical malfunction or misconstruction.[134] Besides the fact that the car manufacturer would be the source of the problem in a situation where a car crashes due to a technical issue, there is another important reason why car manufacturers could be held responsible: it would encourage them to innovate and heavily invest into fixing those issues, not only due to protection of the brand image, but also due to financial and criminal consequences. However, there are also voices[who?] that argue those using or owning the vehicle should be held responsible since they know the risks involved in using such a vehicle. One study suggests requesting the owners of self-driving cars to sign end-user license agreements (EULAs), assigning to them accountability for any accidents.[135] Other studies suggest introducing a tax or insurances that would protect owners and users of automated vehicles of claims made by victims of an accident.[134] Other possible parties that can be held responsible in case of a technical failure include software engineers that programmed the code for the automated operation of the vehicles, and suppliers of components of the AV.[136]\n\nTaking aside the question of legal liability and moral responsibility, the question arises how automated vehicles should be programmed to behave in an emergency situation where either passengers or other traffic participants like pedestrians, bicyclists and other drivers are endangered. A moral dilemma that a software engineer or car manufacturer might face in programming the operating software is described in an ethical thought experiment, the trolley problem: a conductor of a trolley has the choice of staying on the planned track and running over five people, or turn the trolley onto a track where it would kill only one person, assuming there is no traffic on it.[137] When a self-driving car is in following scenario: it\'s driving with passengers and suddenly a person appears in its way. The car has to decide between the two options, either to run the person over or to avoid hitting the person by swerving into a wall, killing the passengers.[138] There are two main considerations that need to be addressed. First, what moral basis would be used by an automated vehicle to make decisions? Second, how could those be translated into software code? Researchers have suggested, in particular, two ethical theories to be applicable to the behavior of automated vehicles in cases of emergency: deontology and utilitarianism.[8][139] Asimov\'s Three Laws of Robotics are a typical example of deontological ethics. The theory suggests that an automated car needs to follow strict written-out rules that it needs to follow in any situation. Utilitarianism suggests the idea that any decision must be made based on the goal to maximize utility. This needs a definition of utility which could be maximizing the number of people surviving in a crash. Critics suggest that automated vehicles should adapt a mix of multiple theories to be able to respond morally right in the instance of a crash.[8][139] Recently, some specific ethical frameworks i.e., utilitarianism, deontology, relativism, absolutism (monism), and pluralism, are investigated empirically with respect to the acceptance of self-driving cars in unavoidable accidents.[140]\n\nMany \'trolley\' discussions skip over the practical problems of how a probabilistic machine learning vehicle AI could be sophisticated enough to understand that a deep problem of moral philosophy is presenting itself from instant to instant while using a dynamic projection into the near future, what sort of moral problem it actually would be if any, what the relevant weightings in human value terms should be given to all the other humans involved who will be probably unreliably identified, and how reliably it can assess the probable outcomes. These practical difficulties, and those around testing and assessment of solutions to them, may present as much of a challenge as the theoretical abstractions.[141]\n\nWhile most trolley conundrums involve hyperbolic and unlikely fact patterns, it is inevitable mundane ethical decisions and risk calculations such as the precise millisecond a car should yield to a yellow light or how closely to drive to a bike lane will need to be programmed into the software of autonomous vehicles.[8][142] Mundane ethical situations may even be more relevant than rare fatal circumstances because of the specificity implicated and their large scope.[142] Mundane situations involving drivers and pedestrians are so prevalent that, in the aggregate, produce large amounts of injuries and deaths.[142] Hence, even incremental permutations of moral algorithms can have a notable effect when considered in their entirety.[142]\n\nPrivacy-related issues arise mainly from the interconnectivity of automated cars, making it just another mobile device that can gather any information about an individual (see data mining). This information gathering ranges from tracking of the routes taken, voice recording, video recording, preferences in media that is consumed in the car, behavioral patterns, to many more streams of information.[99][143][144] The data and communications infrastructure needed to support these vehicles may also be capable of surveillance, especially if coupled to other data sets and advanced analytics.[99]\n\nThe implementation of automated vehicles to the mass market might cost up to 5 million jobs in the US alone, making up almost 3% of the workforce.[145] Those jobs include drivers of taxis, buses, vans, trucks, and e-hailing vehicles. Many industries, such as the auto insurance industry are indirectly affected. This industry alone generates an annual revenue of about US$220 billion, supporting 277,000 jobs.[146] To put this into perspective\xe2\x80\x93this is about the number of mechanical engineering jobs.[147] The potential loss of a majority of those jobs will have a tremendous impact on those individuals involved.[148]\n\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has animated the trolley problem in the context of autonomous cars in a website called The Moral Machine.[149] The Moral Machine generates random scenarios in which autonomous cars malfunction and forces the user to choose between two harmful courses of action.[149] MIT\'s Moral Machine experiment has collected data involving over 40 million decisions from people in 233 countries to ascertain peoples\' moral preferences. The MIT study illuminates that ethical preferences vary among cultures and demographics and likely correlate with modern institutions and geographic traits.[149]\n\nGlobal trends of the MIT study highlight that, overall, people prefer to save the lives of humans over other animals, prioritize the lives of many rather than few, and spare the lives of young rather than old.[149] Men are slightly more likely to spare the lives of women, and religious affiliates are slightly more likely to prioritize human life. The lives of criminals were prioritized more than cats, but the lives of dogs were prioritized more than the lives of criminals.[150] The lives of homeless were spared more than the elderly, but the lives of homeless were spared less often than the obese.[150]\n\nPeople overwhelmingly express a preference for autonomous vehicles to be programmed with utilitarian ideas, that is, in a manner that generates the least harm and minimizes driving casualties.[151] While people want others to purchase utilitarian promoting vehicles, they themselves prefer to ride in vehicles that prioritize the lives of people inside the vehicle at all costs.[151] This presents a paradox in which people prefer that others drive utilitarian vehicles designed to maximize the lives preserved in a fatal situation but want to ride in cars that prioritize the safety of passengers at all costs.[151] People disapprove of regulations that promote utilitarian views and would be less willing to purchase a self-driving car that may opt to promote the greatest good at the expense of its passengers.[151]\n\nBonnefon et al. conclude that the regulation of autonomous vehicle ethical prescriptions may be counterproductive to societal safety.[151] This is because, if the government mandates utilitarian ethics and people prefer to ride in self-protective cars, it could prevent the large scale implementation of self-driving cars.[151] Delaying the adoption of autonomous cars vitiates the safety of society as a whole because this technology is projected to save so many lives.[151] This is a paradigmatic example of the tragedy of the commons, in which rational actors cater to their self-interested preferences at the expense of societal utility.[152]\n\nTesting [ edit ]\n\nTo make a car 95% as safe as an experienced driver, 275 million failure-free autonomous miles (400 M km) are needed while several billions miles (or kilometers) are needed to make them 10% or 20% safer than humans.[153]\n\nThe testing of vehicles with varying degrees of automation can be carried out either physically, in a closed environment[154] or, where permitted, on public roads (typically requiring a license or permit,[155] or adhering to a specific set of operating principles),[156] or in a virtual environment, i.e. using computer simulations.[157][158] When driven on public roads, automated vehicles require a person to monitor their proper operation and ""take over"" when needed. For example, New York state has strict requirements for the test driver, such that the vehicle can be corrected at all times by a licensed operator; highlighted by Cardian Cube Company\'s application and discussions with New York State officials and the NYS DMV.[159]\n\nApple is testing self-driving cars, and has increased its fleet of test vehicles from three in April 2017, to 27 in January 2018, and 45 by March 2018.[160][161]\n\nRussian internet-company Yandex started to develop self-driving cars in early 2017. The first driverless prototype was launched in May 2017. In November 2017, Yandex released a video of its AV winter tests.[162] The car drove successfully along snowy roads of Moscow. In June 2018, Yandex self-driving vehicle completed a 485-mile (780 km) trip on a federal highway from Moscow to Kazan in autonomous mode.[163][164] In August 2018, Yandex launched a Europe\'s first robotaxi service with no human driver behind the wheel in the Russian town of Innopolis.[165] At the beginning of 2020 it was reported that over 5,000 autonomous passenger rides were made in the city.[166] At the end of 2018, Yandex obtained a license to operate autonomous vehicles on public roads in the U.S. state of Nevada. In 2019 and 2020, Yandex cars carried out demo rides for Consumer Electronic Show visitors in Las Vegas. Yandex cars were circulating the streets of the city without any human control.[167][168] In 2019 Yandex started testing its self-driving cars on the public roads of Israel.[169] In October 2019, Yandex became one of the companies selected by Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) to provide autonomous passenger rides to the visitors of Detroit Autoshow 2020.[170] At the end of 2019, Yandex made an announcement its self-driving cars passed 1 million miles in fully autonomous mode in Russia, Israel, and the United States.[171] In February 2020, Yandex doubled its mileage with 2 million miles passed.[172] In 2020, Yandex started to test its self-driving cars in Michigan.[173]\n\nThe progress of automated vehicles can be assessed by computing the average distance driven between ""disengagements"", when the automated system is switched off, typically by the intervention of a human driver. In 2017, Waymo reported 63 disengagements over 352,545 mi (567,366 km) of testing, an average distance of 5,596 mi (9,006 km) between disengagements, the highest among companies reporting such figures. Waymo also traveled a greater total distance than any of the other companies. Their 2017 rate of 0.18 disengagements per 1,000 mi (1,600 km) was an improvement over the 0.2 disengagements per 1,000 mi (1,600 km) in 2016, and 0.8 in 2015. In March 2017, Uber reported an average of just 0.67 mi (1.08 km) per disengagement. In the final three months of 2017, Cruise (now owned by GM) averaged 5,224 mi (8,407 km) per disengagement over a total distance of 62,689 mi (100,888 km).[174] In July 2018, the first electric driverless racing car, ""Robocar"", completed a 1.8-kilometer track, using its navigation system and artificial intelligence.[175]\n\nDistance between disengagement and total distance traveled autonomously Car maker California, 2016[174] California, 2018[176] California, 2019[177] Distance between\n\ndisengagements Total distance traveled Distance between\n\ndisengagements Total distance traveled Distance between\n\ndisengagements Total distance traveled Waymo 5,128 mi (8,253 km) 635,868 mi (1,023,330 km) 11,154 mi (17,951 km) 1,271,587 mi (2,046,421 km) 11,017 mi (17,730 km) 1,450,000 mi (2,330,000 km) BMW 638 mi (1,027 km) 638 mi (1,027 km) Nissan 263 mi (423 km) 6,056 mi (9,746 km) 210 mi (340 km) 5,473 mi (8,808 km) Ford 197 mi (317 km) 590 mi (950 km) General Motors 55 mi (89 km) 8,156 mi (13,126 km) 5,205 mi (8,377 km) 447,621 mi (720,376 km) 12,221 mi (19,668 km) 831,040 mi (1,337,430 km) Delphi Automotive Systems 15 mi (24 km) 2,658 mi (4,278 km) Tesla 3 mi (4.8 km) 550 mi (890 km) Mercedes-Benz 2 mi (3.2 km) 673 mi (1,083 km) 1.5 mi (2.4 km) 1,749 mi (2,815 km) Bosch 7 mi (11 km) 983 mi (1,582 km) Zoox 1,923 mi (3,095 km) 30,764 mi (49,510 km) 1,595 mi (2,567 km) 67,015 mi (107,850 km) Nuro 1,028 mi (1,654 km) 24,680 mi (39,720 km) 2,022 mi (3,254 km) 68,762 mi (110,662 km) Pony.ai 1,022 mi (1,645 km) 16,356 mi (26,322 km) 6,476 mi (10,422 km) 174,845 mi (281,386 km) Baidu (Apolong) 206 mi (332 km) 18,093 mi (29,118 km) 18,050 mi (29,050 km) 108,300 mi (174,300 km) Aurora 100 mi (160 km) 32,858 mi (52,880 km) 280 mi (450 km) 39,729 mi (63,938 km) Apple 1.1 mi (1.8 km) 79,745 mi (128,337 km) 118 mi (190 km) 7,544 mi (12,141 km) Uber 0.4 mi (0.64 km) 26,899 mi (43,290 km) 0 mi (0 km)\n\nApplications [ edit ]\n\nAutonomous trucks and vans [ edit ]\n\nCompanies such as Otto and Starsky Robotics have focused on autonomous trucks. Automation of trucks is important, not only due to the improved safety aspects of these very heavy vehicles, but also due to the ability of fuel savings through platooning. Autonomous vans are being used by online grocers such as Ocado.[citation needed]\n\nResearch has also indicated that goods distribution on the macro (urban distribution) and micro level (last mile delivery) could be made more efficient with the use of autonomous vehicles [178] thanks to the possibility of smaller vehicle sizes.\n\nTransport systems [ edit ]\n\nChina trialed the first automated public bus in Henan province in 2015, on a highway linking Zhengzhou and Kaifeng.[179][180] Baidu and King Long produce automated minibus, a vehicle with 14 seats, but without driving seat. With 100 vehicles produced, 2018 will be the first year with commercial automated service in China.[181][182]\n\nIn Europe, cities in Belgium, France, Italy and the UK are planning to operate transport systems for automated cars,[183][184][185] and Germany, the Netherlands, and Spain have allowed public testing in traffic. In 2015, the UK launched public trials of the LUTZ Pathfinder automated pod in Milton Keynes.[186] Beginning in summer 2015, the French government allowed PSA Peugeot-Citroen to make trials in real conditions in the Paris area. The experiments were planned to be extended to other cities such as Bordeaux and Strasbourg by 2016.[187] The alliance between French companies THALES and Valeo (provider of the first self-parking car system that equips Audi and Mercedes premi) is testing its own system.[188] New Zealand is planning to use automated vehicles for public transport in Tauranga and Christchurch.[189][190][191][192]\n\nImpact [ edit ]\n\nAutomobile industry [ edit ]\n\nThe traditional automobile industry is subject to changes driven by technology and market demands. These changes include breakthrough technological advances and when the market demands and adopts new technology quickly. In the rapid advance of both factors, the end of the era of incremental change was recognized. When the transition is made to new technology, new entrants to the automotive industry present themselves, which can be distinguished as mobility providers such as Uber and Lyft, as well as tech giants such as Google and Nvidia.[193] As new entrants to the industry arise, market uncertainty naturally occurs due to the changing dynamics. For example, the entrance of tech giants, as well as the alliances between them and traditional car manufacturers causes a variation in the innovation and production process of autonomous vehicles. Additionally, the entrance of mobility providers has caused ambiguous user preferences. As a result of the rise of mobility providers, the number of vehicles per capita has flatlined. In addition, the rise of the sharing economy also contributes to market uncertainty and causes forecasters to question whether personal ownership of vehicles is still relevant as new transportation technology and mobility providers are becoming preferred among consumers.\n\nTo help reduce the possibility of safety issues, some companies have begun to open-source parts of their driverless systems. Udacity for instance is developing an open-source software stack,[194] and some companies are having similar approaches.[195][196]\n\nHealth [ edit ]\n\nAccording to a 2020 Annual Review of Public Health review of the literature, self-driving cars ""could increase some health risks (such as air pollution, noise, and sedentarism); however, if properly regulated, AVs will likely reduce morbidity and mortality from motor vehicle crashes and may help reshape cities to promote healthy urban environments.""[197] Driving safety experts predict that once driverless technology has been fully developed, traffic collisions (and resulting deaths and injuries and costs) caused by human error, such as delayed reaction time, tailgating, rubbernecking, and other forms of distracted or aggressive driving should be substantially reduced.[1][198][199][200][201] With the increasing reliance of autonomous vehicles on interconnectivity and the availability of big data which is made usable in the form of real-time maps, driving decisions can be made much faster in order to prevent collisions.[8]\n\nNumbers made available by the US government state that 94% of vehicle accidents are due to human failures.[202] As a result, major implications for the healthcare industry become apparent. Numbers from the National Safety Council on killed and injured people on US roads multiplied by the average costs of a single incident reveal that an estimated US$500 billion loss may be imminent for the US healthcare industry when autonomous vehicles are dominating the roads. It is likely the anticipated decrease in traffic accidents will positively contribute to the widespread acceptance of autonomous vehicles, as well as the possibility to better allocate healthcare resources. If 90% of cars in the US became self-driving, for example, an estimated 25,000 lives would be saved annually. Lives saved by averting automobile crashes in the US has been valued at more than $200 billion annually.[197]\n\nSelf-driving car would have the potential to save 10 million lives worldwide, per decade.[203][197]\n\nAccording to motorist website ""TheDrive.com"" operated by Time magazine, none of the driving safety experts they were able to contact was able to rank driving under an autopilot system at the time (2017) as having achieved a greater level of safety than traditional fully hands-on driving, so the degree to which these benefits asserted by proponents will manifest in practice cannot be assessed.[204] Confounding factors that could reduce the net effect on safety may include unexpected interactions between humans and partly or fully automated vehicles, or between different types of a vehicle system; complications at the boundaries of functionality at each automation level (such as handover when the vehicle reaches the limit of its capacity); the effect of the bugs and flaws that inevitably occur in complex interdependent software systems; sensor or data shortcomings; and successful compromise by malicious interveners. Security problems include what an autonomous car might do if summoned to pick up the owner but another person attempts entry, what happens if someone tries to break into the car, and what happens if someone attacks the occupants, for example by exchanging gunfire.[205]\n\nSome[who?] believe that once automation in vehicles reaches higher levels and becomes reliable, drivers will pay less attention to the road.[206] Research shows that drivers in automated cars react later when they have to intervene in a critical situation, compared to if they were driving manually.[207] Depending on the capabilities of automated vehicles and the frequency with which human intervention is needed, this may counteract any increase in safety, as compared to all-human driving, that may be delivered by other factors.\n\nAn unexpected disadvantage of the widespread acceptance of autonomous vehicles would be a reduction in the supply of organs for donation.[208] In the US, for example, 13% of the organ donation supply comes from car crash victims.[197]\n\nWelfare [ edit ]\n\nAccording to a 2020 study, self-driving cars will increase productivity, and housing affordability, as well as reclaim land used for parking.[209] However, self-driving cars will cause greater energy use, traffic congestion and sprawl.[209] Automated cars could reduce labor costs;[210][211] relieve travelers from driving and navigation chores, thereby replacing behind-the-wheel commuting hours with more time for leisure or work;[198][201] and also would lift constraints on occupant ability to drive, distracted and texting while driving, intoxicated, prone to seizures, or otherwise impaired.[212][213][214]\n\nFor the young, the elderly, people with disabilities, and low-income citizens, automated cars could provide enhanced mobility.[215][216] The removal of the steering wheel\xe2\x80\x94along with the remaining driver interface and the requirement for any occupant to assume a forward-facing position\xe2\x80\x94would give the interior of the cabin greater ergonomic flexibility. Large vehicles, such as motorhomes, would attain appreciably enhanced ease of use.[217]\n\nThe elderly and persons with disabilities (such as persons who are hearing-impaired, vision-impaired, mobility-impaired, or cognitively-impaired) are potential beneficiaries of adoption of autonomous vehicles; however, the extent to which such populations gain greater mobility from the adoption of AV technology depends on the specific designs and regulations adopted.[218][219]\n\nChildren and teens, who are not able to drive a vehicle themselves in case of student transport, would also benefit of the introduction of autonomous cars.[220] Daycares and schools are able to come up with automated pick-up and drop-off systems by car in addition to walking, cycling and busing, causing a decrease of reliance on parents and childcare workers.\n\nThe extent to which human actions are necessary for driving will vanish. Since current vehicles require human actions to some extent, the driving school industry will not be disrupted until the majority of autonomous transportation is switched to the emerged dominant design. It is plausible that in the distant future driving a vehicle will be considered as a luxury, which implies that the structure of the industry is based on new entrants and a new market.[221] Self-driving cars would also exasperate existing mobility inequalities driven by the interests of car companies and technology companies while taking investment away from more equitable and sustainable mobility initiatives such as public transportation.[222]\n\nUrban planning [ edit ]\n\nAccording to a Wonkblog reporter, if fully automated cars become commercially available, they have the potential to be a disruptive innovation with major implications for society. The likelihood of widespread adoption is still unclear, but if they are used on a wide scale, policymakers face a number of unresolved questions about their effects.[118]\n\nOne fundamental question is about their effect on travel behavior. Some people believe that they will increase car ownership and car use because it will become easier to use them and they will ultimately be more useful.[118] This may, in turn, encourage urban sprawl and ultimately total private vehicle use. Others argue that it will be easier to share cars and that this will thus discourage outright ownership and decrease total usage, and make cars more efficient forms of transportation in relation to the present situation.[99][223]\n\nPolicy-makers will have to take a new look at how infrastructure is to be built and how money will be allotted to build for automated vehicles. The need for traffic signals could potentially be reduced with the adoption of smart highways.[224] Due to smart highways and with the assistance of smart technological advances implemented by policy change, the dependence on oil imports may be reduced because of less time being spent on the road by individual cars which could have an effect on policy regarding energy.[225] On the other hand, automated vehicles could increase the overall number of cars on the road which could lead to a greater dependence on oil imports if smart systems are not enough to curtail the impact of more vehicles.[226] However, due to the uncertainty of the future of automated vehicles, policymakers may want to plan effectively by implementing infrastructure improvements that can be beneficial to both human drivers and automated vehicles.[227] Caution needs to be taken in acknowledgment to public transportation and that the use may be greatly reduced if automated vehicles are catered to through policy reform of infrastructure with this resulting in job loss and increased unemployment.[228]\n\nOther disruptive effects will come from the use of automated vehicles to carry goods. Self-driving vans have the potential to make home deliveries significantly cheaper, transforming retail commerce and possibly making hypermarkets and supermarkets redundant. As of 2019 the US Department of Transportation defines automation into six levels, starting at level zero which means the human driver does everything and ending with level five, the automated system performs all the driving tasks. Also under the current law, manufacturers bear all the responsibility to self-certify vehicles for use on public roads. This means that currently as long as the vehicle is compliant within the regulatory framework, there are no specific federal legal barriers in the US to a highly automated vehicle being offered for sale. Iyad Rahwan, an associate professor in the MIT Media Lab said, ""Most people want to live in a world where cars will minimize casualties, but everyone wants their own car to protect them at all costs."" Furthermore, industry standards and best practice are still needed in systems before they can be considered reasonably safe under real-world conditions.[229]\n\nTraffic [ edit ]\n\nAdditional advantages could include higher speed limits;[230] smoother rides;[231] and increased roadway capacity; and minimized traffic congestion, due to decreased need for safety gaps and higher speeds.[232][233] Currently, maximum controlled-access highway throughput or capacity according to the US Highway Capacity Manual is about 2,200 passenger vehicles per hour per lane, with about 5% of the available road space is taken up by cars. One study estimated that automated cars could increase capacity by 273% (\xe2\x89\x888,200 cars per hour per lane). The study also estimated that with 100% connected vehicles using vehicle-to-vehicle communication, capacity could reach 12,000 passenger vehicles per hour (up 545% from 2,200 pc/h per lane) traveling safely at 120 km/h (75 mph) with a following gap of about 6 m (20 ft) of each other. Human drivers at highway speeds keep between 40 to 50 m (130 to 160 ft) away from the vehicle in front. These increases in highway capacity could have a significant impact in traffic congestion, particularly in urban areas, and even effectively end highway congestion in some places.[234] The ability for authorities to manage traffic flow would increase, given the extra data and driving behavior predictability[235] combined with less need for traffic police and even road signage.\n\nInsurance [ edit ]\n\nSafer driving is expected to reduce the costs of vehicle insurance.[210][236][failed verification] The automobile insurance industry might suffer as the technology makes certain aspects of these occupations obsolete.[216] As fewer collisions implicate less money spent on repair costs, the role of the insurance industry is likely to be altered as well. It can be expected that the increased safety of transport due to autonomous vehicles will lead to a decrease in payouts for the insurers, which is positive for the industry, but fewer payouts may imply a demand drop for insurances in general.\n\nIn order to accommodate such changes, the Automated and Electric Vehicles Act 2018 was introduced. While Part 2 deals with Electric Vehicles, Part 1 covers insurance provisions for automated vehicles.\n\nLabor market [ edit ]\n\nA direct impact of widespread adoption of automated vehicles is the loss of driving-related jobs in the road transport industry.[1][210][211][237] There could be resistance from professional drivers and unions who are threatened by job losses.[238] In addition, there could be job losses in public transit services and crash repair shops. A frequently cited paper by Michael Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey found that automated cars would make many jobs redundant.[239] The industry has, however created thousands of jobs in low-income countries for workers who train autonomous systems.[240]\n\nEnergy and environmental impacts [ edit ]\n\nVehicle use\n\nA review found that private autonomous vehicles may increase total travel, whereas autonomous buses may lead to reduced car use.[241]\n\nVehicle automation can improve fuel economy of the car by optimizing the drive cycle, as well as increasing congested traffic speeds by an estimated 8%-13%.[242][243] Reduced traffic congestion and the improvements in traffic flow due to widespread use of automated cars will translate into higher fuel efficiency, ranging from a 23%-39% increase, with the potential to further increase.[242][244] Additionally, self-driving cars will be able to accelerate and brake more efficiently, meaning higher fuel economy from reducing wasted energy typically associated with inefficient changes to speed. However, the improvement in vehicle energy efficiency does not necessarily translate to net reduction in energy consumption and positive environmental outcomes.\n\nAlongside the induced demand, there may also be a reduction in the use of more sustainable modes, such as public or active transport. It is expected that convenience of the automated vehicles encourages the consumers to travel more, and this induced demand may partially or fully offset the fuel efficiency improvement brought by automation.[243] Alongside the induced demand, there may also be a reduction in the use of more sustainable modes, such as public or active transport.[245] Overall, the consequences of vehicle automation on global energy demand and emissions are highly uncertain, and heavily depends on the combined effect of changes in consumer behavior, policy intervention, technological progress and vehicle technology.[243]\n\nProduction\n\nBy reducing the labor and other costs of mobility as a service, automated cars could reduce the number of cars that are individually owned, replaced by taxi/pooling and other car-sharing services.[246][247] This would also dramatically reduce the size of the automotive production industry, with corresponding environmental and economic effects.\n\nIndirect effects\n\nThe lack of stressful driving, more productive time during the trip, and the potential savings in travel time and cost could become an incentive to live far away from cities, where housing is cheaper, and work in the city\'s core, thus increasing travel distances and inducing more urban sprawl, raising energy consumption and enlarging the carbon footprint of urban travel.[243][248][249] There is also the risk that traffic congestion might increase, rather than decrease.[243][216] Appropriate public policies and regulations, such as zoning, pricing, and urban design are required to avoid the negative impacts of increased suburbanization and longer distance travel.[216][249]\n\nSince many autonomous vehicles are going to rely on electricity to operate, the demand for lithium batteries increases. Similarly, radar, sensors, lidar, and high-speed internet connectivity require higher auxiliary power from vehicles, which manifests as greater power draw from batteries.[243] The larger battery requirement causes a necessary increase in the supply of these type of batteries for the chemical industry. On the other hand, with the expected increase of battery-powered (autonomous) vehicles, the petroleum industry is expected to undergo a decline in demand. As this implication depends on the adoption rate of autonomous vehicles, it is unsure to what extent this implication will disrupt this particular industry. This transition phase of oil to electricity allows companies to explore whether there are business opportunities for them in the new energy ecosystem. In 2020, Mohan, Sripad, Vaishnav & Viswanathan at Carnegie Mellon University[250] found that the electricity consumption of all the automation technology, including sensors, computation, internet access as well as the increased drag from sensors causes up to a 15% impact on the range of an automated electric vehicle, therefore, implying that the larger battery requirement might not be as large as previously assumed.\n\nA study conducted by AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety found that drivers did not trust self-parking technology, even though the systems outperformed drivers with a backup camera. The study tested self-parking systems in a variety of vehicles (Lincoln MKC, Mercedes-Benz ML400 4Matic, Cadillac CTS-V Sport, BMW i3 and Jeep Cherokee Limited) and found that self-parking cars hit the curb 81% fewer times, used 47% fewer manoeuvres and parked 10% faster than drivers. Yet, only 25% of those surveyed said they would trust this technology.[251]\n\nParking space [ edit ]\n\nManually driven vehicles are reported to be used only 4\xe2\x80\x935% of the time, and being parked and unused for the remaining 95\xe2\x80\x9396% of the time.[252][253] Autonomous taxis could, on the other hand, be used continuously after they have reached their destination. This could dramatically reduce the need for parking space. For example, in Los Angeles a 2015 study found 14% of the land is used for parking alone, equivalent to some 1,702 hectares (4,210 acres).[254][255] This combined with the potential reduced need for road space due to improved traffic flow, could free up large amounts of land in urban areas, which could then be used for parks, recreational areas, buildings, among other uses; making cities more livable. Besides this, privately owned self-driving cars, also capable of self-parking would provide another advantage: the ability to drop off and pick up passengers even in places where parking is prohibited. This would benefit park and ride facilities.[256]\n\nPrivacy [ edit ]\n\nThe vehicles\' increased awareness could aid the police by reporting on illegal passenger behaviour, while possibly enabling other crimes, such as deliberately crashing into another vehicle or a pedestrian.[257] However, this may also lead to much-expanded mass surveillance if there is wide access granted to third parties to the large data sets generated.\n\nPrivacy could be an issue when having the vehicle\'s location and position integrated into an interface that other people have access to.[1][258] Moreover, they require a sensor-based infrastructure that would constitute an all-encompassing surveillance apparatus.[259] This gives the car manufacturers and other companies the data needed to understand the user\'s lifestyle and personal preferences.[260]\n\nTerrorist scenarios [ edit ]\n\nThere is the risk of terrorist attacks by automotive hacking through the sharing of information through V2V (Vehicle to Vehicle) and V2I (Vehicle to Infrastructure) protocols.[261][262][263] Self-driving cars could potentially be loaded with explosives and used as bombs.[264] According to legislation of US lawmakers, autonomous and self-driving vehicles should be equipped with defences against hacking.[265]\n\nTaxis [ edit ]\n\nWith the aforementioned ambiguous user preference regarding the personal ownership of autonomous vehicles, it is possible that the current mobility provider trend will continue as it rises in popularity. Established providers such as Uber and Lyft are already significantly present within the industry, and it is likely that new entrants will enter when business opportunities arise.[266]\n\nCar repair [ edit ]\n\nAs collisions are less likely to occur, and the risk for human errors is reduced significantly, the repair industry will face an enormous reduction of work that has to be done on the reparation of car frames. Meanwhile, as the generated data of the autonomous vehicle is likely to predict when certain replaceable parts are in need of maintenance, car owners and the repair industry will be able to proactively replace a part that will fail soon. This ""Asset Efficiency Service"" would implicate a productivity gain for the automotive repair industry.\n\nRescue, emergency response, and military [ edit ]\n\nThe technique used in autonomous driving also ensures life savings in other industries. The implementation of autonomous vehicles with rescue, emergency response, and military applications has already led to a decrease in deaths.[citation needed] Military personnel use autonomous vehicles to reach dangerous and remote places on earth to deliver fuel, food and general supplies and even rescue people. In addition, a future implication of adopting autonomous vehicles could lead to a reduction in deployed personnel, which will lead to a decrease in injuries, since the technological development allows autonomous vehicles to become more and more autonomous. Another future implication is the reduction of emergency drivers when autonomous vehicles are deployed as fire trucks or ambulances. An advantage could be the use of real-time traffic information and other generated data to determine and execute routes more efficiently than human drivers. The time savings can be invaluable in these situations.[267]\n\nInterior design and entertainment [ edit ]\n\nWith the driver decreasingly focused on operating a vehicle, the interior design and media-entertainment industry will have to reconsider what passengers of autonomous vehicles are doing when they are on the road. Vehicles need to be redesigned, and possibly even be prepared for multipurpose usage. In practice, it will show that travellers have more time for business and/or leisure. In both cases, this gives increasing opportunities for the media-entertainment industry to demand attention. Moreover, the advertisement business is able to provide location-based ads without risking driver safety.[268]\n\nTelecommunication [ edit ]\n\nAll cars can benefit from information and connections, but autonomous cars ""Will be fully capable of operating without C-V2X.""[269] In addition, the earlier mentioned entertainment industry is also highly dependent on this network to be active in this market segment. This implies higher revenues for the telecommunication industry.\n\nHospitality industry and airlines [ edit ]\n\nDriver interactions with the vehicle will be less common within the near future, and in the more distant future, the responsibility will lie entirely with the vehicle. As indicated above, this will have implications for the entertainment- and interior design industry. For roadside restaurants, the implication will be that the need for customers to stop driving and enter the restaurant will vanish, and the autonomous vehicle will have a double function. Moreover, accompanied by the rise of disruptive platforms such as Airbnb that have shaken up the hotel industry, the fast increase of developments within the autonomous vehicle industry might cause another implication for their customer bases. In the more distant future, the implication for motels might be that a decrease in guests will occur, since autonomous vehicles could be redesigned as fully equipped bedrooms. The improvements regarding the interior of the vehicles might additionally have implications for the airline industry. In the case of relatively short-haul flights, waiting times at customs or the gate imply lost time and hassle for customers. With the improved convenience in future car travel, it is possible that customers might go for this option, causing a loss in customer bases for the airline industry.[270]\n\nIncidents [ edit ]\n\nTesla Autopilot [ edit ]\n\nIn mid\xe2\x80\x91October 2015, Tesla Motors rolled out version 7 of their software in the US that included Tesla Autopilot capability.[271] On 9 January 2016, Tesla rolled out version 7.1 as an over-the-air update, adding a new ""summon"" feature that allows cars to retrieve or self-park at parking locations without the driver in the car.[272] As of November 2020 , Tesla\'s automated driving features is currently classified as a Level 2 driver assistance system according to the Society of Automotive Engineers\' (SAE) five levels of vehicle automation.[55] At this level the car can be automated but requires the full attention of the driver, who must be prepared to take control at a moment\'s notice;[273][274][275][276] Autopilot will sometimes fail to detect lane markings and disengage itself while alerting the driver.[277]\n\nOn 20 January 2016, the first of five known fatal crashes of a Tesla with Autopilot occurred in China\'s Hubei province.[278] According to China\'s 163.com news channel, this marked ""China\'s first accidental death due to Tesla\'s automatic driving (system)"". Initially, Tesla pointed out that the vehicle was so badly damaged from the impact that their recorder was not able to conclusively prove that the car had been on Autopilot at the time; however, 163.com pointed out that other factors, such as the car\'s absolute failure to take any evasive actions prior to the high speed crash, and the driver\'s otherwise good driving record, seemed to indicate a strong likelihood that the car was on Autopilot at the time. A similar fatal crash occurred four months later in Florida.[279][280] In 2018, in a subsequent civil suit between the father of the driver killed and Tesla, Tesla did not deny that the car had been on Autopilot at the time of the accident, and sent evidence to the victim\'s father documenting that fact.[281]\n\nThe second known fatal accident involving a vehicle being driven by itself took place in Williston, Florida on 7 May 2016 while a Tesla Model S electric car was engaged in Autopilot mode. The occupant was killed in a crash with an 18-wheel tractor-trailer. On 28 June 2016 the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened a formal investigation into the accident working with the Florida Highway Patrol. According to NHTSA, preliminary reports indicate the crash occurred when the tractor-trailer made a left turn in front of the Tesla at an intersection on a non-controlled access highway, and the car failed to apply the brakes. The car continued to travel after passing under the truck\'s trailer.[282][283] NHTSA\'s preliminary evaluation was opened to examine the design and performance of any automated driving systems in use at the time of the crash, which involved a population of an estimated 25,000 Model S cars.[284] On 8 July 2016, NHTSA requested Tesla Motors provide the agency detailed information about the design, operation and testing of its Autopilot technology. The agency also requested details of all design changes and updates to Autopilot since its introduction, and Tesla\'s planned updates schedule for the next four months.[285]\n\nAccording to Tesla, ""neither autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor-trailer against a brightly lit sky, so the brake was not applied."" The car attempted to drive full speed under the trailer, ""with the bottom of the trailer impacting the windshield of the Model S"". Tesla also claimed that this was Tesla\'s first known autopilot death in over 130 million miles (210 million kilometers) driven by its customers with Autopilot engaged, however by this statement, Tesla was apparently refusing to acknowledge claims that the January 2016 fatality in Hubei China had also been the result of an autopilot system error. According to Tesla there is a fatality every 94 million miles (151 million kilometers) among all type of vehicles in the US[282][283][286] However, this number also includes fatalities of the crashes, for instance, of motorcycle drivers with pedestrians.[287][288]\n\nIn July 2016, the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) opened a formal investigation into the fatal accident while the Autopilot was engaged. The NTSB is an investigative body that has the power to make only policy recommendations. An agency spokesman said ""It\'s worth taking a look and seeing what we can learn from that event, so that as that automation is more widely introduced we can do it in the safest way possible.""[289] In January 2017, the NTSB released the report that concluded Tesla was not at fault; the investigation revealed that for Tesla cars, the crash rate dropped by 40 percent after Autopilot was installed.[290]\n\nWaymo [ edit ]\n\nWaymo originated as a self-driving car project within Google. In August 2012, Google announced that their vehicles had completed over 300,000 automated-driving miles (500,000 km) accident-free, typically involving about a dozen cars on the road at any given time, and that they were starting to test with single drivers instead of in pairs.[291] In late-May 2014, Google revealed a new prototype that had no steering wheel, gas pedal, or brake pedal, and was fully automated .[292] As of March 2016 , Google had test-driven their fleet in automated mode a total of 1,500,000 mi (2,400,000 km).[293] In December 2016, Google Corporation announced that its technology would be spun off to a new company called Waymo, with both Google and Waymo becoming subsidiaries of a new parent company called Alphabet.[294][295]\n\nAccording to Google\'s accident reports as of early 2016, their test cars had been involved in 14 collisions, of which other drivers were at fault 13 times, although in 2016 the car\'s software caused a crash.[296]\n\nIn June 2015, Brin confirmed that 12 vehicles had suffered collisions as of that date. Eight involved rear-end collisions at a stop sign or traffic light, two in which the vehicle was side-swiped by another driver, one in which another driver rolled through a stop sign, and one where a Google employee was controlling the car manually.[297] In July 2015, three Google employees suffered minor injuries when their vehicle was rear-ended by a car whose driver failed to brake at a traffic light. This was the first time that a collision resulted in injuries.[298] On 14 February 2016 a Google vehicle attempted to avoid sandbags blocking its path. During the maneuver it struck a bus. Google stated, ""In this case, we clearly bear some responsibility, because if our car hadn\'t moved, there wouldn\'t have been a collision.""[299][300] Google characterized the crash as a misunderstanding and a learning experience. No injuries were reported in the crash.[296]\n\nUber [ edit ]\n\nIn March 2017, an Uber test vehicle was involved in a crash in Tempe, Arizona when another car failed to yield, flipping the Uber vehicle. There were no injuries in the accident.[301]\n\nBy 22 December 2017, Uber had completed 2 million miles (3.2 million kilometers) in automated mode.[302]\n\nOn 18 March 2018, Elaine Herzberg became the first pedestrian to be killed by a self-driving car in the United States after being hit by an Uber vehicle, also in Tempe. Herzberg was crossing outside of a crosswalk, approximately 400 feet from an intersection.[303] This marks the first time an individual is known to have been killed by an autonomous vehicle.\n\nThe first death of an essentially uninvolved third party is likely to raise new questions and concerns about the safety of automated cars in general.[304] Some experts say a human driver could have avoided the fatal crash.[305] Arizona Governor Doug Ducey later suspended the company\'s ability to test and operate its automated cars on public roadways citing an ""unquestionable failure"" of the expectation that Uber make public safety its top priority.[306] Uber has pulled out of all self-driving-car testing in California as a result of the accident.[307] On 24 May 2018 the US National Transport Safety Board issued a preliminary report.[308]\n\nOn 16 September 2020, according to the BBC, the backup driver has been charged of negligent homicide, because she did not look to the road for several seconds while her television was streaming The Voice broadcast by Hulu. Uber does not face any criminal charge because in the USA there is no basis for criminal liability for the corporation. The driver is assumed to be responsible of the accident, because she was in the driver seat in capacity to avoid an accident (like in a Level 3). Trial is planned for February 2021.[309]\n\nNavya automated bus driving system [ edit ]\n\nOn 9 November 2017, a Navya automated self-driving bus with passengers was involved in a crash with a truck. The truck was found to be at fault of the crash, reversing into the stationary automated bus. The automated bus did not take evasive actions or apply defensive driving techniques such as flashing its headlights, or sounding the horn. As one passenger commented, ""The shuttle didn\'t have the ability to move back. The shuttle just stayed still.""[310]\n\nPublic opinion surveys [ edit ]\n\nIn a 2011 online survey of 2,006 US and UK consumers by Accenture, 49% said they would be comfortable using a ""driverless car"".[311]\n\nA 2012 survey of 17,400 vehicle owners by J.D. Power and Associates found 37% initially said they would be interested in purchasing a ""fully autonomous car"". However, that figure dropped to 20% if told the technology would cost US$3,000 more.[312]\n\nIn a 2012 survey of about 1,000 German drivers by automotive researcher Puls, 22% of the respondents had a positive attitude towards these cars, 10% were undecided, 44% were skeptical and 24% were hostile.[313]\n\nA 2013 survey of 1,500 consumers across 10 countries by Cisco Systems found 57% ""stated they would be likely to ride in a car controlled entirely by technology that does not require a human driver"", with Brazil, India and China the most willing to trust automated technology.[314]\n\nIn a 2014 US telephone survey by Insurance.com, over three-quarters of licensed drivers said they would at least consider buying a self-driving car, rising to 86% if car insurance were cheaper. 31.7% said they would not continue to drive once an automated car was available instead.[315]\n\nIn a February 2015 survey of top auto journalists, 46% predict that either Tesla or Daimler will be the first to the market with a fully autonomous vehicle, while (at 38%) Daimler is predicted to be the most functional, safe, and in-demand autonomous vehicle.[316]\n\nIn 2015 a questionnaire survey by Delft University of Technology explored the opinion of 5,000 people from 109 countries on automated driving. Results showed that respondents, on average, found manual driving the most enjoyable mode of driving. 22% of the respondents did not want to spend any money for a fully automated driving system. Respondents were found to be most concerned about software hacking/misuse, and were also concerned about legal issues and safety. Finally, respondents from more developed countries (in terms of lower accident statistics, higher education, and higher income) were less comfortable with their vehicle transmitting data.[317] The survey also gave results on potential consumer opinion on interest of purchasing an automated car, stating that 37% of surveyed current owners were either ""definitely"" or ""probably"" interested in purchasing an automated car.[317]\n\nIn 2016, a survey in Germany examined the opinion of 1,603 people, who were representative in terms of age, gender, and education for the German population, towards partially, highly, and fully automated cars. Results showed that men and women differ in their willingness to use them. Men felt less anxiety and more joy towards automated cars, whereas women showed the exact opposite. The gender difference towards anxiety was especially pronounced between young men and women but decreased with participants\' age.[318]\n\nIn 2016, a PwC survey, in the United States, showing the opinion of 1,584 people, highlights that ""66 percent of respondents said they think autonomous cars are probably smarter than the average human driver"". People are still worried about safety and mostly the fact of having the car hacked. Nevertheless, only 13% of the interviewees see no advantages in this new kind of cars.[319]\n\nIn 2017, Pew Research Center surveyed 4,135 US adults from 1\xe2\x80\x9315 May and found that many Americans anticipate significant impacts from various automation technologies in the course of their lifetimes\xe2\x80\x94from the widespread adoption of automated vehicles to the replacement of entire job categories with robot workers.[320]\n\nIn 2019, results from two opinion surveys of 54 and 187 US adults respectively were published. A new standardised questionnaire, the autonomous vehicle acceptance model (AVAM) was developed, including additional description to help respondents better understand the implications of different automation levels. Results showed that users were less accepting of high autonomy levels and displayed significantly lower intention to use highly autonomous vehicles. Additionally, partial autonomy (regardless of level) was perceived as requiring uniformly higher driver engagement (usage of hands, feet and eyes) than full autonomy.[321]\n\nRegulation [ edit ]\n\nThe Geneva Convention on Road Traffic subscribed to by over 101 countries worldwide, requires the driver to be 18 years old.\n\nThe 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, subscribed to by over 70 countries worldwide, establishes principles to govern traffic laws. One of the fundamental principles of the convention has been the concept that a driver is always fully in control and responsible for the behavior of a vehicle in traffic.[322] In 2016, a reform of the convention has open possibilities for automated features. The progress of technology that assists and takes over the functions of the driver is undermining this principle, implying that much of the groundwork must be rewritten.[citation needed]\n\nThis means that in those countries cars might be automated or autonomous or self-driving but not driver-less.\n\nLegislation in Japan [ edit ]\n\nIn 2019, Japan amended two laws, ""Road Traffic Act"" and ""Road Transport Vehicle Act"",[323] and they came into effect in April 2020. In the former act, Level 3 self driving cars became allowed on public roads.[324] In the latter act, process to designate types for safety certification on Level 3 self driving function of Autonomous Driving System (ADS) and the certification process for the asserted type were legally defined.[325] Through the amendment process, the achievements from the national project ""SIP-adus"" led by Cabinet Office since 2014 were fully considered and accepted.[326]\n\nIn 2020, the next stage national level roadmap plan was officially issued which had considered social deployment and acceptability of Level 4.[327][328]\n\nIn 2021, National Police Agency published its committee report of FY 2020 on summary of issues in research to realize Level 4 mobility services, including required legal amendment issues.[329][330]\n\nLegal status in the United States [ edit ]\n\nUS states that allow testing of autonomous vehicles on public roads as of June 2018\n\nIn the United States, a non-signatory country to the Vienna Convention, state vehicle codes generally do not envisage\xe2\x80\x94but do not necessarily prohibit\xe2\x80\x94highly automated vehicles as of 2012 .[331][332] To clarify the legal status of and otherwise regulate such vehicles, several states have enacted or are considering specific laws.[333] By 2016, seven states (Nevada, California, Florida, Michigan, Hawaii, Washington, and Tennessee), along with the District of Columbia, have enacted laws for automated vehicles. Incidents such as the first fatal accident by Tesla\'s Autopilot system have led to discussion about revising laws and standards for automated cars.\n\nFederal policies [ edit ]\n\nIn September 2016, the US National Economic Council and US Department of Transportation (USDOT) released the Federal Automated Vehicles Policy,[334] which are standards that describe how automated vehicles should react if their technology fails, how to protect passenger privacy, and how riders should be protected in the event of an accident. The new federal guidelines are meant to avoid a patchwork of state laws, while avoiding being so overbearing as to stifle innovation.[335] Since then, USDOT has released multiple updates:\n\nAutomated Driving Systems: A Vision for Safety 2.0 (12 September 2017) [336]\n\n(12 September 2017) Preparing for the Future of Transportation: Automated Vehicles 3.0 (4 October 2018) [337]\n\n(4 October 2018) Ensuring American Leadership in Automated Vehicle Technologies: Automated Vehicles 4.0 (8 January 2020)[338]\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration released for public comment the Occupant Protection for Automated Driving System on 30 March 2020,[339] followed by the Framework for Automated Driving System Safety on 3 December 2020.[340] Occupant Protection is intended to modernize the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards considering the removal of manual controls with automated driving systems,[341] while the Framework document is intended to provide an objective way to define and assess automated driving system competence to ensure motor vehicle safety while also remaining flexible to accommodate the development of features to improve safety.[342]\n\nState policies [ edit ]\n\nNevada\n\nIn June 2011, the Nevada Legislature passed a law to authorize the use of automated cars. Nevada thus became the first jurisdiction in the world where automated vehicles might be legally operated on public roads. According to the law, the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles is responsible for setting safety and performance standards and the agency is responsible for designating areas where automated cars may be tested.[343][344][345] This legislation was supported by Google in an effort to legally conduct further testing of its Google driverles'";"Autonomous Cars";"102.txt-Autonomous Cars"
"104.txt";"b'The dream of the self-driving car \xe2\x80\x94 you get in, program your destination, ease the seat back, and let the car take you where you need to go. Read a book. Maybe take a nap or play a game on the in-car entertainment screen. Regardless, you will not need to watch the road. The car will get you there and back safely.\n\nAre we there yet? If not, when will we be?\n\nAutomation and autonomous driving are complex subjects. What engineers can safely deliver doesn\xe2\x80\x99t always match what marketers want to sell.\n\nThis guide will walk you through what you need to know about automotive autopilot, self-driving technology, and driver aids today and tomorrow.\n\nWhat is a Self-Driving Car?\n\nWhen discussing automotive assistance systems\xe2\x80\x99 terminology, no one agrees on what to call anything in this field. From engineering jargon to marketing speak, the lingo continues to evolve.\n\nRoughly speaking, you can sort the technologies people might refer to as self-driving into two categories \xe2\x80\x94 driver support and automation systems. Read on to see how they differ.\n\nDriver Support\n\nDriver support technology reduces the workload on the driver. Today, most automakers sell various driver support systems, either as standard equipment or as options on their cars. These include intelligent or adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assists, and hands-free capability.\n\nAutonomous Systems\n\nAutonomous systems do the driving for you. No automaker today sells a true autonomous system, but some are pushing toward that technology. One such project underway is Waymo, a sister company to Google, that is testing autonomous rideshare vehicles in Phoenix using converted Chrysler Pacifica minivans.\n\nRELATED STORIES: Report: Apple Self-Driving Car Coming by 2024\n\nSix Levels of Self-Driving Technology\n\nSAE International, a global association of engineers and related technical experts in the aerospace, automotive, and commercial-vehicle industries, has laid out a useful framework for thinking about self-driving systems. They sort the technologies into six levels, labeled zero through five (okay, even automotive engineers don\xe2\x80\x99t always do the logical thing).\n\nHowever, not every level is classified as autonomous driving. According to SAE, levels zero through two are considered driver support features, while levels three through five are classified as having autonomous capability.\n\nLevel 0\n\nAt Level 0, the car reacts only to the driver\xe2\x80\x99s input. Even if it uses sensors to warn you of surrounding traffic, like a blind-spot alert system or a lane-departure warning, it still has no self-driving capability to correct or counter the perceived threat.\n\nLevel 1\n\nAt Level 1, your car can intervene slightly in your driving in an attempt to keep you safe. A lane-keeping system that helps steer to center you in a lane is a Level 1 technology.\n\nRELATED STORIES: What is Adaptive Cruise Control?\n\nLevel 2\n\nAt Level 2, features communicate with one another, and more than one can be active simultaneously. An example of this autonomous technology is an adaptive cruise control system that adjusts your speed to keep you a certain distance from the car ahead while centering the car in its lane.\n\nCurrently, Level 2 systems are the most sophisticated technology sold on cars in America. Some automakers describe these systems in ways that make them seem more advanced than Level 2 standards because they allow drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel briefly. However, all these systems require drivers to keep their eyes focused ahead. Drivers need to be ready at all times to take over control of the car at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice.\n\nLevel 3\n\nAt Level 3, the car can drive itself under limited conditions, but the driver must remain aware and prepared to take over. Automakers have tested Level 3 systems that will allow the driver to take their hands off the wheel in a traffic jam, for instance, but prompt the driver to take over when the congestion eases.\n\nAccording to Honda and a few other reputable sites, the Honda 100 Legend Flagship car is the first Level 3 autonomous car. Right now, it\xe2\x80\x99s only available in Japan for leasing. It was released on March 5, 2021.\n\nThere are no Level 3 systems currently sold to consumers in the U.S.\n\nLevel 4\n\nAt Level 4, the car can drive itself in a fixed loop on known roads. The rider is not required to take over driving at any time. These vehicles may or may not have a steering wheel or pedals. In some places, Level 4 driverless rideshare vehicles (like Waymo\xe2\x80\x99s) are in limited testing. But they are not yet approved for general use in any state.\n\nLevel 5\n\nAt Level 5, the car can drive itself under any conditions and on any road. These vehicles do not have steering wheels or pedals. At this point, Level 5 systems are theoretical.\n\nCan You Trust It?\n\nAll self-driving systems currently for sale in the United States are SAE Level 2 or lower. It is not safe to remove your attention from driving while behind the wheel of any car currently sold with this technology. However, it is safe to briefly remove your hands from the wheel with some Level 2 systems under certain conditions. But you should remain prepared to take over the driving at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice.\n\nTesla advertises its automation systems more aggressively than any other U.S. automaker. Still, its advertising materials flatly state, \xe2\x80\x9cAutopilot and Full Self-Driving Capability are intended for use with a fully attentive driver, who has their hands on the wheel and is prepared to take over at any moment. While these features are designed to become more capable over time, the currently enabled features do not make the vehicle autonomous.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDo You Still Need to Pay Attention to the Road?\n\nYes. Always. Even when using driving assist technology in Levels 0 to 3, it\xe2\x80\x99s required that you always keep your eyes on the road.\n\nHowever, when using low-speed applications, including self-parking features, keeping your eyes on the road or staying inside the vehicle may not be needed. For example, some luxury brands offer a self-parking remote that handles this maneuver for things like parallel parking.\n\nWhich Cars Have Self-Driving Capability?\n\nVirtually every automaker selling cars in the U.S. today offers driver-assistance systems that can reduce the workload on the driver. These include adaptive cruise control that can adjust speed to maintain distance from the car ahead or automatic emergency braking that can slow or stop the car to avoid hitting a vehicle or pedestrian or reduce the severity of a crash.\n\nNone of these systems are so reliable that the driver can take their attention from the task of driving, though.\n\nMany manufacturers currently market systems up to and including Level 2 automation. This approach combines adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assist into a system that requires that the driver keep their hands on the wheel but relieves some of the driver\xe2\x80\x99s workload.\n\nA prime example is cruise control with stop-and-go capability that allows the driver to negotiate heavy traffic without using the pedals.\n\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s a breakdown of what to expect from several of them.\n\nNissan ProPILOT\n\nNissan markets this as ProPILOT, \xe2\x80\x9ca hands-on driver-assist system that combines Nissan\xe2\x80\x99s Intelligent Cruise Control and Steering Assist technologies and includes a stop and hold function that can bring the vehicle to a full stop, hold in place, and can bring you back up to speed when traffic starts moving again.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNewer versions use the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s navigation system information to slow for curves ahead and prompt the driver to adjust for posted speed limits. While it will keep the car centered in its lane, it will not steer the car through curves like Kia\xe2\x80\x99s, Ford\xe2\x80\x99s, GM\xe2\x80\x99s, or Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s systems.\n\nSubaru EyeSight\n\nSubaru\xe2\x80\x99s EyeSight system does much the same. It also has a pre-collision braking system that alerts the driver to an impending crash and applies full braking power to try to prevent it.\n\nVolvo Pilot Assist\n\nVolvo\xe2\x80\x99s Pilot Assist allows the driver to set a preferred speed and preferred distance from the vehicle ahead. It can then change speed to maintain that distance and keep the car centered in its lane. But Pilot Assist will warn the driver audibly and shut itself off if the road starts to curve or if it detects that the driver has removed their hands from the wheel.\n\nMercedes-Benz Distronic Plus with Steering Assist\n\nMercedes-Benz\xe2\x80\x99s Distronic Plus with Steering Assist also combines adaptive cruise control with a lane-centering system. In keeping with Mercedes\xe2\x80\x99 autobahn image, it functions at up to 120 mph and warns drivers if they are about to be passed.\n\nAnother feature, called Parktronic, allows drivers to follow the car\xe2\x80\x99s commands under 20 mph as it self-parks the vehicle. The driver keeps control of the car with the gas and brake pedals. The driver just needs to put the car in drive or reverse as it drives and steers itself into a parking space.\n\nTesla Autopilot and Full Self-Driving\n\nTesla markets its evolving suite of self-driving technologies more aggressively than any other automaker. This has led to some confusion as to what level of automation Tesla cars are currently capable of. The electric car company sells the systems under two names: Autopilot, and Full Self-Driving.\n\nEvery Tesla vehicle available in 2021 ships with the company\xe2\x80\x99s Autopilot system enabled. Autopilot is a traffic-aware cruise control system that accelerates and slows the car to match the speed of the cars around it, combined with a lane-keeping assist system that centers the car in a clearly marked lane. That\xe2\x80\x99s all it is. The marketing name \xe2\x80\x9cAutopilot\xe2\x80\x9d may make it sound considerably more advanced. But it is similar to adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assist systems offered by most automakers, like Nissan\xe2\x80\x99s ProPILOT or Subaru\xe2\x80\x99s EyeSight.\n\nOlder Teslas use torque sensors in the steering wheel to monitor the driver\xe2\x80\x99s attention level and promptly alert them if their attention seems to be waning. Newer models use a more accurate camera for the same purpose.\n\nFull Self-Driving\n\nTesla\xe2\x80\x99s Full Self-Driving is considerably more sophisticated. Despite its name, it does not possess SAE Level 5 self-driving capability. Full Self-Driving can park the car in a parking space, back it out of a parking space, and change lanes on its own at highway speeds. A more advanced system in beta testing can slow the car for stop signs and traffic lights and navigate highway on-ramps and off-ramps. Tesla regularly sends updates to this system remotely to cars currently involved in the beta test.\n\nCrucially, Full Self-Driving does not allow the driver to take their attention from the road. They may temporarily take their hands from the wheel but should be prepared to take over driving at any moment. Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s own marketing materials caution, \xe2\x80\x9cThe currently enabled Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFull Self-Driving is a costly option, even by luxury car standards. As of this writing, the Tesla self-driving price for the feature adds $10,000 to the total cost. Tesla promises to update it regularly in hopes of eventually releasing an SAE Level 5 autonomous driving system to everyone who has purchased Full Self-Driving.\n\nHowever, in a recent letter to California state regulators, Tesla said that Full Self-Driving would remain at Level 2. The company said it did \xe2\x80\x9cnot expect significant enhancements\xe2\x80\x9d that would \xe2\x80\x9cshift the responsibility for the entire dynamic driving task to the system.\xe2\x80\x9d Instead, the letter said, Full Self-Driving \xe2\x80\x9cwill continue to be an SAE Level 2, advanced driver assistance feature.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nConsumers should be aware that the company has told shoppers it will someday have Level 5 capability and has told government regulators that it would not.\n\nCheck out our YouTube videos on the Tesla Model Y and Tesla Model S\n\nGeneral Motors Super Cruise\n\nGeneral Motors offers its own advanced driver assistance system, an SAE Level 2 system called Super Cruise. Like Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s Autopilot, Super Cruise includes an adaptive cruise control that will speed up and slow down the vehicle to maintain a driver-selected distance from the vehicle ahead. It also has a lane-keeping system that tries to center the car in its lane even through curves in the road, and automatic emergency braking that brakes the car in an attempt to avert a collision.\n\nSuper Cruise requires the driver to stay alert and keep their hands near the wheel. It includes a driver monitoring system that watches the driver\xe2\x80\x99s eyes and warns them if their attention seems to be drifting from the road. GM says, \xe2\x80\x9cSuper Cruise allows the driver to drive hands-free when compatible road driving conditions allow the feature to be available. But the driver still needs to pay close attention to the road. Even while using the Super Cruise driver assistance technology, drivers should always pay attention while driving and not use a hand-held device.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSuper Cruise is currently available on most Cadillac vehicles and the Chevy Bolt and Bolt EUV electric vehicles. GM plans to extend it to parts of the Buick and GMC lineup in 2022. Super Cruise is free for the first three years but requires a subscription after that.\n\nOf note, Super Cruise works only on roads mapped by GM. The company mapped at least 200,000 miles of roads in the U.S. and Canada using lidar mapping technology.\n\nFord Blue Cruise\n\nFord and its Lincoln luxury division recently introduced their own Level 2 automation system, called Blue Cruise. Buyers can order Blue Cruise on many new Ford and Lincoln vehicles today. But the system isn\xe2\x80\x99t active yet. Ford expects to activate it late in 2021 through an over-the-air software update that will not require a visit to the dealership.\n\nLike Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s Autopilot and GM\xe2\x80\x99s Super Cruise systems, Blue Cruise pairs an adaptive cruise control with lane-keeping assistance. It allows drivers to temporarily remove their hands from the wheel while keeping their eyes on the road.\n\nBlue Cruise automatically steers the vehicle using more than 100,000 miles of pre-mapped roads stored in the system. In Blue Cruise-equipped cars, the driver\xe2\x80\x99s instrument cluster switches to a blue background when driving on a road where the system can be activated.\n\nA subscription to Blue Cruise costs $600 for three years. However, to use it, you must buy an option package that has all the necessary equipment. The cost range is $995 to $2,600, depending on the model.\n\nTraffic Jam Assists\n\nLuxury automakers have begun developing semi-autonomous driving systems specifically for use in heavy traffic. They allow the driver to relax their attention and let the car accelerate and brake to keep its place in traffic, but systems work only at lower speeds.\n\nBMW\xe2\x80\x99s Active Driving Assistant Pro, for instance, shuts off when traffic exceeds 40 mph. It will not steer the vehicle through curves.\n\nAudi is developing its own Traffic Jam Pilot that, it says, should allow drivers to remove their hands from the wheel below 37 mph. But that system has not received regulatory approval.\n\nThe Future of Self-Driving Cars\n\nEngineers from more than a dozen companies are testing self-driving systems in hopes of producing an SAE Level 5 self-driving car. It seems safe to predict that the technology is coming.\n\nBut the engineering challenge of getting there is immense. A car that can drive itself on well-maintained roads may make a critical mistake on poorly maintained roads. What if a car that can react safely to normal traffic may not react safely to unusual situations? A car that can do everything engineers ask of it may fail when presented with a problem they never considered (in one recent incident, a self-driving car in testing was baffled by a truck bed full of traffic signs being delivered to a construction site. The car had no idea what to do).\n\nBeyond the engineering challenge, 50 sets of state laws (plus the District of Columbia) must adapt to decide safety and liability issues before self-driving cars can become common.\n\nThe market will also have its say. Volkswagen recently unveiled a concept car that would charge by the mile for self-driving capability. Executives reasoned that as long as getting your car to drive you somewhere costs less than a train ticket to that same place, they could charge for using the self-driving feature. So, while some automakers hope to charge buyers upfront for automation, others may make it available for short-term rental only.\n\nLastly, there\xe2\x80\x99s the matter of marketing. It\xe2\x80\x99s already growing difficult to sort what manufacturers claim their cars can do from what they can actually do. That will only grow cloudier as the technology advances.\n\nSo, while you may be able to own a self-driving car in your lifetime, it may be further away than advancing technology would indicate.\n\nMore: Best Cars and Top 10 Lists\n\nRelated Self-Driving Stories:'";"Autonomous Cars";"104.txt-Autonomous Cars"

"107.txt";"b'Who wouldn\'t want to just press a button, have the steering wheel and pedals stowed, and let your self-driving car whisk you in cocooned comfort to your parent\'s house five hours away while you sleep, work, or play with your kids? That\'s a dream scenario self-driving cars promise. Proponents say there would be no more crashes, no more drunk driving, no more traffic. It\'s tantalizing to think that cars will one day be able to drive us. It can also be terrifying to others who fear letting go of the wheel of control.\n\nSelf-driving cars are already here, in a sense. There are limited trials of vehicles running with no drivers along predetermined, hyper-limited routes in the U.S. and other countries, operated by their makers and technology companies. But the day when millions of self-driving cars ply the world\'s roads is still a long way out. But how far? We take a look at some of the most common questions surrounding self-driving cars and when you might no longer be behind the wheel.\n\nHow Much Does a Self-Driving Car Cost?\n\nAccording to former Waymo CEO John Krafcik, in an interview with German publication Manager Magazin, a Jaguar I-Pace equipped with Waymo\'s sensors and computers costs no more than a moderately equipped Mercedes-Benz S-Class. So likely in the $130,000-$150,000 ballpark. Of course, these costs will come down as the technologies used to power self-driving cars (cameras, radar systems, sensors, advanced automotive computers) drop as the costs to make them become more affordable at scale and they advance enough to be relied upon in all circumstances and conditions. Using Waymo\'s lidar as an example, its engineering team was able to build a version that costs 90 percent less than what used to be $75,000 a unit.\n\nSee all 3 photos See all 3 photos\n\nWhat Are These Automated Driving Levels I Keep Hearing About?\n\nThe Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) has classified six levels of automation. Level 0, Level 1, and Level 2 systems require a human to be actively driving and monitoring the vehicle and the driving environment at all times; think lane-keep assist or active cruise-control systems as seen on current vehicles. But Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 are where automated systems start to take control and when ""self-driving"" enters the picture. Level 3 is in essence a bridge level where the system can drive the car for a period of time, but the driver must still be ready to re-engage with the system at a moment\'s notice. Level 4 and 5 are where the car essentially drives you, with Level 4 still having a few limited scenarios where the driver may need to take over. Level 5 means never having any control of the vehicle whatsoever.\n\nCan I Buy a Self-Driving Car Now?\n\nNo. No vehicles available for sale in the U.S. today are self-driving. Cars equipped with Tesla Autopilot, Ford BlueCruise, and GM SuperCruise are NOT self-driving. They may appear to be self-driving, given that you can drive without your hands on the steering wheel for a predetermined length of time, but they are not reliable or capable enough to be true self-driving. Those systems are classified as Level 2 capable, where the driver can briefly cede driving responsibilities but must be alert and always ready to take over. In effect, the driver is still in charge of the operation of the vehicle, no matter what the system is capable of performing.\n\nSee all 3 photos See all 3 photos\n\nWhen Can I Buy a Self-Driving Car in the Future?\n\nAt this point, self-driving cars are more of a future technology like what you might see in Black Mirror (a near future science fiction TV drama). The tech seems highly plausible, but we are not there yet in reality. We are at a point where we may see Level 3 self-driving cars in the next five years, but they would only work in very limited conditions. Chances are, you may be able to ride in a self-driving taxi without a driver before seeing a self-driving car for sale on a dealer lot. There are still many problems to tackle before Level 4 or 5 autonomous cars can become a real thing. In the meantime, companies will sell some intermediate products to fund their self-driving development. For example, Tesla\'s Full Self-Driving (FSD) system. In theory, a Tesla with FSD has the hardware to ""self-drive,"" but development is not there yet. What Tesla is selling now is a Level 2 driving assist system for real and self-driving as a promise.\n\nWhat Are the Advantages of Self-Driving Cars?\n\nSafety is a major benefit of self-driving cars. The prevailing wisdom is that self-driving systems will drastically reduce or even remove human error on the road, which will reduce crashes to virtually zero. Humans can get tired and distracted, something machines and algorithms will never be. Computers are also able to strictly follow rules and cooperate with one another, so along with a reduced number of crashes, self-driving cars can help smooth out traffic flow and reduce traffic jams. They can also solve the headache of looking for a parking spot by self-parking by themselves. For people who cannot drive (age, disability, or any other reason), automated vehicles can provide them with new personal mobility options.\n\nWhat are Disadvantages of Self-Driving Cars?\n\nIn today\'s stage, the self-drive working condition is very limited. Honda\'s Traffic Jam Pilot can only self-drive under 30 mph (Audi\'s under 37 mph), and Level 4 Waymo vehicles can only operate within a confined zone when weather permits. High cost will also remain a disadvantage until the technology becomes mainstream. Then there\'s the question of how infallible all of the computing power and technology necessary to power self-driving cars will be. Personal computers freeze all the time. What happens when a car\'s computer brain freezes?\n\nCan You Sleep in a Self-Driving Car?\n\nIn a true Level 4 or 5 automated vehicle, yes, you could sleep, but at that point, you\'re basically a passenger, much like riding in a taxi. But in a Level 3 car you\'ll need to remain awake because whenever self-driving conditions are not met, the system needs a human driver to take control. And NO, DO NOT sleep in a Tesla on Autopilot. It is not a self-driving car, even if you bought the Full Self-Driving option.\n\nWhat Technologies Are Essential for Self-Driving Cars?\n\nDriving is a complicated task, so there are many technologies involved. To name a few: ultra-high-resolution cameras with high-dynamic-range sensors to see in various light conditions, ultrasonic sensors to detect objects around the car, light-emitting radar (lidar) to detect faraway objects, ultra-fast computer chips to process the large influx of data pouring in by the millisecond (not to mention storage of said data), and sophisticated software to do the driving. You also need high-speed internet connections to move data to and from the car, to and from other cars, and to and from any infrastructure. One major tech development that will help speed up self-driving car development is machine learning. It contributes to a boost in developing greater image recognition and driving algorithms.\n\nWhat Is Machine Learning for Cars?'";"Autonomous Cars";"107.txt-Autonomous Cars"

"116.txt";"b""When it comes to self-driving cars, the future was supposed to be now.\n\nIn 2020, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be a \xe2\x80\x9cpermanent backseat driver,\xe2\x80\x9d the Guardian predicted in 2015. \xe2\x80\x9c10 million self-driving cars will be on the road by 2020,\xe2\x80\x9d blared a Business Insider headline from 2016. Those declarations were accompanied by announcements from General Motors, Google\xe2\x80\x99s Waymo, Toyota, and Honda that they\xe2\x80\x99d be making self-driving cars by 2020. Elon Musk forecast that Tesla would do it by 2018 \xe2\x80\x94 and then, when that failed, by 2020.\n\nBut the year is here \xe2\x80\x94 and the self-driving cars aren\xe2\x80\x99t.\n\nDespite extraordinary efforts from many of the leading names in tech and in automaking, fully autonomous cars are still out of reach except in special trial programs. You can buy a car that will automatically brake for you when it anticipates a collision, or one that helps keep you in your lane, or even a Tesla Model S (which \xe2\x80\x94 disclosure \xe2\x80\x94 my partner and I own) whose Autopilot mostly handles highway driving.\n\nBut almost every one of the above predictions has been rolled back as the engineering teams at those companies struggle to make self-driving cars work properly.\n\nWhat happened? Here are nine questions you might have had about this long-promised technology, and why the future we were promised still hasn\xe2\x80\x99t arrived.\n\n1) How exactly do self-driving cars work?\n\nEngineers have been attempting prototypes of self-driving cars for decades. The idea behind it is really simple: Outfit a car with cameras that can track all the objects around it and have the car react if it\xe2\x80\x99s about to steer into one. Teach in-car computers the rules of the road and set them loose to navigate to their own destination.\n\nThis simple description elides a whole lot of complexity. Driving is one of the more complicated activities humans routinely do. Following a list of rules of the road isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough to drive as well as a human does, because we do things like make eye contact with others to confirm who has the right of way, react to weather conditions, and otherwise make judgment calls that are difficult to encode in hard-and-fast rules.\n\nAnd even the simple parts of driving \xe2\x80\x94 like tracking the objects around a car on the road \xe2\x80\x94 are actually much trickier than they sound. Take Google\xe2\x80\x99s sister company Waymo, the industry leader in self-driving cars. Waymo\xe2\x80\x99s cars, which are fairly typical of other self-driving cars, use high-resolution cameras and lidar (light detection and ranging), a way of estimating distances to objects by bouncing light and sound off things.\n\nThe car\xe2\x80\x99s computers combine all of this to build a picture of where other cars, cyclists, pedestrians, and obstacles are and where they\xe2\x80\x99re moving. For this part, lots of training data is needed \xe2\x80\x94 that is, the car has to draw on millions of miles of driving data that Waymo has collected to form expectations about how other objects might move. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to get enough training data on the road, so the cars also train based on simulation data \xe2\x80\x94 but engineers have to be sure that their AI systems will generalize correctly from the simulation data to the real world.\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s far from a complete description of the systems at work when a self-driving car is on the road. But it illustrates an important principle to keep in mind when wondering where our self-driving cars are: Even the \xe2\x80\x9ceasy\xe2\x80\x9d things turn out to hide surprising complexity.\n\n2) Why is it taking longer than expected to get self-driving cars on the road?\n\nSelf-driving cars rely on artificial intelligence to work. And the 2010s were a great decade for AI. We saw big advances in translation, speech generation, computer vision and object recognition, and game-playing. AI used to have a hard time identifying dogs in pictures; now that\xe2\x80\x99s a trivial task.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s this progress in AI that drove the optimistic predictions for self-driving cars in the mid-2010s. Researchers anticipated that we could build on the amazing gains they\xe2\x80\x99d seen (and are still seeing) in other arenas.\n\nBut when it came to self-driving cars, the limitations of those gains became very apparent. Even with extraordinary amounts of time, money, and effort invested, no team could figure out how to have AI solve a real-world problem: navigating our roads with the high degree of reliability needed.\n\nMuch of the problem is the need for lots of training data. The ideal way to train a self-driving car would be to show it billions of hours of footage of real driving, and use that to teach the computer good driving behavior. Modern machine learning systems do really well when they have abundant data, and very poorly when they have only a little bit of it. But collecting data for self-driving cars is expensive. And since some events are rare \xe2\x80\x94 witnessing a car accident ahead, say, or encountering debris on the road \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s possible for the car to be out of its depth because it has encountered a situation so infrequently in its training data.\n\nCarmakers have tried to get around this in lots of ways. They\xe2\x80\x99ve driven more miles. They\xe2\x80\x99ve trained the cars in simulations. They sometimes engineer specific situations so that they can get more training data about those situations for the cars.\n\nAnd they are getting closer. Waymo cars do roam the streets of Arizona with no one behind the wheel (a small pool of specially screened people can call them up like they would an Uber). If all goes well, they may expand to more cities later this year (more on this below). But it\xe2\x80\x99s a hard problem, and progress has been slow.\n\n3) What does a world with self-driving cars look like?\n\nCompanies continue to invest despite the setbacks because self-driving cars, when they happen, will change a lot for the world \xe2\x80\x94 and make their creators lots of money.\n\nMany consumers will want to upgrade. Imagine being able to read or doze off during your morning drive to work or on long car trips. It also seems likely that taxi and ride-hailing companies will offer self-driving cars, rather than paying drivers (in fact, companies like Uber are betting on it). Self-driving cars should also make a huge difference for Americans with disabilities, many of whom can\xe2\x80\x99t get a driver\xe2\x80\x99s license and have trouble getting to work, the store, and doctor\xe2\x80\x99s appointments.\n\nExperts disagree on whether self-driving cars will change anything fundamental about car ownership in America. Some argue that people won\xe2\x80\x99t need to own a car if they can order one on their phone and get a timely robot ride anywhere.\n\nOthers have pointed out that people generally still own a car even in areas with good ride-share coverage and that self-driving cars might not be any different. Polls suggest that most Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be driven to work by a self-driving car \xe2\x80\x94 but that might change fast once such cars actually exist. Gallup polling on this question found a small share (9 percent) of Americans who\xe2\x80\x99d get such a car right away, with a larger contingent (38 percent) saying they\xe2\x80\x99d wait a while, and half holding steadfast that they\xe2\x80\x99d never use one.\n\nOver time, our infrastructure will likely change to make it easier for self-driving cars to navigate, and in fact, some researchers have argued that we won\xe2\x80\x99t have widespread self-driving cars until we\xe2\x80\x99ve made major changes to our streets to make it easier to communicate information to those cars. That would be expensive and require nationwide coordination, so it seems likely that it would follow the widespread introduction of self-driving cars rather than precede it.\n\n4) What are the leading self-driving car programs, and what are they doing?\n\nAlmost every major car manufacturer has at least tested the waters with self-driving car research. But some are much more serious about it than others.\n\nThere are two core statistics useful for evaluating how advanced a self-driving car program is. One is how many miles it has driven. That\xe2\x80\x99s a proxy for how much training data the company has, and how much investment it has poured into getting its cars on the road.\n\nThe other is disengagements \xe2\x80\x94 moments when a human driver has to take over because the computer couldn\xe2\x80\x99t handle a situation \xe2\x80\x94 per mile driven. Most companies don\xe2\x80\x99t share these statistics, but the state of California requires that they be reported, and so California\xe2\x80\x99s statistics are the best peek into how various companies are doing.\n\nOn both fronts, Google\xe2\x80\x99s sister company Waymo is the clear leader. Waymo just announced 20 million miles driven overall, most of those not in California. In 2018, Waymo drove 1.2 million miles in California, with 0.09 disengagements every 1,000 miles. Coming in second is General Motors\xe2\x80\x99 Cruise, with about half a million miles and 0.19 disengagements per 1,000 miles. (Cruise argues that since it tests its cars on San Francisco\xe2\x80\x99s difficult streets, these numbers are even more impressive than they look.)\n\nThose two companies are well ahead of everyone else in both miles driven and disengagements in the state of California. While that\xe2\x80\x99s only a limited snapshot of their efforts, most experts consider them the leading programs in general.\n\n5) Didn\xe2\x80\x99t a self-driving car kill a woman? How did that happen? And what are the safety issues involved with self-driving cars?\n\nMarch 18, 2018, was the first time a self-driving car ran down a pedestrian. An Uber car with a safety driver behind the wheel hit and killed Elaine Herzberg, a 49-year-old woman walking her bicycle across the street in Tempe, Arizona.\n\nThe incident was a reminder that self-driving car technology still had a long way to go. Some people were quick to point out that humans frequently kill other humans while driving, and that even if self-driving cars are much safer than humans, there will be some fatal incidents with self-driving cars. That\xe2\x80\x99s true as far as it goes. But it misses a key point. Human driving produces one fatal accident in every 100 million miles driven. Waymo, the leader in miles driven, just reached 20 million miles driven. It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had a fatal accident yet, but given the number of miles its cars have driven, it\xe2\x80\x99s simply far too soon to prove that they\xe2\x80\x99re as safe as or safer than a human driver.\n\nUber hasn\xe2\x80\x99t driven nearly as many miles and has had a fatal incident. The company doesn\xe2\x80\x99t release specific figures, but its filings for its IPO last year said that it had driven \xe2\x80\x9cmillions\xe2\x80\x9d of miles. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to tell without specific numbers, but it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to wonder if Uber\xe2\x80\x99s driving record is much worse than a human\xe2\x80\x99s.\n\nFurthermore, a review of Herzberg\xe2\x80\x99s death suggests that a lot of preventable mistakes were made. The accident report by the National Transportation Safety Board, released in December 2019, found that the near-range cameras and the ultrasonic sensors \xe2\x80\x9cwere not in use at the time of the crash.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAdditionally, the system was having such a problem with false alarms \xe2\x80\x94 detecting dangerous situations when none existed \xe2\x80\x94 that it had been programmed with \xe2\x80\x9ca one-second period during which the ADS [automated driving system] suppresses planned braking while the (1) system verifies the nature of the detected hazard and calculates an alternative path, or (2) vehicle operator takes control of the vehicle,\xe2\x80\x9d according to the NTSB report. So even when the car detected the hazard, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t brake \xe2\x80\x94 which could have made the collision avoidable or much less deadly \xe2\x80\x94 but instead continued with exactly what it was doing for a full second.\n\nThe system was designed to assume that pedestrians would never cross except at a crosswalk, so when one did cross without using one, it failed to identify her. Even worse, when the system was unclear on whether an object was a bicycle (as it was with Herzberg), it was unable to retain any information about how the object was moving. The system sensed her presence six full seconds before the impact \xe2\x80\x94 and yet did nothing (except possibly braking in the last two-tenths of a second) before colliding with her at deadly speed.\n\nThose are avoidable failures.\n\nUber pulled its cars off the road in response, returning to self-driving car trials a year later with a drastically changed program. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve implemented key safety improvements from both safety reviews, shared our learnings with the larger self-driving industry, and accepted the NTSB\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation to implement a Safety Management System, which is underway today,\xe2\x80\x9d Nat Beuse, Uber\xe2\x80\x99s self-driving cars head of safety, told Vox in a statement in response to a request for comment. \xe2\x80\x9cAs we look ahead to the future, we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to keep safety at the center of every decision we make.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNonetheless, deadly accidents with self-driving cars will keep happening \xe2\x80\x94 and it\xe2\x80\x99s not just Uber. A report from the National Transportation Safety Board implicated Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s Autopilot system in another lethal 2018 accident; while the driver had his hands off the wheel, the car steered into a concrete divider and crashed, killing him. A full investigation hasn\xe2\x80\x99t yet been conducted on three more recent deadly Tesla crashes. The problem, according to NTSB chairman Robert Sumwalt, is that drivers assume Autopilot lets them take their attention off the road, when they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. That won\xe2\x80\x99t be a problem with fully autonomous vehicles, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a potentially major one now.\n\nAs I\xe2\x80\x99ve written before, getting good self-driving cars on the road can save hundreds of thousands of lives. But it takes a lot of engineering work to get the cars good enough to be lifesaving.\n\n6) Are self-driving cars going to be good for the environment?\n\nSome advocates have argued that self-driving cars will be good for the environment. They claim they might reduce car trips by making car ownership unnecessary and transitioning society to a model where most people don\xe2\x80\x99t own a car and just call for one when they need one.\n\nIn addition, others have argued that human drivers drive in a wasteful way \xe2\x80\x94 braking hard, accelerating hard, idling the engine, all of which use up fuel \xe2\x80\x94 which a computer could avoid.\n\nBut as self-driving cars have inched closer to reality, most of these claimed benefits have started to look less likely.\n\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s not much evidence that computers are dramatically more fuel-efficient drivers than humans. There\xe2\x80\x99s one small study suggesting adaptive cruise control improves efficiency a little (5 to 7 percent), but there\xe2\x80\x99s little else beyond that. Furthermore, researchers have examined the effects of more fuel-efficient cars on miles traveled and found that, under many circumstances, people drive more when cars get more fuel-efficient \xe2\x80\x94 so self-driving cars having higher fuel efficiency might not mean that they produce lower emissions.\n\nOne study attempting to estimate the effects of self-driving cars on car use behavior simulated a family having a self-driving car by paying for them to have a chauffeur for a week, and telling them to treat the chauffeur service the way they\xe2\x80\x99d treat having a car that could drive itself.\n\nThe result? They went on a lot more car trips.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s still possible that some big transition to a lower-driving world will happen. A study of one week of driving habits isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough to settle the question for sure. The researchers who conducted that study are preparing future studies, and it\xe2\x80\x99s possible those comparisons will turn up more encouraging results.\n\n7) So if they\xe2\x80\x99re not necessarily safer and they\xe2\x80\x99re not necessarily greener, why are we even doing this?\n\nThe above few sections might inspire some pessimism, but there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of reason to be excited about self-driving cars. They will likely make life easier for older people and those with disabilities who cannot safely drive. They might provide better, safer, and cheaper options for people currently forced to own a car to get anywhere. Additional research and development will make them safer \xe2\x80\x94 and once the kinks are worked out, there is a likelihood that self-driving cars will be safer than human-driven ones.\n\nIn a sense, we\xe2\x80\x99re in an awkward transition moment where we want self-driving cars they aren\xe2\x80\x99t yet an uncomplicated positive.\n\nResearch and development is proceeding anyway, mostly because self-driving cars will probably be a gold mine for the first company to get them on the road. They\xe2\x80\x99ll likely be able to establish themselves in ride-hailing, taxi, and trucking markets while competitors are still struggling to catch up, and then they\xe2\x80\x99ll benefit from the additional miles traveled to further improve their cars.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not uncommon for a technology to be dangerous and barely worth it when it is first invented, only to eventually be refined into a valuable part of modern life. The first airplanes were dangerous and commercially useless, but we improved things dramatically from there.\n\n8) What role does policy play in the development of self-driving cars?\n\nThere is no federal law regarding self-driving cars. Much of the action on policy has largely taken place at the state level. And the laws surrounding self-driving cars vary enormously by state, with 29 states having passed legislation.\n\nSelf-driving car development mostly happens in the states that have been friendliest to it \xe2\x80\x94 especially California and Arizona \xe2\x80\x94 and it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to envision some states banning self-driving cars long after they become commonplace in other states, especially if the safety case for them isn\xe2\x80\x99t a slam-dunk.\n\nWhen self-driving cars were first proposed, I heard a lot of worries that regulators would unnecessarily delay their implementation. By 2016, it was obvious that hadn\xe2\x80\x99t come to pass. Indeed, in some cases regulators may have been too permissive \xe2\x80\x94 for example, in light of Uber pulling its cars and instituting new safety procedures, it seems the vehicle that killed Elaine Herzberg probably shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been on the road at all.\n\nPolicy might also shape whether self-driving cars are good or bad for the environment. With high taxes on gasoline, for example, the social costs of carbon emissions could be reflected in the price of using self-driving cars \xe2\x80\x94 and the money can be spent on climate adaptation and clean energy. But right now, our transportation policy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do much of anything about the social costs of driving, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a problem that will only get worse if self-driving cars put more people on the road.\n\n9) So just when are we getting self-driving cars?\n\nIn some senses, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been \xe2\x80\x9cclose\xe2\x80\x9d on self-driving cars for years now. Waymo is doing test runs with no one behind the wheel in Arizona, which it\xe2\x80\x99s been doing since 2017. Cruise delayed the 2019 launch of its autonomous taxi service but thinks it might happen in 2020. Earlier this year, the company unveiled a car with no steering wheel ... and no timetable for when it\xe2\x80\x99ll be available for sale. Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s periodic software updates make its Autopilot highway self-driving work better, but it remains well short of full self-driving.\n\nThere are certainly skeptics. Recently, the CEO of Volkswagen said that fully self-driving cars might \xe2\x80\x9cnever happen.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThat might be an overly harsh forecast, considering the progress that\xe2\x80\x99s been made. But it is exasperatingly difficult to get a good estimate of how long until self-driving cars happen for real for the typical American, both because no one knows for sure and because companies have incentives to publicize optimistic estimates. The companies boast about their progress but don\xe2\x80\x99t publish their mishaps. Timelines slip, and the change in plans is often publicly acknowledged only long after it\xe2\x80\x99s become obvious that the deadline can\xe2\x80\x99t be met.\n\nAt the same time, companies hesitate to put their cars on the road when there\xe2\x80\x99s any chance they aren\xe2\x80\x99t ready. They are well aware that killing someone, as Uber did, is not only horrible but also probably spells doom for their business. So there\xe2\x80\x99s ample incentive to say optimistic things and not actually launch.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not hard to imagine their arrival later this year, at least in sufficiently limited contexts; it\xe2\x80\x99s also not hard to imagine that the deadlines will be pushed out another three or four years.\n\nSelf-driving cars are on their way. They\xe2\x80\x99re closer than they were a year ago. When they\xe2\x80\x99ll actually get here is anyone\xe2\x80\x99s guess.\n\nSign up for the Future Perfect newsletter and we\xe2\x80\x99ll send you a roundup of ideas and solutions for tackling the world\xe2\x80\x99s biggest challenges \xe2\x80\x94 and how to get better at doing good.\n\nvox-mark Sign up for the newsletter Future Perfect Each week, we explore unique solutions to some of the world's biggest problems.

"117.txt";"b'It was seven years ago when Waymo discovered that spring blossoms made its self-driving cars get twitchy on the brakes. So did soap bubbles. And road flares.\n\nNew tests, in years of tests, revealed more and more distractions for the driverless cars. Their road skills improved, but matching the competence of human drivers was elusive. The cluttered roads of America, it turned out, were a daunting place for a robot.\n\nThe wizards of Silicon Valley said people would be commuting to work in self-driving cars by now. Instead, there have been court fights, injuries and deaths, and tens of billions of dollars spent on a frustratingly fickle technology that some researchers say is still years from becoming the industry\xe2\x80\x99s next big thing.\n\nNow the pursuit of autonomous cars is undergoing a reset. Companies like Uber and Lyft, worried about blowing through their cash in pursuit of autonomous technology, have tapped out. Only the deepest-pocketed outfits like Waymo, which is a subsidiary of Google\xe2\x80\x99s parent company, Alphabet; auto giants; and a handful of start-ups are managing to stay in the game.'";"Autonomous Cars";"117.txt-Autonomous Cars"
"118.txt";"b'What are the challenges with autonomous cars?\n\nFully autonomous (Level 5) cars are undergoing testing in several pockets of the world, but none are yet available to the general public. We\xe2\x80\x99re still years away from that. The challenges range from the technological and legislative to the environmental and philosophical. Here are just some of the unknowns.\n\nLidar and Radar\n\nLidar is expensive and is still trying to strike the right balance between range and resolution. If multiple autonomous cars were to drive on the same road, would their lidar signals interfere with one another? And if multiple radio frequencies are available, will the frequency range be enough to support mass production of autonomous cars?\n\nWeather Conditions\n\nWhat happens when an autonomous car drives in heavy precipitation? If there\xe2\x80\x99s a layer of snow on the road, lane dividers disappear. How will the cameras and sensors track lane markings if the markings are obscured by water, oil, ice, or debris?\n\nTraffic Conditions and Laws\n\nWill autonomous cars have trouble in tunnels or on bridges? How will they do in bumper-to-bumper traffic? Will autonomous cars be relegated to a specific lane? Will they be granted carpool lane access? And what about the fleet of legacy cars still sharing the roadways for the next 20 or 30 years?\n\nState vs. Federal Regulation\n\nThe regulatory process in the U.S. has recently shifted from federal guidance to state-by-state mandates for autonomous cars. Some states have even proposed a per-mile tax on autonomous vehicles to prevent the rise of \xe2\x80\x9czombie cars\xe2\x80\x9d driving around without passengers. Lawmakers have also written bills proposing that all autonomous cars must be zero-emission vehicles and have a panic button installed. But are the laws going to be different from state to state? Will you be able to cross state lines with an autonomous car?\n\nAccident Liability\n\nWho is liable for accidents caused by an autonomous car? The manufacturer? The human passenger? The latest blueprints suggest that a fully autonomous Level 5 car will not have a dashboard or a steering wheel, so a human passenger would not even have the option to take control of the vehicle in an emergency.\n\nArtificial vs. Emotional Intelligence\n\nHuman drivers rely on subtle cues and non-verbal communication\xe2\x80\x94like making eye contact with pedestrians or reading the facial expressions and body language of other drivers\xe2\x80\x94to make split-second judgment calls and predict behaviors. Will autonomous cars be able to replicate this connection? Will they have the same life-saving instincts as human drivers?'";"Autonomous Cars";"118.txt-Autonomous Cars"
"119.txt";"b""Imagine getting into your car, typing\xe2\x80\x94or, better yet speaking\xe2\x80\x94a location into your vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s interface, then letting it drive you to your destination while you read a book, surf the web, or nap. Self-driving vehicles\xe2\x80\x94the stuff of science fiction since the first roads were paved\xe2\x80\x94are coming, and they\xe2\x80\x99re going to radically change what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to get from point A to point B.\n\nIn 2009, Google started the self-driving car project with the goal of driving autonomously over ten uninterrupted 100-mile routes. In 2016, Waymo, an autonomous driving technology company, became a subsidiary of Alphabet, and Google's self-driving project became Waymo.\n\nSince then, Waymo has invited the public to join the first public trial of autonomous vehicles operated by the Waymo Driver and introduced its first fully autonomous vehicles operated by the Waymo Driver on public roads without anyone in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat.\n\nKey Takeaways The hype around driverless cars has grown rapidly over the past several years, with many big technology companies getting behind the concept.\n\nGoogle launched its Waymo division to develop and market consumer-ready driverless vehicles around the globe.\n\nThe company, along with several others in the tech and auto industries, is betting that driverless cars will soon change the way we get around in a major way.\n\nAmong the revolutionary changes will be safer roads, fewer fossil fuels, and lower transportation costs.\n\nBasic Technology Already In Use\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe building blocks of driverless cars are on the road now,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Russ Rader, senior vice president of communications at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf. He pointed to the front-crash prevention systems that for several years have been able to warn drivers of an impending obstacle and apply the brakes if they don\xe2\x80\x99t react fast enough.\n\nThese systems were quickly followed by technology that allows cars to self-park by sizing up a free spot and automatically steering into it, with the driver only controlling the accelerator and brake pedals. Mercedes-Benz took autonomous driving even further when they introduced Drive Pilot, which allows the driver to hand over direct control of steering and speed in certain circumstances, while still supervising the overall operation of the car.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nIn 2018, Waymo announced that they would be making self-driving cars available by 2020. However, despite some extraordinary advancements, in the year 2020, self-driving cars are still out of reach, except in some trial programs.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf The current technology on the market is limited to cars that will automatically brake for you if they anticipate a collision, cars that help keep you in your lane, and cars that can mostly handle highway driving.\n\nThe idea behind self-driving cars is fairly simple: build a car with cameras that can track all the objects around it. The car should react if it\xe2\x80\x99s about to steer into one. And once in-car computers know all driving rules, they should be able to navigate to their destination. In the end, you might say that the execution of these ideas has been more complicated than was anticipated.\n\nWaymo's cars, the leader in self-driving technology, use high-resolution cameras and lidar (light detection and ranging, which is a way of estimating the distance to another object by bouncing light and sound off things). This technology helps the self-driving car identify where other cars, cyclists, pedestrians, and obstacles are and where they\xe2\x80\x99re moving.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nA Drastic Change\n\nWith the adoption of any new revolutionary technology, it is predicted there will be problems for businesses that don\xe2\x80\x99t adjust fast enough to future developments in self-driving car technology. Futurists estimate that hundreds of billions of dollars (if not trillions) will be lost by automakers, suppliers, dealers, insurers, parking companies, and many other car-related enterprises. And think of the lost revenue for governments via licensing fees, taxes and tolls, and by personal injury lawyers and health insurers.\n\nWho needs a car made with heavier-gauge steel and eight airbags (not to mention a body shop) if accidents are so rare? Who needs a parking spot close to work if your car can drive you there, park itself miles away, only to pick you up later? Who needs to buy a flight from Boston to Cleveland when you can leave in the evening, sleep much of the way, and arrive in the morning?\n\nIndeed, one of Google\xe2\x80\x99s goals is to facilitate car-sharing.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf That means fewer cars on the road. Fewer cars, period. Who needs to own a car when you can just order a shared one and it\xe2\x80\x99ll drive up minutes later, ready to take you wherever you want?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis [has the potential to] dramatically reduce the number of cars on the street, 80% of which have people driving alone in them, and also a household's cost of transportation, which is 18% of their income\xe2\x80\x94around $9,000 a year\xe2\x80\x94for an asset that they use only 5% of the time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Robin Chase, the founder and CEO of Buzzcar, a peer-to-peer car-sharing service, and co-founder and former CEO of Zipcar.\n\nIn 2030, self-driving cars are expected to create $87 billion worth of opportunities for automakers and technology developers, said a report by Boston-based Lux Research.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf Software developers stand to win big.\n\nA Manufacturing Revolution\n\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re an automaker, such as Ford Motor Co. (F), General Motors Co. (GM), Chrysler Group LLC, Toyota Motor Corp. or Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (HMC), which account for almost 70% of the U.S. market, you could see an initial surge in the $600 billion in annual new and used car sales globally.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf \xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf But as soon as the technology takes hold, sales could fall off significantly as sharing popularizes.\n\nCars will always need steel, glass, an interior, a drivetrain, and some form of human interface (even if that interface is little more than a wireless connection to your smartphone). But much of everything else could change. As an example, take front-facing seats; they could become an option, not a requirement. Automakers that see the changes coming\xe2\x80\x94such as how the big profits are secured downstream by car servicers, insurers, and more\xe2\x80\x94are focusing on services as much as on what and how they manufacture.\n\nInfrastructure Transformation\n\nWith fewer cars around, parking lots and spaces that cover roughly one-third of the land area of many U.S. cities can be repurposed. That could mean temporary downward pressure on real estate values as supply increases. It could also mean greener urban areas and revitalized suburbs if longer commutes become more palatable. And if fewer cars are on the road, federal, state, and local government agencies may be able to reallocate a good portion of the roughly $180 billion spent annually on highways and roads.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nChanging Oil Demand\n\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re in the business of finding, extracting, refining, and marketing hydrocarbons, such as Exxon Mobil (EOX), Chevron (CVX), or BP (BP), you could see your business fluctuate as use changes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese vehicles should practice very efficient eco-driving practices, which is typically about 20% better than the average driver,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chase. \xe2\x80\x9cOn the other hand, if these cars are owned by individuals, I see a huge rise in the number of trips, and vehicle miles traveled. People will send out their car to run errands they would never do if they had to be in the car and waste their own time. If the autonomous cars are shared vehicles and people pay for each trip, I think this will reduce demand, and thus (vehicle miles traveled).\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSafety Dividend\n\nAutonomous vehicles are also expected to be safer. \xe2\x80\x9cThese cars won't get drunk or high, drive too fast, or take unnecessary risks\xe2\x80\x94things people do all the time,\xe2\x80\x9d Chase said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOver 90% of accidents today are caused by driver error,\xe2\x80\x9d said Professor Robert W. Peterson of the Center for Insurance Law and Regulation at Santa Clara University School of Law. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is every reason to believe that self-driving cars will reduce the frequency and severity of accidents, so insurance costs should fall, perhaps dramatically.\xe2\x80\x9d\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCars can still get flooded, damaged, or stolen,\xe2\x80\x9d notes Michael Barry, vice president of media relations at the Insurance Information Institute. \xe2\x80\x9cBut this technology will have a dramatic impact on underwriting. A lot of traditional underwriting criteria will be upended.\xe2\x80\x9d\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nBarry said it\xe2\x80\x99s too early to quantify exactly how self-driving vehicles will affect rates, but added that injured parties in a crash involving a self-driving car may choose to sue the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s manufacturer or the software company that designed the autonomous capability.\n\nInitially, insurers such as State Farm Insurance, Allstate Corp. (ALL), Liberty Mutual Group, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\xe2\x80\x99s (BRK-A) GEICO, Citigroup Inc.\xe2\x80\x99s (C) Travelers Group could see a huge benefit from lower accident liabilities. But they may wind up losing a big portion of the $200 billion in personal auto premiums they write every year as fewer cars take to the road.\n\nSome experts have even speculated that mandatory insurance for cars could be dropped. And as long as we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about financial services, what about the multitude of banks and creditors that lend buyers money in about 85% of car purchases if sales volume falls?\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nAccording to a University of Texas report, if only 10% of the cars on U.S. roads were autonomous, almost $30 billion of savings could be realized via less wasted time and fuel, as well as fewer injuries and deaths. At 90%, the benefit rises to almost $120 billion a year.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nCloser to Home\n\nSelf-driving cars could have a substantial impact on the taxi and limousine industries and could potentially create new ones. Chase noted that they could be used to share specific trips, as a kind of pay-as-you-go small-scale public transportation\xe2\x80\x94for example, taking a disparate bunch of Manhattanites to the same beach in the Hamptons in one trip.\n\nOne study found that a fleet of 9,000 driverless taxis could serve all of Manhattan at about $0.50 per mile (compared to about $5 per mile now). At the time the study was published, there were licenses for over 13,000 taxis in New York City.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nSelf-driving cars may also challenge train lines. \xe2\x80\x9cA self-driving car offers much of the convenience of rail service with the added convenience that the service is portal-to-portal rather than station-to-station,\xe2\x80\x9d Peterson said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the other hand, a fleet of self-driving cars available at the station may make rail service more palatable. \xe2\x80\x9cThe technology has already been adopted in closed systems, such as campuses, air-terminals, and mining,\xe2\x80\x9d he noted. \xe2\x80\x9cRio Tinto Group (RIO), a large mining company, uses enormous self-driving trucks in its mining operations. European countries are experimenting with the platooning of trucks. Among other things, this saves about 18% in fuel.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRisks and Hurdles\n\nThere are regulatory and legislative obstacles to the widespread use of self-driving cars and substantial concerns about privacy. (Who will have access to any driving information these vehicles store?) There\xe2\x80\x99s also the question of security, as hackers could theoretically take control of these vehicles, and are not known for their restraint or civic-mindedness.\n\nThe Future of Waymo\n\nIn March 2020, Waymo Via, the trucking division of Waymo, was launched. According to Google, since 2017 Waymo Driver had been learning to drive large Class 8 trucks in the same way that it had learned how to drive passenger vehicles. Waymo is currently testing its fleet of trucks in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, and has launched a pilot program for local delivery in the Phoenix, Arizona area.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nWaymo has partnerships with multiple vehicle manufacturers to integrate its technology. In October 2020, Waymo and Daimler Trucks partnered to create an autonomous version of the Freightliner Cascadia truck. This is Waymo's first foray into the freight industry. Daimler's trucks will be equipped with autonomous technology that allows them to drive without a human but only in pre-defined areas.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nGoogle\xe2\x80\x99s Self-Driving Car FAQs\n\nIs Google Making a Car?\n\nGoogle has made it clear that it has no plans to build cars itself. Waymo is a self-driving technology company; it does not intend to manufacture and sell its own line of vehicles.\n\nWhat Year Will There Be Self-Driving Cars?\n\nEarly estimates about self-driving cars being the norm by 2020 have turned into having a few research vehicles on the road by 2020. Even if the technology is not developing as fast as expected, computer-processing capabilities and sophisticated artificial intelligence systems are becoming more advanced and more affordable every year. It's not clear when all the pieces will truly fall into place to allow for driverless technologies to safely navigate public roads among traditional cars. While experts agree that there will be a time in the future when this is true, they disagree on the timeline.\n\nHow Much Does the Google Car Cost?\n\nGoogle does not manufacture or sell its own cars. However, you can purchase a semi-autonomous Honda Civic that comes with advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) that control the steering, lane changing, acceleration, and braking while the car is cruising on the highway. You can also purchase a Tesla Motors vehicle that comes equipped with its semi-autonomous Autopilot feature.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nHowever it plays out, these vehicles are coming\xe2\x80\x94and fast. Their full adoption will take decades, but their convenience, cost, safety, and other factors will make them ubiquitous and indispensable. Such as with any technological revolution, the companies that plan ahead, adjust the fastest, and imagine the biggest will survive and thrive. And companies invested in old technology and practices will need to evolve or risk dying.""";"Autonomous Cars";"119.txt-Autonomous Cars"

While the relative timing and scale of economic growth is not yet clear\xe2\x80\x94and subject to some debate among scholars\xe2\x80\x94a key step in maximizing the benefits of AVs is passing federal legislation, rather than relying on a patchwork of state and local guidelines. To inform the debate and help prepare policymakers for the task at hand, this report will examine the state of AVs, the potential for them to become a \xe2\x80\x9ckiller app\xe2\x80\x9d with broad impacts, and the existing and potential regulations that could ensure net positive effects on the economy and society as a whole.\n\nThe current state and future of AVs\n\nThe current standards for autonomous driving were developed by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE International). According to the SAE standard, the automation capability of vehicles ranges from Level 0, with no autonomy, to Level 5, which is full automation. Level 1 features include park assist, lane assist and adaptive cruise control. Some Level 3 vehicles, which include full self-driving capabilities but require human intervention in complex situations such as traffic jams, may be commercially available in 2021. No Level 4 or 5 cars, which would not require any human intervention, are yet certified for use on regular roads, though there are some such as Google\xe2\x80\x99s Waymo that are in development.\n\nWhile the potential impacts of AVs are substantial, it will take time for them to be realized; AVs are still some years from being commercially available, let alone in widespread use. To give a reasonable sense of timing, Chris Urmson\xe2\x80\x94a DARPA challenge winner, head of Google\xe2\x80\x99s Waymo autonomous vehicle unit for many years, and now CEO of a self-driving vehicle software company named Aurora \xe2\x80\x94argues it may take up to 30 to 50 years before widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles. Despite predictions to the contrary\xe2\x80\x94e.g., Elon Musk\xe2\x80\x99s 2019 prediction that there would be a Tesla driverless taxi fleet in some regions by 2020\xe2\x80\x94time frames of this magnitude are common in the automobile industry. Choe, Oettl and Seamans (2021) report that widespread adoption of new innovations in the automobile sector historically can take several decades.1 There are a number of factors that contribute to technology adoption, and even if a new technology is feasible, it may not be available at a price point that many consumers will pay. For example, turbo-charged engines, which help to reduce the amount of fuel needed, did not start to become popular until oil prices started to rise in the 1970s.\n\nIn short, the timing of adoption of AVs and the economic impacts that will follow depend on many factors. For regulators and policymakers interested in shaping what will likely be considerable economic and societal impacts of AVs, now is the time.\n\nEffect on our economy and society\n\nSupporters of autonomous vehicles argue that they may provide a variety of benefits including fuel efficiency and safety. Indeed, the Brookings Institution recently published a book on the topic (Winston and Karpilow, 2020).2 The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) argues that AVs are more fuel efficient than human-driven cars, which means fewer emissions. However, AVs may increase vehicle traffic, potentially nullifying emissions reduction from fuel efficiency. Kroger, Kuhnimhof, and Trommer (2019) project the adoption of autonomous vehicle technologies may increase vehicle traffic by 2-9 percent as a result of new automobile user groups as well as lower generalized costs of car travel.3\n\nAVs will likely be safer than human-driven cars, in large part through reducing human error which the National Highway Traffic Safety Association (NHTSA) estimates accounts for 94 percent of crashes. While widespread adoption of AVs should ultimately result in safer roads, there have been several high profile accidents involving AVs, such as a Waymo van that crashed into a car in Arizona. Perhaps as a result of some of these high-profile accidents, consumer demand for AVs seems to be relatively low. According to a 2021 survey by the American Automobile Association, only 14 percent of drivers report that they would trust riding in a vehicle that drives itself, a response similar to the 2020 survey. It is possible, however, that consumer attitudes will change once Level 4 and 5 vehicles become commercially available.\n\nAVs may help to reduce labor input costs in driving-intensive industries. However, as Gittleman and Monaco (2017) point out, there are several types of drivers, and autonomous driving will likely affect some types more than others.4 Autonomous vehicles are more likely to be used for heavy and tractor trailer truck purposes (aka \xe2\x80\x9clong haul\xe2\x80\x9d) than local delivery given the relative ease of navigating on highways and all the other tasks associated with local delivery, including freight handling, paperwork, and customer service. Gittleman and Monaco estimate that Level 4 and 5 automation may ultimately displace 300,000 to 400,000 drivers. But the authors highlight that there are many practical limitations to automation. For example, they highlight that one of the important functions of a truck driver is to serve as a security guard for the freight.\n\nA recent paper by Gelauff, Ossokina, and Teulings (2019) envisions some of the longer-term outcomes from AVs.5 The authors model two countervailing effects from AVs, each of which lead to differing outcomes on population distribution. On one hand, AVs may lead to improved use of time during car trips, which lowers the cost of living at a distance from cities. On the other hand, AVs may lead to improved public transit options in urban environments in the form of shared-ride autonomous vehicles (SAVs). The authors argue that SAVs may be more efficient than existing public transit and may make city living relatively more attractive leading to more population clustering in cities. The authors argue that the second effect may outweigh the first and ultimately may lead to overall population shifts towards large, attractive cities at the expense of smaller urban and non-urban areas. While the authors don\xe2\x80\x99t speculate on the ultimate economic effects of such a change, it is worth noting that literature from economic geography suggests that there are many agglomeration effects from living in or close to cities, including greater economic growth and innovation.6 It is also worth noting that the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a large shift in population away from many urban environments, at least in the short run.\n\nIn short, AVs will likely affect our economy and society in a variety of ways. AVs may lead to fewer emissions and increased safety. By decreasing the need for humans to drive, AVs will likely transform the type of work done by humans in the transportation sector of the economy and may also change the way that humans commute to and from work. How all this plays out, however, depends on numerous factors including, importantly, existing and future regulations.\n\nCurrent and prospective AV legislation\n\nThe National Conference of State Legislatures highlights that a number of states have introduced and enacted laws related to autonomous vehicles. Notably, in December 2020, California State Senator Ben Allen introduced a bill to establish a new Council on the Future of Transportation in California that would promote state legislation for autonomous vehicles, in addition to other transportation-related policy. Also, in November 2020 the California Public Utilities Commission approved autonomous vehicle regulatory framework that would make it easier for companies to provide autonomous vehicle transportation services to the public. While these laws indicate that state legislators are responsive to local concerns about autonomous vehicles, the risk is a resulting patchwork of state laws.\n\nWith this concern in mind, there have been attempts at federal legislation, notably in 2017 with the SELF DRIVE Act in the House and the AV START Act in the Senate. The SELF DRIVE Act (Safely Ensuring Lives Future Deployment and Research In Vehicle Evolution Act) was passed in the House in 2017 but did not advance in the Senate. The bill would have provided NHTSA with the authority to regulate AVs. NHTSA would be authorized to require safety assessment certifications and states would be preempted from enacting laws regarding the design, construction, or performance of AVs unless those laws enact standards identical to federal standards. In addition, the bill would have required that manufacturers of AVs develop written cybersecurity and privacy plans for such vehicles prior to offering them for sale. The AV START Act (American Vision for Safer Transportation through Advancement of Revolutionary Technologies Act) was introduced in the Senate in 2017 but did not advance. Like the SELF DRIVE Act, it would have established a framework for a federal role in oversight of AVs, preempting state laws and providing clarity to stakeholders including car manufacturers and insurance companies.\n\nIt remains to be seen when federal legislation on AVs will be passed, although there are promising signs. Reportedly, there is currently bipartisan support for federal legislation, notably from Republican Senator John Thune and Democratic Senator Gary Peters (who were co-sponsors of the AV START Act). While the Biden administration did not mention autonomous vehicles in its recently proposed infrastructure and jobs plan (instead focusing on electric vehicles and charging stations), Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has stated, \xe2\x80\x9cAutomated vehicle technology is coming, it\xe2\x80\x99s advancing very quickly, it is something that holds the potential to be transformative, and I think in many ways policy has not kept up.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nExisting regulatory barriers: Spectrum\n\nOne important issue to be resolved is around communication standards between autonomous vehicles. The 5.9 GHz spectrum, a 75 MHz band, had initially been set aside for use for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications in 1999, and NHTSA, car manufacturers, and device manufacturers spent the ensuing two decades working on a standard for V2V communications. However, the standard that emerged, called Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC), continues to face considerable resistance, including from a competing standard called Cellular-Vehicle-to-Vehicle (C-V2V). DSRC allows direct communication between two DSRC-enabled devices without relying on an intermediary, such as a cellular network, which in principle makes it fast and deployable in areas without cellular coverage. However, research by Gyawali et al (2020) suggests that DSRC only works well when two vehicles are in sight of each other and not moving too fast.7 C-V2V operates through a cellular network, which may limit its ability to function well in remote areas but handles communications between vehicles that are moving quickly (Gyawali et al 2020).\n\nSeparately, Wi-Fi demands have been growing, and the 5.9 GHz spectrum is increasingly being used for unlicensed Wi-Fi. A 2018 study by Rand Corporation estimated that the value of the consumer and producer surplus from using the entire band for Wi-Fi to be between $82.2 billion and $189.9 billion. In November 2019 Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Ajit Pai announced a plan whereby 45 MHz at the lower end of the band will be made available for Wi-Fi, the next 20 MHz for C-V2V, and the top 10 MHz potentially for C-V2V or DSRC. In November 2020 the FCC voted in favor of the proposal, despite objections by the Trump administration\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Transportation. There are calls for the Biden administration to reverse the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s decision. The plan would seem to bolster the C-V2V standard relative to DSRC, which may hasten resolution of the standards battle, and also favors use of Wi-Fi over transportation. It will be important for policymakers to consider the tradeoffs associated with use of the spectrum. On the one hand, demand for spectrum for Wi-Fi enabled devices is a growing and current need. In contrast, there is currently little need for spectrum for autonomous vehicles\xe2\x80\x94there aren\xe2\x80\x99t any commercially available and consumer demand seems low. On the other hand, spectrum for autonomous vehicles will likely be a future need, and the economic benefits of autonomous vehicles may outweigh the benefits of additional Wi-Fi.\n\nConclusion\n\nAutonomous vehicles will likely transform our economy, including changing the role of humans in transportation-related industries and potentially reducing emissions and increasing safety, all of which should ultimately lead to economic growth. However, large-scale adoption of autonomous vehicles and the ensuing economic growth will likely take time. The technology is still in development and consumers remain wary of autonomous vehicles. Moreover, federal and state legislation is still nascent, and there are competing standards for communication between vehicles. All of this needs to be resolved before AVs can become a \xe2\x80\x9ckiller app.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEditor\xe2\x80\x99s Note: This paper was updated from a previous version to reflect a change in Tesla vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s SAE automation level from 3 to 2.\n\nThe authors did not receive financial support from any firm or person for this article or from any firm or person with a financial or political interest in this article.

"121.txt";"b'Why Driverless Cars?\n\nThe idea of an \xe2\x80\x9cautonomous\xe2\x80\x9d vehicle that can navigate without human intervention fascinates consumers, and they enjoy watching videos of motorists working on a laptop or reading the newspaper while riding passively in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat.\n\nOn the technology side, much attention has been given to how these vehicles navigate using sophisticated sensors paired with map information, satellite location signals and tremendous computing power. However, the real story is the potential benefits to consumers that could come from automated vehicles. These include:\n\nFewer Crashes: According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, more than 35,000 lives were lost on U.S. highways in 2015. In addition, the economic and societal costs of collisions are a staggering $836 billion per year.

Road Use Efficiency: Autonomous vehicles will support more widespread use of car sharing, reducing the total number of vehicles on the road. Self-driving vehicles can also operate with less space between cars than is needed to allow for human driver reaction times. As a result, more vehicles can be accommodated on each mile of roadway, and could help identify specific areas for additional infrastructure.\n\nHowever, all of these benefits depend on a number of factors: achieving a critical mass of reliable autonomous vehicles that minimizes human input on driving, and creating interoperable and cooperative systems where vehicles and infrastructure can communicate in order to create more efficient traffic management, and consumer acceptance. These could be decades away.\n\nAutomated Vehicles to Hit the Road by 2020? Not So Fast\n\nWhen automakers and tech companies talk about Level 5 or fully self \xe2\x80\x93 driving vehicles, they aren\xe2\x80\x99t trying to find cars in a parking garage. Instead, modern vehicles are categorized by the level of autonomous technology they offer. Levels start at 0, for cars with no autonomous controls, and rise to Level 5 for cars that can perform all driving tasks and monitor the driving environment under all conditions in which a human driver could do the same.\n\nAutomakers and their partners, technology companies and research institutions are all working to develop self-driving technology and some experts say Level 5 vehicles could be on the road by 2020. In truth, autonomous technology exists on the road today in the form of safety features like adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking or lane keeping technologies that monitor the road and intervene when necessary.\n\nSome companies are already testing Level 4 or 5 vehicles, but these advanced technologies face technical challenges and human issues involving how drivers will interface with self-driving cars. Meanwhile, federal and state governments are determining how to adapt existing safety, licensing and liability laws and regulations to accommodate self-driving vehicles. As consumers slowly replace old cars with new cars, the U.S. will likely see a mix of vehicles with differing levels of automation on our roads for decades.\n\nAAA Q&A on Self-Driving Cars\n\nGreg Brannon has a bird\xe2\x80\x99s eye view of advancements in autonomous vehicles.

"132.txt";"b'Only a few years ago self-driving cars were no more than a vision in a science fiction movie. Today, the first partially automated vehicles with various assistance systems can already be seen on our roads. Autonomous driving is also no longer just a dream.\n\nAutonomous means that the car is fully independent in making decisions and responding to situations, including emergencies; no driver and no external intervention are needed. Enabling an even faster connection between transport systems, the 5G network will offer new application options advancing the development of autonomous cars. Not only will they be able to make autonomous decisions in the future, they will also communicate and cooperate with each other. Automated driving is the term used to describe a scenario where a fully interconnected and intelligent road transport system is created as a result of these capabilities.\n\n5G network as important foundation for autonomous driving\n\nIntelligent transport infrastructure through interconnectedness\n\nThe foundations for autonomous driving are fast and reliable communication networks, such as LTE and 5G. Therefore, Deutsche Telekom plans to install the 5G network on all key transport routes \xe2\x80\x93 such as freeways, main roads, and rail tracks \xe2\x80\x93 by 2025. Experts from various sectors are working at the 5G Automotive Association (5GAA), defining the basics for common standards in order to ensure that the new mobile communication standard meets the specific requirements for interconnecting the various transport users and for automated driving.\n\nThanks to wireless technology and internet connection, connected cars with their digital and location-related services can greatly improve our driving comfort. The car relies on regular data updates for navigation, e.g. detailed road maps, plus updates in unexpected traffic situations, such as congestion, rain, or black ice. In combination with apps for the driver and cloud systems, information for maintenance or other status reports can be retrieved and sent. Thanks to mobile edge computing, these functions are already realized today, based on LTE at a transmission rate of up to 300 megabit per second and latencies of less than 100 milliseconds, even in emergencies or remote-controlled driving at low speeds. 5G will offer even higher quality for many digital in-car services in the future.\n\n5G network expands automated systems\n\nSafety aspects are of course also a focus of attention for driving a car. In addition to the 4G capabilities, 5G offers special features for safety-relevant requirements that no other wireless network can provide.\n\nAutomated systems reach their limits when unexpected or unknown situations occur. In such a case an ""autopilot"" will decide to deactivate the system for safety reasons, if in doubt. An automated car would then return the task and responsibility of driving to the human driver. However, if the vehicle is not taken over by the driver, or not as quickly as required, then the car will be moved to the roadside in a secure driving mode.\n\nWith 5G, the car could, for instance, be controlled remotely by an external operator acting as traffic controller. The remote control through an operator is, however, definitely impossible without a 5G network, which offers key features such as very short response times and guaranteed network resources.\n\nBenefits of 5G for autonomous driving\n\nOne huge benefit of 5G is what is known as network slicing. The wireless network is subdivided into virtual network levels. One network level is then used only for automated driving, for instance. This ensures that safety-relevant notifications to self-driving cars will not end up in a traffic jam on the data highway and will be given priority over other infotainment services used in parallel.\n\nAnother benefit is the data processing and storage in data centers that are in close proximity to the transport routes. Such ""edge"" data centers ensure that data can be processed even faster in the network. In initial 5G tests on the A9 freeway between Nuremberg and Munich, latencies of less than 20 milliseconds were achieved. An autonomous car driving at a speed of 100 km/h would have traveled a mere 60 centimeters in that time. The virtual network levels and short transmission paths guarantee important quality features of the 5G mobile technology, such as low latencies and high bandwidths.\n\nSensors are used to implement car-to-car communication for automated driving. This includes, for example, intelligent camera systems, which enable the direct exchange of data between the cars. These systems have crucial physical disadvantages, however. They can neither look around corners, nor over hills, nor through obstacles. This is why they restrict the functioning of self-driving cars. This simple form of automation is also unsuitable at higher speeds.\n\nThis is where the 5G network offers another huge advantage. The mobile technology expands the scope of autonomous mobility through direct and, above all, fast and broadband data communication with cars and an appropriately equipped transport infrastructure, such as traffic lights. This can ensure improved traffic flows, for example by enabling cars to travel at higher speeds or reducing their speed in good time when necessary.\n\nAutomated driving has already begun with assisted driving\n\nThe automation of vehicles happens gradually, however. Fully automated driving, which can operate reliably in a large number of driving situations, is only the final stage of a long-lasting process. Half of all cars are already equipped with intelligent assistance systems. These are digital navigations systems, parking assistance, or speed regulation systems using cruise control as well as distance-regulation systems. Functions of an autonomous steering system for cars are already partially performed by driver assistance systems, such as steering and lane keeping assistants. Cars that can park themselves are also already available today. Despite these assistants it is the driver who remains responsible at all times. If, however, the vehicle is fully automated, the responsibility shifts from the driver to the means of transport and consequently to its manufacturer or operator. This is why many of the automation functions will at first be limited to sufficiently controllable driving situations, such as driving at lower and medium speeds on freeways or parking in a demarcated parking space.\n\nAutomatism creates personal freedoms\n\nHumans use automated functions in their day-to-day lives mainly in order to save time, which can then be used in a more meaningful or convenient way. So in the future \xe2\x80\x93 as mere passengers in self-driving cars \xe2\x80\x93 making use of mobile networks, we will surely be able to read the latest news on our smartphones or tablets, participate in video conferences or work, use entertainment services or shop online while on the move.

Automated vehicles could eliminate the majority of these crashes.\n\nWhile automated vehicle systems require much more testing and validation before they are ready for commercial deployment, engineers are working to ensure they drive safely, closely follow traffic laws, and respond appropriately to changing road conditions. Automated vehicles do not get distracted and can monitor their environment in 360-degree, high-precision 3D.\n\nAutomated vehicles can also provide increased mobility to seniors, children, people with disabilities and others who are unable or choose not to drive. They could operate more efficiently than conventional vehicles, reducing congestion and emissions.\n\nSAE, the Society of Automotive Engineers, identified six levels of vehicle automation starting with Level 0, or no automation whatsoever, through Level 5, in which the vehicle has complete control. SAE, the Society of Automotive Engineers, identified six levels of vehicle automation starting with Level 0, or no automation whatsoever, through Level 5, in which the vehicle has complete control.\n\nYou might already be driving a vehicle that is above Level 0. Level 1 automation includes automatic transmission, lane-keeping technologies and assisted cruise control. Level 2 includes some of these technologies working in conjunction (such as in Tesla\'s autopilot mode). It is Levels 3 through 5 where the Office of Innovative Funding is focusing its attention.\n\n\n\nOregon\'s Task Force on Autonomous Vehicles Created by\n\nCreated by House Bill 4063 , signed by Gov. Kate Brown on April 10, 2018, ODOT was named the state\'s lead agency on automated vehicle policy (as recommended by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration). It also directed ODOT to facilitate a Task Force on Autonomous Vehicles and report to the legislature with legislative recommendations. Per HB 4063, the task force dissolved in January 2021.\n\nThe Task Force issued two reports: September 2018 Report\n\n\n\nSeptember 2019 Report Members of the task force were:\n\nChair: Lt.

We have a voluntary testing notification form to initiate the exchange of information between AV manufacturers and the agency.\n\nOregon does not currently regulate AV testing, but the voluntary notification process allows ODOT to provide safety information to interested companies on work zones and lane closures on proposed test routes and dates. It also enables us to solicit feedback from AV system developers on how to engage the industry, and to track the progress of AV testing in the state.\n\nLevels of automation'";"Autonomous Cars";"133.txt-Autonomous Cars"

"140.txt";"b'By Erick Guerra\n\nAlthough technological, financial, and regulatory hurdles remain, fully autonomous vehicles will likely be driving themselves on city streets and highways in the next 20 years \xe2\x80\x94 well within a long-range planning horizon. Major car manufacturers already market and sell high-end vehicles with features like automated braking, self-parking, lane-departure warning, and variable-speed cruise control. Most are racing to develop fully autonomous vehicles \xe2\x80\x94 as are technology firms like Google and Uber \xe2\x80\x94 and nearly half a dozen states have passed laws allowing testing of driverless vehicles on public roads. (Current regulations require a human operator behind the wheel of an autonomous test vehicle, but these regulations are likely to change as the technology advances.)\n\nSelf-driving cars will have a number of social and economic effects. In addition to freeing drivers to engage in tasks other than driving, autonomous vehicles promise to reduce traffic collisions by removing humans, and thus human error and negligence, from behind the wheel. By allowing closer platooning and lowering the number of collisions, self-driving vehicles will also increase effective road capacity, particularly on highways.\n\nSince the initially steep upfront costs of driverless vehicles can be offset by lower labor costs, the freight, transit, and taxi industries could be early adopters of driverless technologies, affecting the country\'s 4.5 million bus, taxi, and truck drivers \xe2\x80\x94 mostly men with high school degrees or less, a demographic that has not fared well in the recent recession or the larger digital revolution.\n\nSelf-driving cars also could have profound, though highly uncertain, impacts on sustainability and urban form, two areas of particular interest to city and regional planners.\n\nTwo scenarios\n\nWhether self-driving cars reduce harmful emissions or the amount of land, energy, money, and other resources consumed by the transportation system depends largely on whether they reduce car ownership and driving. Optimists envision a future where driverless cars lead to a revolution in shared urban mobility. Why own a car when you can summon one to pick you up while avoiding the worries of parking, insurance, or maintenance?\n\nIn this scenario, the shift in ownership will also encourage payment based on miles driven and time of day rather than lumpy vehicle purchases, insurance fees, and parking. Instead of thinking about how much gas is in the tank, travelers will now consider the full marginal cost of a car trip when deciding whether to walk, bike, drive, or take transit. Transit service may also improve as a result of shared cars and minivans operating on fixed and flexible routes.\n\nThe biggest opportunity for improvement is in cities and neighborhoods where densities are currently too low to justify frequent bus or rail service. If shared or public, self-driving cars will dramatically reduce the demand for parking. Even privately owned vehicles will drop off passengers at front doors before driving off-site or behind a building to park, thus decoupling parking from other urban land uses. This would allow cities to dedicate more space to housing, shops, and offices, as well as stormwater management, street trees, and other sustainable features.\n\nPessimists, by contrast, see vehicle automation as one more technology that makes driving more comfortable and convenient and thus increases the amount that people drive. In this scenario, most households will own one or more self-driving cars, send their vehicles to run errands, circle to avoid paying for parking, and treat travel as if it had zero or very low time costs.\n\nMany cars may become full-time mobile offices, whisking people between meetings, and the number of workers commuting between metropolitan regions will almost certainly increase. Making long commutes more productive will support the growing trend in long-duration commutes. Between 1990 and 2010, the proportion of commuters traveling more than 60 minutes and more than 90 minutes to work increased from six to eight percent and 1.6 to 2.5 percent, respectively.\n\nSelf-driving cars will also expand personal mobility for the third of the population without drivers\' licenses and the tenth of households without cars due to age, disability, low income, or preference. A demonstration video of one of Google\'s prototype self-driving cars features a legally blind man riding to a Taco Bell in a self-driving vehicle.\n\nExpanded access to cars may be particularly important for the nation\'s elderly, many of whom live in and would like to remain in car-dependent communities. In this scenario, even if self-driving cars double existing capacity, this capacity will fill quickly \xe2\x80\x94 encouraging dispersed development and greater land consumption, which would further erode any sustainability benefits from increased efficiency.\n\nGlass half full or half empty?\n\nWhose view is more realistic \xe2\x80\x94 the optimists\' or the pessimists\'? Both may be partially correct. Net effects will vary across states, cities, and neighborhoods. In dense urban areas with good transit where the demand for space and shared mobility is higher, driverless cars will tend to increase density and improve transit. In sprawling areas, self-driving cars will encourage more sprawl by making it easier to live farther from employment centers and other destinations. Urban cores will likely concentrate while peripheral areas expand. Suburban areas will probably continue to rely on privately owned vehicles but could see improvements in transit and shared mobility.\n\nWhat can planners do to prepare for driverless vehicles? The new technology could produce rapid and radical changes to metropolitan transportation systems, particularly freight and transit. However, the timing, scale, and direction of the impacts are uncertain and the opportunities to influence outcomes are limited. For better or worse, major changes to passenger travel might be slow to materialize \xe2\x80\x94 the technology remains expensive and the vehicle fleet turns over slowly (the average passenger car is just over 11 years old). Some 15 years after the commercial release of the Toyota Prius, hybrid vehicles make up only a tiny share of the U.S. car fleet.\n\nRegardless, planners should pay close attention to the technology, start thinking about which regulations (particularly on-site parking requirements) could change quickly in response to new technologies, and perhaps redirect capital investments away from infrastructure-heavy projects with a long lifespan to shorter term, more flexible projects that are insulated from some of the uncertainty around the timing and impacts of self-driving cars.\n\nErick Guerra is an assistant professor of city and regional planning at the University of Pennsylvania, where his research focuses on the relationships between transportation infrastructure, land use, urban development, and travel behavior.\n\nWeb-Only Expanded Sidebar\n\nRead ""Attention: The Age of Automation Is Right Ahead,"" an expanded version of the article that appeared in the printed magazine.\n\nResources\n\nImage: This early prototype of Google\'s self-driving car was designed to go from point A to point B without human intervention.

"144.txt";"b'The California Department of Motor Vehicles said this week it\xe2\x80\x99s reviewing whether Tesla is telling people that its cars are self-driving when, legally speaking, they\xe2\x80\x99re not. This follows fatal crashes that may have involved its Autopilot feature. Tesla advertises a \xe2\x80\x9cFull Self-Driving\xe2\x80\x9d upgrade option. One man has been busted in Teslas more than once for reckless driving. He hangs out in the backseat and steers with his feet.\n\nMeanwhile, no cars are fully self-driving yet. I spoke with Missy Cummings, the director of the Humans and Autonomy Laboratory at Duke University. She says the so-called deep learning that cars need to see the road around them doesn\xe2\x80\x99t actually learn. The following is an edited transcript of our conversation.\n\nMissy Cummings (Photo courtesy Duke University)\n\nMissy Cummings: I can show a convolutional neural net a million images of a stop sign, and it will learn what a stop sign is from those images. But if it sees a stop sign that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t match exactly those images, then it can\xe2\x80\x99t recognize it. And this is a huge problem, because if a strand of kudzu leaves starts to grow across just the top 20% of a stop sign, that is enough to make that algorithm be dumb, and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t recognize it, because it\xe2\x80\x99s never seen a stop sign with one strand of kudzu leaves across it.\n\nMolly Wood: Is there an awareness of this, do you think? Is everybody sort of still trying to push the same solution when it comes to self-driving cars? Are people starting to realize these limitations and internalize them and change their approach at all?\n\nCummings: I think there are three camps of people not just in self-driving, but in robotics and artificial intelligence in general. There\xe2\x80\x99s the camp of people like me who know the reality. We recognize it for what it is, we\xe2\x80\x99ve recognized it for some time, and we know that unless we change fundamentally the way that we\xe2\x80\x99re approaching this problem, it is not solvable with our current approach. There\xe2\x80\x99s another larger group of people who recognize that there are some problems but feel like with enough money and enough time, we can solve it. And then there\xe2\x80\x99s a third group of people that no matter what you tell them, they believe that we can solve this problem. And you can\xe2\x80\x99t talk them off that platform.\n\nChange the approach to the problem\n\nThe people who are the biggest problem are the people in that second group, the ones that believe that with enough time and money, we can fix it, instead of recognizing the elephant in the room for what it is, which is not fixable under our current approach. And this is why you see companies like Starsky, a trucking company that went out of business, and you starting to see all the mergers across the automotive industry where all companies are either teaming up with each other or with software companies, because they realize that they just cannot keep hemorrhaging money the way they are. But that pit still has no bottom. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t see this becoming a viable commercial set of operations in terms of self-driving cars for anyone anywhere, ever, until we address this problem.\n\nWood: What about the tests that seem to be going fine, like Waymo testing fully operating taxis in Phoenix with no support drivers and not having crashes?\n\nCummings: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s interesting to me that that\xe2\x80\x99s your perception, because that\xe2\x80\x99s the perception that Waymo wants you to have. But the reality is behind every self-driving car in Phoenix, there are a team of humans that are remotely monitoring and potentially intervening when the systems go down. And there was recently a video that went viral on YouTube, where a Waymo car in its fully self-driving mode got stuck by a single orange cone. And eventually, they had to send a team of people to put a human in the car and drive the poor passenger out of the conundrum that he was in. And this is very recent. And you have to ask yourself, if we are having a car that supposedly is fully self-driving, so there\xe2\x80\x99s no driver, but we have to have a team of four to six people managing that one car for problems. First of all, that\xe2\x80\x99s not scalable.\n\nIntervention needed\n\nAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s not really self-driving if there has to be so much intervention. And if that\xe2\x80\x99s where we are in technology today, how are we going to make a business out of this? And John Krafcik, the former CEO of Waymo, I mean, he recently left. I feel like John, in that way, was basically admitting what I have been trying to tell people all these years, is that we just can\xe2\x80\x99t solve this problem in the way that you think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to. We need to completely clean sheet this and start over.\n\nWood: So when we see Uber and Lyft, for example, essentially exiting this self-driving car business, do you think it is a sign of companies who have sort of said \xe2\x80\x9cthis is just a money pit\xe2\x80\x9d?\n\nCummings: Yes, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly right.\n\nWood: On the other hand, we have Tesla, which is not doing any of that. What are we to make of that?\n\nCummings: Well, I think the Tesla situation is a little different. Should they be allowed to call their driving assist technology Full Self-Driving? So that\xe2\x80\x99s one problem. And then, if you want to ask, is Tesla ever going to have a robotaxi program? I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you, that answer is no. But that problem is less acute for Tesla, because they have what is otherwise a great product. I love Tesla cars. I just think Autopilot and especially Full Self-Driving are both overhyped, and they underdeliver in terms of performance, and they\xe2\x80\x99re dangerous.\n\nWood: So there\xe2\x80\x99s a math problem and there is a pretty significant marketing problem?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe religion of Tesla\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nCummings: That\xe2\x80\x99s right. So I think that we\xe2\x80\x99re starting to see increasing numbers of crashes in this country and abroad, where drivers think that their car is far more capable. I think what is interesting to me was how the Tesla driver who got arrested for being in his backseat while he was driving vocalized that he\xe2\x80\x99d already been warned once, and he defied the warning and did it again, and then said he would keep doing it because he knows Elon [Musk] knows what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing. And he fully believes in Tesla.\n\nAnd so what I find most interesting about that statement is that one man is vocalizing what so many people believe. They believe that this technology really can be fully self-driving, despite all the warnings and despite all the statements and the owner\xe2\x80\x99s manual, and you having to agree that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to pay attention. Despite all of those warnings, there\xe2\x80\x99s some belief likely based in calling a technology Full Self-Driving and calling it Autopilot where people believe in the religion of Tesla full self-driving, and that is dangerous.\n\nRelated links: More insight from Molly Wood\n\nTesla\xe2\x80\x99s website does call the upgrade option Full Self-Driving, but also says the cars can\xe2\x80\x99t drive themselves. Back in March, a Tesla engineer told the DMV that despite Elon Musk\xe2\x80\x99s claims that the company would have a fully self-driving car by the end of this year, that claim did not match the engineering reality. For a refresher, there are five agreed-upon levels of autonomous driving, where No. 1 is you driving your car with your hands and feet, and No. 5 is the car doing everything while you sleep in the back seat in a way that does not endanger you or everyone around you. The Tesla engineer told the DMV, according to a memo produced by the agency, that Tesla is currently at level 2 \xe2\x80\x94 some self-driving functionality, but requiring a human with hands on the wheel at all times.\n\nHere is a column about deep learning and why that author also thinks the tech is too limited to be able to adapt to real-world conditions, because the algorithms would have to pre-learn every single possible thing that could happen on the road \xe2\x80\x94 from a kudzu stop sign to a spaceship landing on the freeway. There\xe2\x80\x99s also a little more reading and listening on Uber and Lyft getting out of the self-driving game. Marketplace\xe2\x80\x99s Meghan McCarty Carino covered that on the \xe2\x80\x9cMarketplace Morning Report.\n\n\n\nApple might still be working on this \xe2\x80\x94 maybe? It got a patent in March for a night-vision tech system to let its self-driving cars see in the dark. Earlier this week, MacReports noted that Apple has increased the number of self-driving cars it\xe2\x80\x99s registered with the DMV from 66 to 68, but dramatically decreased the number of people licensed to operate those cars. And it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t applied for a driverless testing permit. Apple has been flirting off and on with self-driving cars for a few years now. First it laid off almost everyone involved with its so-called Project Titan, and then it bought a self-driving car startup that was almost defunct. So I guess that puts them in the second category of technologists that Missy Cummings described. We\xe2\x80\x99ll call them the self-driving Dorys \xe2\x80\x94 you know, the fish that just keeps swimming.'";"Autonomous Cars";"144.txt-Autonomous Cars"
"145.txt";"b'What is an autonomous vehicle?\n\nThere is a lot of information out there regarding autonomous vehicles. You may have even read several different names or references (autonomous vehicle, automated vehicle, self-driving vehicle, unmanned vehicle, highly automated vehicles, the list goes on!)\n\nWhile some production vehicles on the road today available to consumers introduce some form of automation, commonly reference to as advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), (adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, lane departure assistance, and others), these are not autonomous vehicles. An engaged and fully present driver is required to perform all aspects of the driving task. These technologies do offer tremendous safety promise, as they can prevent or lessen the severity of a crash. CDOT is evaluating how roadway design (striping, pavement markings, and signs) can improve the performance of these driver assistance technologies.\n\nThere are manufacturers and other companies that are interested in testing, deploying and researching vehicles that change the basic architecture of the vehicle or remove the human driver.

Those declarations were accompanied by announcements from General Motors, Google\xe2\x80\x99s Waymo, Toyota, and Honda that they\xe2\x80\x99d be making self-driving cars by 2020. Elon Musk forecast that Tesla would do it by 2018 \xe2\x80\x94 and then, when that failed, by 2020.\n\nBut the year is here \xe2\x80\x94 and the self-driving cars aren\xe2\x80\x99t.\n\nDespite extraordinary efforts from many of the leading names in tech and in automaking, fully autonomous cars are still out of reach except in special trial programs. You can buy a car that will automatically brake for you when it anticipates a collision, or one that helps keep you in your lane, or even a Tesla Model S (which \xe2\x80\x94 disclosure \xe2\x80\x94 my partner and I own) whose Autopilot mostly handles highway driving.\n\nBut almost every one of the above predictions has been rolled back as the engineering teams at those companies struggle to make self-driving cars work properly.\n\nWhat happened? Here are nine questions you might have had about this long-promised technology, and why the future we were promised still hasn\xe2\x80\x99t arrived.\n\n1) How exactly do self-driving cars work?\n\nEngineers have been attempting prototypes of self-driving cars for decades. The idea behind it is really simple: Outfit a car with cameras that can track all the objects around it and have the car react if it\xe2\x80\x99s about to steer into one. Teach in-car computers the rules of the road and set them loose to navigate to their own destination.\n\nThis simple description elides a whole lot of complexity. Driving is one of the more complicated activities humans routinely do. Following a list of rules of the road isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough to drive as well as a human does, because we do things like make eye contact with others to confirm who has the right of way, react to weather conditions, and otherwise make judgment calls that are difficult to encode in hard-and-fast rules.\n\nAnd even the simple parts of driving \xe2\x80\x94 like tracking the objects around a car on the road \xe2\x80\x94 are actually much trickier than they sound. Take Google\xe2\x80\x99s sister company Waymo, the industry leader in self-driving cars. Waymo\xe2\x80\x99s cars, which are fairly typical of other self-driving cars, use high-resolution cameras and lidar (light detection and ranging), a way of estimating distances to objects by bouncing light and sound off things.\n\nThe car\xe2\x80\x99s computers combine all of this to build a picture of where other cars, cyclists, pedestrians, and obstacles are and where they\xe2\x80\x99re moving. For this part, lots of training data is needed \xe2\x80\x94 that is, the car has to draw on millions of miles of driving data that Waymo has collected to form expectations about how other objects might move. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to get enough training data on the road, so the cars also train based on simulation data \xe2\x80\x94 but engineers have to be sure that their AI systems will generalize correctly from the simulation data to the real world.\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s far from a complete description of the systems at work when a self-driving car is on the road. But it illustrates an important principle to keep in mind when wondering where our self-driving cars are: Even the \xe2\x80\x9ceasy\xe2\x80\x9d things turn out to hide surprising complexity.\n\n2) Why is it taking longer than expected to get self-driving cars on the road?\n\nSelf-driving cars rely on artificial intelligence to work. And the 2010s were a great decade for AI. We saw big advances in translation, speech generation, computer vision and object recognition, and game-playing. AI used to have a hard time identifying dogs in pictures; now that\xe2\x80\x99s a trivial task.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s this progress in AI that drove the optimistic predictions for self-driving cars in the mid-2010s. Researchers anticipated that we could build on the amazing gains they\xe2\x80\x99d seen (and are still seeing) in other arenas.\n\nBut when it came to self-driving cars, the limitations of those gains became very apparent. Even with extraordinary amounts of time, money, and effort invested, no team could figure out how to have AI solve a real-world problem: navigating our roads with the high degree of reliability needed.\n\nMuch of the problem is the need for lots of training data. The ideal way to train a self-driving car would be to show it billions of hours of footage of real driving, and use that to teach the computer good driving behavior. Modern machine learning systems do really well when they have abundant data, and very poorly when they have only a little bit of it. But collecting data for self-driving cars is expensive. And since some events are rare \xe2\x80\x94 witnessing a car accident ahead, say, or encountering debris on the road \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s possible for the car to be out of its depth because it has encountered a situation so infrequently in its training data.\n\nCarmakers have tried to get around this in lots of ways. They\xe2\x80\x99ve driven more miles. They\xe2\x80\x99ve trained the cars in simulations. They sometimes engineer specific situations so that they can get more training data about those situations for the cars.\n\nAnd they are getting closer. Waymo cars do roam the streets of Arizona with no one behind the wheel (a small pool of specially screened people can call them up like they would an Uber). If all goes well, they may expand to more cities later this year (more on this below). But it\xe2\x80\x99s a hard problem, and progress has been slow.\n\n3) What does a world with self-driving cars look like?\n\nCompanies continue to invest despite the setbacks because self-driving cars, when they happen, will change a lot for the world \xe2\x80\x94 and make their creators lots of money.\n\nMany consumers will want to upgrade. Imagine being able to read or doze off during your morning drive to work or on long car trips. It also seems likely that taxi and ride-hailing companies will offer self-driving cars, rather than paying drivers (in fact, companies like Uber are betting on it). Self-driving cars should also make a huge difference for Americans with disabilities, many of whom can\xe2\x80\x99t get a driver\xe2\x80\x99s license and have trouble getting to work, the store, and doctor\xe2\x80\x99s appointments.\n\nExperts disagree on whether self-driving cars will change anything fundamental about car ownership in America. Some argue that people won\xe2\x80\x99t need to own a car if they can order one on their phone and get a timely robot ride anywhere.\n\nOthers have pointed out that people generally still own a car even in areas with good ride-share coverage and that self-driving cars might not be any different. Polls suggest that most Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be driven to work by a self-driving car \xe2\x80\x94 but that might change fast once such cars actually exist. Gallup polling on this question found a small share (9 percent) of Americans who\xe2\x80\x99d get such a car right away, with a larger contingent (38 percent) saying they\xe2\x80\x99d wait a while, and half holding steadfast that they\xe2\x80\x99d never use one.\n\nOver time, our infrastructure will likely change to make it easier for self-driving cars to navigate, and in fact, some researchers have argued that we won\xe2\x80\x99t have widespread self-driving cars until we\xe2\x80\x99ve made major changes to our streets to make it easier to communicate information to those cars. That would be expensive and require nationwide coordination, so it seems likely that it would follow the widespread introduction of self-driving cars rather than precede it.\n\n4) What are the leading self-driving car programs, and what are they doing?\n\nAlmost every major car manufacturer has at least tested the waters with self-driving car research. But some are much more serious about it than others.\n\nThere are two core statistics useful for evaluating how advanced a self-driving car program is. One is how many miles it has driven. That\xe2\x80\x99s a proxy for how much training data the company has, and how much investment it has poured into getting its cars on the road.\n\nThe other is disengagements \xe2\x80\x94 moments when a human driver has to take over because the computer couldn\xe2\x80\x99t handle a situation \xe2\x80\x94 per mile driven. Most companies don\xe2\x80\x99t share these statistics, but the state of California requires that they be reported, and so California\xe2\x80\x99s statistics are the best peek into how various companies are doing.\n\nOn both fronts, Google\xe2\x80\x99s sister company Waymo is the clear leader. Waymo just announced 20 million miles driven overall, most of those not in California. In 2018, Waymo drove 1.2 million miles in California, with 0.09 disengagements every 1,000 miles. Coming in second is General Motors\xe2\x80\x99 Cruise, with about half a million miles and 0.19 disengagements per 1,000 miles. (Cruise argues that since it tests its cars on San Francisco\xe2\x80\x99s difficult streets, these numbers are even more impressive than they look.)\n\nThose two companies are well ahead of everyone else in both miles driven and disengagements in the state of California. While that\xe2\x80\x99s only a limited snapshot of their efforts, most experts consider them the leading programs in general.\n\n5) Didn\xe2\x80\x99t a self-driving car kill a woman? How did that happen? And what are the safety issues involved with self-driving cars?\n\nMarch 18, 2018, was the first time a self-driving car ran down a pedestrian. An Uber car with a safety driver behind the wheel hit and killed Elaine Herzberg, a 49-year-old woman walking her bicycle across the street in Tempe, Arizona.\n\nThe incident was a reminder that self-driving car technology still had a long way to go. Some people were quick to point out that humans frequently kill other humans while driving, and that even if self-driving cars are much safer than humans, there will be some fatal incidents with self-driving cars. That\xe2\x80\x99s true as far as it goes. But it misses a key point. Human driving produces one fatal accident in every 100 million miles driven. Waymo, the leader in miles driven, just reached 20 million miles driven. It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had a fatal accident yet, but given the number of miles its cars have driven, it\xe2\x80\x99s simply far too soon to prove that they\xe2\x80\x99re as safe as or safer than a human driver.\n\nUber hasn\xe2\x80\x99t driven nearly as many miles and has had a fatal incident. The company doesn\xe2\x80\x99t release specific figures, but its filings for its IPO last year said that it had driven \xe2\x80\x9cmillions\xe2\x80\x9d of miles. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to tell without specific numbers, but it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to wonder if Uber\xe2\x80\x99s driving record is much worse than a human\xe2\x80\x99s.\n\nFurthermore, a review of Herzberg\xe2\x80\x99s death suggests that a lot of preventable mistakes were made. The accident report by the National Transportation Safety Board, released in December 2019, found that the near-range cameras and the ultrasonic sensors \xe2\x80\x9cwere not in use at the time of the crash.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAdditionally, the system was having such a problem with false alarms \xe2\x80\x94 detecting dangerous situations when none existed \xe2\x80\x94 that it had been programmed with \xe2\x80\x9ca one-second period during which the ADS [automated driving system] suppresses planned braking while the (1) system verifies the nature of the detected hazard and calculates an alternative path, or (2) vehicle operator takes control of the vehicle,\xe2\x80\x9d according to the NTSB report. So even when the car detected the hazard, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t brake \xe2\x80\x94 which could have made the collision avoidable or much less deadly \xe2\x80\x94 but instead continued with exactly what it was doing for a full second.\n\nThe system was designed to assume that pedestrians would never cross except at a crosswalk, so when one did cross without using one, it failed to identify her. Even worse, when the system was unclear on whether an object was a bicycle (as it was with Herzberg), it was unable to retain any information about how the object was moving. The system sensed her presence six full seconds before the impact \xe2\x80\x94 and yet did nothing (except possibly braking in the last two-tenths of a second) before colliding with her at deadly speed.\n\nThose are avoidable failures.\n\nUber pulled its cars off the road in response, returning to self-driving car trials a year later with a drastically changed program. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve implemented key safety improvements from both safety reviews, shared our learnings with the larger self-driving industry, and accepted the NTSB\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation to implement a Safety Management System, which is underway today,\xe2\x80\x9d Nat Beuse, Uber\xe2\x80\x99s self-driving cars head of safety, told Vox in a statement in response to a request for comment. \xe2\x80\x9cAs we look ahead to the future, we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to keep safety at the center of every decision we make.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNonetheless, deadly accidents with self-driving cars will keep happening \xe2\x80\x94 and it\xe2\x80\x99s not just Uber. A report from the National Transportation Safety Board implicated Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s Autopilot system in another lethal 2018 accident; while the driver had his hands off the wheel, the car steered into a concrete divider and crashed, killing him. A full investigation hasn\xe2\x80\x99t yet been conducted on three more recent deadly Tesla crashes. The problem, according to NTSB chairman Robert Sumwalt, is that drivers assume Autopilot lets them take their attention off the road, when they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. That won\xe2\x80\x99t be a problem with fully autonomous vehicles, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a potentially major one now.\n\nAs I\xe2\x80\x99ve written before, getting good self-driving cars on the road can save hundreds of thousands of lives. But it takes a lot of engineering work to get the cars good enough to be lifesaving.\n\n6) Are self-driving cars going to be good for the environment?\n\nSome advocates have argued that self-driving cars will be good for the environment. They claim they might reduce car trips by making car ownership unnecessary and transitioning society to a model where most people don\xe2\x80\x99t own a car and just call for one when they need one.\n\nIn addition, others have argued that human drivers drive in a wasteful way \xe2\x80\x94 braking hard, accelerating hard, idling the engine, all of which use up fuel \xe2\x80\x94 which a computer could avoid.\n\nBut as self-driving cars have inched closer to reality, most of these claimed benefits have started to look less likely.\n\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s not much evidence that computers are dramatically more fuel-efficient drivers than humans. There\xe2\x80\x99s one small study suggesting adaptive cruise control improves efficiency a little (5 to 7 percent), but there\xe2\x80\x99s little else beyond that. Furthermore, researchers have examined the effects of more fuel-efficient cars on miles traveled and found that, under many circumstances, people drive more when cars get more fuel-efficient \xe2\x80\x94 so self-driving cars having higher fuel efficiency might not mean that they produce lower emissions.\n\nOne study attempting to estimate the effects of self-driving cars on car use behavior simulated a family having a self-driving car by paying for them to have a chauffeur for a week, and telling them to treat the chauffeur service the way they\xe2\x80\x99d treat having a car that could drive itself.\n\nThe result? They went on a lot more car trips.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s still possible that some big transition to a lower-driving world will happen. A study of one week of driving habits isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough to settle the question for sure. The researchers who conducted that study are preparing future studies, and it\xe2\x80\x99s possible those comparisons will turn up more encouraging results.\n\n7) So if they\xe2\x80\x99re not necessarily safer and they\xe2\x80\x99re not necessarily greener, why are we even doing this?\n\nThe above few sections might inspire some pessimism, but there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of reason to be excited about self-driving cars. They will likely make life easier for older people and those with disabilities who cannot safely drive. They might provide better, safer, and cheaper options for people currently forced to own a car to get anywhere. Additional research and development will make them safer \xe2\x80\x94 and once the kinks are worked out, there is a likelihood that self-driving cars will be safer than human-driven ones.\n\nIn a sense, we\xe2\x80\x99re in an awkward transition moment where we want self-driving cars they aren\xe2\x80\x99t yet an uncomplicated positive.\n\nResearch and development is proceeding anyway, mostly because self-driving cars will probably be a gold mine for the first company to get them on the road. They\xe2\x80\x99ll likely be able to establish themselves in ride-hailing, taxi, and trucking markets while competitors are still struggling to catch up, and then they\xe2\x80\x99ll benefit from the additional miles traveled to further improve their cars.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not uncommon for a technology to be dangerous and barely worth it when it is first invented, only to eventually be refined into a valuable part of modern life. The first airplanes were dangerous and commercially useless, but we improved things dramatically from there.\n\n8) What role does policy play in the development of self-driving cars?\n\nThere is no federal law regarding self-driving cars. Much of the action on policy has largely taken place at the state level. And the laws surrounding self-driving cars vary enormously by state, with 29 states having passed legislation.\n\nSelf-driving car development mostly happens in the states that have been friendliest to it \xe2\x80\x94 especially California and Arizona \xe2\x80\x94 and it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to envision some states banning self-driving cars long after they become commonplace in other states, especially if the safety case for them isn\xe2\x80\x99t a slam-dunk.\n\nWhen self-driving cars were first proposed, I heard a lot of worries that regulators would unnecessarily delay their implementation. By 2016, it was obvious that hadn\xe2\x80\x99t come to pass. Indeed, in some cases regulators may have been too permissive \xe2\x80\x94 for example, in light of Uber pulling its cars and instituting new safety procedures, it seems the vehicle that killed Elaine Herzberg probably shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been on the road at all.\n\nPolicy might also shape whether self-driving cars are good or bad for the environment. With high taxes on gasoline, for example, the social costs of carbon emissions could be reflected in the price of using self-driving cars \xe2\x80\x94 and the money can be spent on climate adaptation and clean energy. But right now, our transportation policy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do much of anything about the social costs of driving, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a problem that will only get worse if self-driving cars put more people on the road.\n\n9) So just when are we getting self-driving cars?\n\nIn some senses, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been \xe2\x80\x9cclose\xe2\x80\x9d on self-driving cars for years now. Waymo is doing test runs with no one behind the wheel in Arizona, which it\xe2\x80\x99s been doing since 2017. Cruise delayed the 2019 launch of its autonomous taxi service but thinks it might happen in 2020. Earlier this year, the company unveiled a car with no steering wheel ... and no timetable for when it\xe2\x80\x99ll be available for sale. Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s periodic software updates make its Autopilot highway self-driving work better, but it remains well short of full self-driving.\n\nThere are certainly skeptics. Recently, the CEO of Volkswagen said that fully self-driving cars might \xe2\x80\x9cnever happen.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThat might be an overly harsh forecast, considering the progress that\xe2\x80\x99s been made. But it is exasperatingly difficult to get a good estimate of how long until self-driving cars happen for real for the typical American, both because no one knows for sure and because companies have incentives to publicize optimistic estimates. The companies boast about their progress but don\xe2\x80\x99t publish their mishaps. Timelines slip, and the change in plans is often publicly acknowledged only long after it\xe2\x80\x99s become obvious that the deadline can\xe2\x80\x99t be met.\n\nAt the same time, companies hesitate to put their cars on the road when there\xe2\x80\x99s any chance they aren\xe2\x80\x99t ready. They are well aware that killing someone, as Uber did, is not only horrible but also probably spells doom for their business. So there\xe2\x80\x99s ample incentive to say optimistic things and not actually launch.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not hard to imagine their arrival later this year, at least in sufficiently limited contexts; it\xe2\x80\x99s also not hard to imagine that the deadlines will be pushed out another three or four years.\n\nSelf-driving cars are on their way. They\xe2\x80\x99re closer than they were a year ago. When they\xe2\x80\x99ll actually get here is anyone\xe2\x80\x99s guess.\n\nSign up for the Future Perfect newsletter and we\xe2\x80\x99ll send you a roundup of ideas and solutions for tackling the world\xe2\x80\x99s biggest challenges \xe2\x80\x94 and how to get better at doing good.\n\nvox-mark Sign up for the newsletter Future Perfect Each week, we explore unique solutions to some of the world's biggest problems.

See detailed requirements.\n\nComputer Vision In this course, you will develop critical Machine Learning skills that are commonly leveraged in autonomous vehicle engineering. You will learn about the life cycle of a Machine Learning project, from framing the problem and choosing metrics to training and improving models. This course will focus on the camera sensor and you will learn how to process raw digital images before feeding them into different algorithms, such as neural networks. You will build convolutional neural networks using TensorFlow and learn how to classify and detect objects in images. With this course, you will be exposed to the whole Machine Learning workflow and get a good understanding of the work of a Machine Learning Engineer and how it translates to the autonomous vehicle context. Object Detection in an Urban Environment\n\nSensor Fusion In this course, you will learn about a key enabler for self-driving cars: sensor fusion. Besides cameras, self-driving cars rely on other sensors with complementary measurement principles to improve robustness and reliability. Therefore, you will learn about the lidar sensor and its role in the autonomous vehicle sensor suite. You will learn about the lidar working principle, get an overview of currently available lidar types and their differences, and look at relevant criteria for sensor selection. Also, you will learn how to detect objects such as vehicles in a 3D lidar point cloud using a deep-learning approach and then evaluate detection performance using a set of state-of-the-art metrics. In the second half of the course, you will learn how to fuse camera and lidar detections and track objects over time with an Extended Kalman Filter. You will get hands-on experience with multi-target tracking, where you will learn how to initialize, update and delete tracks, assign measurements to tracks with data association techniques and manage several tracks simultaneously. After completing the course, you will have a solid foundation to work as a sensor fusion engineer on self-driving cars. 3D Object Detection Sensor Fusion\n\nLocalization In this course, you will learn all about robotic localization, from one-dimensional motion models up to using three-dimensional point cloud maps obtained from lidar sensors. You\xe2\x80\x99ll begin by learning about the bicycle motion model, an approach to use simple motion to estimate location at the next time step, before gathering sensor data. Then, you\xe2\x80\x99ll move onto using Markov localization in order to do 1D object tracking, as well as further leveraging motion models. From there, you will learn how to implement two scan matching algorithms, Iterative Closest Point (ICP) and Normal Distributions Transform (NDP), which work with 2D and 3D data. Finally, you will utilize these scan matching algorithms in the Point Cloud Library (PCL) to localize a simulated car with lidar sensing, using a 3D point cloud map obtained from the CARLA simulator. Scan Matching Localization\n\nPlanning Path planning routes a vehicle from one point to another, and it handles how to react when emergencies arise. The Mercedes-Benz Vehicle Intelligence team will take you through the three stages of path planning. First, you\xe2\x80\x99ll apply model-driven and data-driven approaches to predict how other vehicles on the road will behave. Then you\xe2\x80\x99ll construct a finite state machine to decide which of several maneuvers your own vehicle should undertake. Finally, you\xe2\x80\x99ll generate a safe and comfortable trajectory to execute that maneuver.

"155.txt";"b'Sensor Integration\n\nComponents like radar, LiDAR and cameras are used to provide the distance to objects that surround the vehicle. If the exact location of the surrounding objects is known, this technology can provide the absolute vehicle location with assistance from a high amount of map data. When integrated with complimentary technology such as: ultrasonic, inertial motion, digital maps, radar/LiDAR and cameras, GNSS acts as the sixth sense to deliver the positioning performance required by autonomous vehicles.\n\nMany technologies onboard vehicles provide local or relative localization. GNSS provides an absolute localization solution, and with the following technologies can achieve the accuracy and availability requirements of a full autonomous driving solution.\n\nSPAN\xc2\xae GNSS+INS Navigation\n\nWith the growing developments in automotive technology, the need for accurate, reliable and robust ground reference has emerged.

"156.txt";"b'An autonomous vehicle, or a driverless vehicle, is one that is able to operate itself and perform necessary functions without any human intervention, through ability to sense its surroundings.\n\nAn autonomous vehicle utilises a fully automated driving system in order to allow the vehicle to respond to external conditions that a human driver would manage.\n\nWhat are the 6 Levels of Autonomous Vehicles?\n\nThere are six different levels of automation and, as the levels increase, the extent of the driverless car\xe2\x80\x99s independence regarding operation control increases.\n\nAt level 0, the car has no control over its operation and the human driver does all of the driving.\n\nAt level 1, the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s ADAS (advanced driver assistance system) has the ability to support the driver with either steering or accelerating and braking.\n\nAt level 2, the ADAS can oversee steering and accelerating and braking in some conditions, although the human driver is required to continue paying complete attention to the driving environment throughout the journey, while also performing the remainder of the necessary tasks.\n\nAt level 3, the ADS (advanced driving system) can perform all parts of the driving task in some conditions, but the human driver is required to be able to regain control when requested to do so by the ADS. In the remaining conditions, the human driver executes the necessary tasks.\n\nAt level 4, the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s ADS is able to perform all driving tasks independently in certain conditions in which human attention is not required.\n\nFinally, level 5 involves full automation whereby the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s ADS is able to perform all tasks in all conditions, and no driving assistance is required from the human driver. This full automation will be enabled by the application of 5G technology, which will allow vehicles to communicate not just with one another, but also with traffic lights, signage and even the roads themselves.\n\nOne of the aspects of the vehicle technology used in automated vehicles is ACC, or adaptive cruise control. This system is able to adjust the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s speed automatically to ensure that it maintains a safe distance from the vehicles in front of it. This function relies on information obtained using sensors on the vehicle and allows the car to perform tasks such as brake when it senses that it is approaching any vehicles ahead. This information is then processed and the appropriate instructions are sent to actuators in the vehicle, which control the responsive actions of the car such as steering, acceleration and braking. Highly automated vehicles with fully automated speed control are able to respond to signals from traffic lights and other such non-vehicular activities.\n\nWhat are the Advantages?\n\nAutonomous vehicle technology may be able to provide certain advantages compared to human-driven vehicles. One such potential advantage is that they could provide increased safety on the road \xe2\x80\x93 vehicle crashes cause many deaths every year, and automated vehicles could potentially decrease the number of casualties as the software used in them is likely to make fewer errors in comparison to humans. A decrease in the number of accidents could also reduce traffic congestion, which is a further potential advantage posed by autonomous vehicles. Autonomous driving can also achieve this by the removal of human behaviours that cause blockages on the road, specifically stop-and-go traffic.\n\nAnother possible advantage of automated driving is that people who are not able to drive \xe2\x80\x93 due to factors like age and disabilities \xe2\x80\x93 could be able to use automated cars as more convenient transport systems.\n\nAdditional advantages that come with an autonomous car are elimination of driving fatigue and being able to sleep during overnight journeys.'";"Autonomous Cars";"156.txt-Autonomous Cars"

Further to this, what will actually be transported in self-driving vehicles is another interesting question. With a steep expansion in ecommerce, the flow of goods in cities is suited to smaller vehicles.

Therefore self-driving cars, to some extent, may replace trucks in order to improve parcel delivery for transport companies with a need for micro logistics around a city.\n\nIn the 2014 Ericsson ConsumerLab report, Connectivity Beyond the Screen, 67 percent of smartphone owners said they were interested in a same-day delivery service that works on any device, online and in stores.

Hyundai executives were said to be divided over the prospect of a deal with Apple, though Apple planned to invest 4 trillion won ($3.6 billion) in Kia Motors, with Kia set to manufacture the Apple Car in its U.S. facility located in Georgia.\n\nApple reportedly considered Hyundai-Kia because the deal would give Apple access to an established automaker with the capability to produce vehicles in North America. Hyundai-Kia was also willing to give Apple control over both the Apple Car software and the hardware, with Apple planning for a full Apple-branded vehicle and not a Kia model that included Apple software.\n\nDespite all the rumors of an Apple/Hyundai-Kia partnership, Apple paused the talks and has also been discussing Apple Car plans with other automobile manufacturers. According to Bloomberg, Apple was upset that Hyundai confirmed that it was in talks with Apple even though Hyundai eventually retracted and revised the statement.\n\nHyundai and its Kia affiliate confirmed in February 2021 that they are not in discussions with Apple to cooperate on the development of a self-driving electric vehicle, so it appears the discussions between Apple and the two car manufacturing companies may have been tabled for now. It\'s not clear if the talks will resume, but some Korean media sites do believe that the partnership could survive and Apple could opt to go with Kia.\n\nApple also allegedly approached Nissan about a potential partnership, but negotiations were brief and did not make it up to executive levels due to disagreements over Apple Car specifics. The two companies clashed over the idea of a partnership, with Nissan worried that Apple would downgrade it to a simple hardware supplier. Apple wants full control over the Apple Car\'s design and software, and Nissan has said that it has no plans to change the way that it makes cars. Nissan has since confirmed that it is not in talks with Apple.\n\nAccording to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple\'s initial vehicle chassis could be based on Hyundai\'s E-GMP electriv vehicle (BEV) platform, which uses up to two motors, five-link rear suspension, an integrated drive axle, battery cells that can provide range over 500km on a full charge, and can be charged up to 80% within 18 minutes through high-speed charging. A high performance model based on E-GMP is capable of accelerating from 0-60 miles per hour in less than 3.5 seconds, with a top speed of 160 miles per hour.\n\nApple may also work with General Motors and European manufacturer PSA for subsequent models or in other markets. Apple\'s ""deep collaboration"" with manufacturing partners will shorten Apple car development time.\n\nBloomberg\'s Mark Gurman has explained that Apple is struggling to find an appropriate existing automaker to build its vehicle and automakers are said to be concerned about the implications of such an agreement on their own brand. As a result, Apple is reportedly looking into contract manufacturers such as Foxconn, which has an existing relationship with the company.\n\nFoxconn is the main assembler of iPhones, and also recently unveiled an electric vehicle chassis and a software platform to help carmakers bring models to market faster. Contract manufacturer Magna is purportedly another possibility, but Apple may also choose to manufacture the vehicle itself.\n\nAccording to The Korea Times, Apple is ""very near"" to signing an agreement with LG Magna e-Powertrain. Apple is apparently comfortable with LG Magna e-Powertrain\'s smaller manufacturing capacity, from which it may be inferred that the company does not intend to produce the vehicle on the same large scale as other major automakers. Apple\'s first-generation of electric vehicles is reportedly seen as an opportunity to evaluate the project\'s marketability, rather than a true mass-market vehicle.\n\nIf the agreement with LG Magna e-Powertrain is reached, the two parties will then jointly establish the precise details for the production of the Apple car, and a prototype will apparently be teased in early 2024.\n\nApple in June 2021 entered into ""early-stage talks"" with two Chinese companies that might supply batteries for a future Apple Car. Apple is discussing battery options with CATL and BYD, with Apple pushing for the building of manufacturing facilities in the United States.\n\nApple may instead be planning to work with Taiwanese manufacturers on batteries that are could be made in the U.S. Taiwan-based Foxconn and Advanced Lithium Electrochemistry both plan to set up factories in the United States that could end up manufacturing batteries for the Apple Car.\n\nApple in 2021 also sent a team of Apple Car employees to South Korea to meet with LG, the SK group, and others to discuss possible business opportunities related to the Apple Car. Apple is continuing to work to find new partners to join its supply chain for the upcoming vehicle. Apple is pursuing companies who can make lithium iron phosphate batteries, which Korean suppliers mass produce.\n\nApple in September was rumored to be visiting Toyota as talks to find and secure suppliers continue.'";"Autonomous Cars";"167.txt-Autonomous Cars"

The accident was described as minor with no injuries.\n\nThe second accident [PDF] occurred on August 23 in Cupertino, California, right near the Apple Park campus. The vehicle with Apple's self-driving equipment was in manual mode and it was stopped in traffic when it was rear ended by a Subaru Outback.\n\nBoth of these incidents were not the fault of the self-driving vehicle or the person operating the vehicle, and are largely not notable. What is interesting, though, is that Apple vehicles were involved in two collisions in the same month after no accidents since September 2019.\n\nEarlier this year, the California DMV's disengagement and mileage reports suggested that Apple's Lexus SUVs with self-driving software traversed more than 18,000 miles in 2020, a steep increase compared to prior years. It's possible that Apple has ramped up its testing in 2021, leading to a higher number of incidents.\n\nApple has been testing its self-driving software since early 2017, using the aforementioned Lexus RX 450h vehicles outfitted with sensors and cameras.

"169.txt";"b'Last Updated 9/222020\n\nAccording to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA),""autonomous"" or ""self-driving"" vehicles are those in which operation of the vehicle occurs without direct driver input to control the steering, acceleration, and braking and are designed so that the driver is not expected to constantly monitor the roadway while operating in self-driving mode. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers predict that 75% of cars on the roads in the world will be autonomous by 2040. Moreover, a 2018 KPMG Study predicts that self-driving cars may become a commercial reality in the next five years.\n\nGoogle is the pioneer in autonomous driving technology. In 2005, Google established a team of engineers, led by Sebastian Thrun, who developed a robotic vehicle that won a contest sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Since 2009, Google (now Waymo), has been test-driving autonomous vehicles on public roads, traveling more than 10 million miles in over 25 U.S. cities. According to previous crash reports, Waymo cars have been in numerous minor accidents, but only one accident in 2016, was reported to be the fault of Google\'s self-driving car. In 2017, the company removed monthly accidents reports from their site and they will no longer be publicly available.\n\nWaymo continues to be the industry leader in driverless technology. In December of 2018, the company officially launched Waymo One, the nation\xe2\x80\x99s first autonomous vehicle taxi service, in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nGoogle believes that self-driving cars can make driving more efficient and safer by eliminating distracted driving and other human error. According to NHTSA, 3,166 fatalities in 2017 were crashes involving distracted drivers, while an additional 10,874 fatalities involved an alcohol-impaired driver. A KMPG report predicts that by 2050, the adoption of autonomous vehicle technology could reduce the frequency of accidents by almost 90%.\n\nAs excitement and momentum for self-driving cars grows, there are numerous insurance questions that will need to be addressed before such vehicles take the road. For example: What happens if a self-driving car gets into an accident? Who is liable for the damages? Will the human ""copilot"" be at fault or will the car\'s manufacturer? Will the \'driver\' have to maintain a constant vigil on the road ahead at all times? What are they allowed to do inside the vehicle\xe2\x80\xa6can they nap, read a book or text message while the car does all the navigating? Will they even need a driver\'s license? A 2017 KMPG report highlights the ""chaotic middle"" the auto insurance industry is facing in this new period.\n\nThere is also a long list of safety and legal issues to iron out before self-driving cars hit the road. In September 2017, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) presented, Automated Driving Systems: A Vision for Safety, as part of U.S. Department of Transportation\'s (DOT) multimodal efforts to support the safe introduction of automation technologies. In July 2018, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) released the Comprehensive Management Plan for Automated Vehicle Initiatives as a response to the requirements in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (Omnibus Bill) signed into law on March 23, 2018, directing the (DOT) to conduct research on the development of Automated Vehicles (AV).\n\nCurrently, twenty-nine states and Washington D.C. have enacted legislation related to autonomous vehicles, while eleven governors issued executive orders regarding autonomous vehicles. Getting the technology to make the vehicles is only half the challenge; the other half will be creating a legal, liability and regulatory framework to govern their use on public streets.\n\nStatus: The NAIC Innovation and Technology (EX) Task Force is charged with monitoring emerging technologies like autonomous vehicles in the insurance sector. The Task Force provides a forum for discussion of innovation and technology developments in the insurance sector to provide resources for and educate state insurance regulators on how these developments impact consumer protection, insurer, and producer oversight. Additionally, the NAIC Center for Insurance Policy and Research (CIPR) held an Autonomous Vehicle forum in October 2018. Resources from this forum are available on the CIPR Events page. The CIPR also hosted a webinar, The Road Ahead for Autonomous Vehicles and Auto Insurance in December 2019.

We\xe2\x80\x99re still years away from that. The challenges range from the technological and legislative to the environmental and philosophical. Here are just some of the unknowns.\n\nLidar and Radar\n\nLidar is expensive and is still trying to strike the right balance between range and resolution. If multiple autonomous cars were to drive on the same road, would their lidar signals interfere with one another? And if multiple radio frequencies are available, will the frequency range be enough to support mass production of autonomous cars?\n\nWeather Conditions\n\nWhat happens when an autonomous car drives in heavy precipitation? If there\xe2\x80\x99s a layer of snow on the road, lane dividers disappear. How will the cameras and sensors track lane markings if the markings are obscured by water, oil, ice, or debris?\n\nTraffic Conditions and Laws\n\nWill autonomous cars have trouble in tunnels or on bridges? How will they do in bumper-to-bumper traffic? Will autonomous cars be relegated to a specific lane? Will they be granted carpool lane access? And what about the fleet of legacy cars still sharing the roadways for the next 20 or 30 years?\n\nState vs. Federal Regulation\n\nThe regulatory process in the U.S. has recently shifted from federal guidance to state-by-state mandates for autonomous cars. Some states have even proposed a per-mile tax on autonomous vehicles to prevent the rise of \xe2\x80\x9czombie cars\xe2\x80\x9d driving around without passengers. Lawmakers have also written bills proposing that all autonomous cars must be zero-emission vehicles and have a panic button installed. But are the laws going to be different from state to state? Will you be able to cross state lines with an autonomous car?\n\nAccident Liability\n\nWho is liable for accidents caused by an autonomous car? The manufacturer? The human passenger? The latest blueprints suggest that a fully autonomous Level 5 car will not have a dashboard or a steering wheel, so a human passenger would not even have the option to take control of the vehicle in an emergency.\n\nArtificial vs. Emotional Intelligence\n\nHuman drivers rely on subtle cues and non-verbal communication\xe2\x80\x94like making eye contact with pedestrians or reading the facial expressions and body language of other drivers\xe2\x80\x94to make split-second judgment calls and predict behaviors. Will autonomous cars be able to replicate this connection? Will they have the same life-saving instincts as human drivers?'";"Autonomous Cars";"17.txt-Autonomous Cars"
"173.txt";"b'Autonomous vehicles are also known as self-driving cars, driverless cars, or robotic cars. The term self-driving car is becoming a standard as these technologies continue to mature.\n\nAutonomous vehicles rely on advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) systems to \xe2\x80\x9cunderstand\xe2\x80\x9d their environment and react to commands. Complex sensors and actuators, together with advanced computer vision functions are used to create a constantly updated map of their surroundings, detect the presence of nearby vehicles and pedestrians, measure distances and detect uneven surfaces in roads and sidewalks. Autonomous vehicles can also be interconnected with other external devices such as smart traffic lights and roads, although many of these ideas are still hypothetical.\n\nAn autonomous vehicle is a vehicle that can drive itself without input from a human driver. There are several types of self-driving vehicles, depending on their level of automation. These levels have been defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) which has set 6 of them adopted by the U.S. Department of Transportation ranging from Level 0 (fully manual) to Level 5 (fully autonomous).\n\nTechopedia Explains Autonomous Vehicle\n\nIn some ways, the story of the autonomous vehicle is a tale of technological evolution that is not finished yet, a gradual advance of integrated artificial intelligence services and sensor-based driver safety features that may or may not eventually replace human drivers entirely.\n\nAutonomous cars must rely on the presence of sensors situated in various parts of the vehicle to sense their surroundings. Lidar is mostly used for ranging purposes, measure distances, identify lane markings and anomalies such as holes and pits on the road.\n\nRadar sensors are used to track other vehicles, while video cameras can be used to read road signs and detect traffic lights. Advanced AI-powered software will then process all those inputs coming from sensors, and generate instructions to the car\xe2\x80\x99s actuators to plot paths, control steering, braking and acceleration, or dodge obstacles.\n\nEarly Advances in Autonomous Vehicles\n\nThe earliest edge of the autonomous driving frontier was the evolution of multiple driver safety features that are now standard in many new vehicles. For example, a lane departure warning system alerts drivers if the vehicle seems to be leaving a particular space on a multilane road. Parking assist features, automated braking, and other features also apply. Each one has its own specialized function and controls a given task.\n\nWhat these systems have in common is that, although they promote the idea of autonomous vehicle design, they still do not approach what some would call a self-driving car. The human driver is still in control, and needs to be in control, but utilizes the warnings and alerts to make better driving decisions.\n\nThese forms of partial automation that still require a human driver pertain to the SAE levels 0 to 2. Only when the automated system is in charge of monitoring the driving environment and human intervention is purely optional then a vehicle could be defined as \xe2\x80\x9cautonomous\xe2\x80\x9d (levels 3 to 5). As we progress toward autonomous vehicle design, intermediate types of autopilot systems are becoming more common, with Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s one being probably the most prominent.\n\nObstacles to Adoption of Autonomous Cars Technology\n\nFully autonomous (Level 5) vehicles are currently being tested, but we\xe2\x80\x99re still far from making them available to the general public. Although the autonomous vehicle has come a long way, it is not yet a common mode of transportation, and various obstacles to adoption apply.\n\nIn particular, some of the technologies required for build a functional self-driving car very expensive, making the final cost of each vehicle prohibitive for the general public. Radar and Lidar work for prototypes, but if mass production is achieved, their signals and frequency might interfere with one another.\n\nMany anomalous conditions such as snow, debris or oil may represent a significant challenge whenever they cover lane markings and dividers. Also, it\xe2\x80\x99s still early to trust AI to be smart enough to make consistent decisions or split-second judgement calls in life-or-death scenarios, such as when a pedestrian suddenly traverses the road after a steep turn.'";"Autonomous Cars";"173.txt-Autonomous Cars"

Since the company\xe2\x80\x99s founding in Fremont, California in late 2016, the company\xe2\x80\x99s been making strides in autonomous mobility deployment in both the U.S. and China. The company was the first to launch and offer a public-facing Robotaxi service in both countries.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe technology is moving from experience-level to application,\xe2\x80\x9d Peng says. \xe2\x80\x9cThe first half of the game is to build stable and mature products and accumulate experience. The second half is to move from R&D to mass production and scale, in addition to achieving commercially viable products.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn 2019, Peng predicted that the world would see a wide adoption of fully autonomous driving vehicles on the open roads within five years, and that forecast is gaining momentum. Pony.ai just received a driverless permit from California DMV, a milestone for their engineers to perform driverless testing without a human driver behind the wheel on public roads within the state. These tests are accelerating commercial growth across their operation sites worldwide, and they plan to launch driverless Robotaxi service to the public in California starting in 2022.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m pretty confident that in many of the larger cities in the U.S., people will soon be able to ride with a driverless Robotaxi vehicle,\xe2\x80\x9d says Tiancheng Lou, CTO at Pony.ai. \xe2\x80\x9cA significant portion of taxi services will be supported by driverless vehicles.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPony.ai currently offers ride-hailing in its autonomous vehicles in five markets: Irvine and Fremont in California; as well as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou in China. The company plans to install its technology in hundreds of vehicles next year, rising to tens of thousands in 2024-2025.\n\nWaymo, Google\xe2\x80\x99s self-driving car arm, has been piloting a fleet of fully driverless robotaxis in Phoenix for the past year, while Amazon-owned Zoox unveiled its autonomous robotaxi service last December.\n\nThe goals of autonomous driving\n\nAccording to most companies, the biggest benefit of autonomous driving is safety. The U.S. Department of Transportation has reported that 94% of car crashes are caused by human error. While overall driving was down in 2020 because of the pandemic, traffic fatality rates surged 24% \xe2\x80\x94 the highest spike in nearly a century. Autonomous driving is the solution to this issue, Peng says, and companies like Pony.ai, Google, and Uber, along with most of the major automakers, are sinking considerable money into R&D, optimistic about the future of autonomous driving.\n\nA transition to autonomous vehicles also has potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and support U.S. economic growth, points out the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets. The coalition, which includes members Ford, Volvo, Lyft, Uber, and Waymo, promotes the benefits of fully self-driving vehicles and supports the fastest deployment possible \xe2\x80\x93 or advancing the scale of the technology, which would enable mass production and start moving autonomous vehicles to the center of the smart city vision.\n\nChallenges of driving autonomy at scale\n\nPony is hoping to achieve large enough scale to reduce costs and meet commercial needs by 2022 with Alpha X, the working name for their latest generation of autonomous vehicles, Lou says, which are designed to be manufactured on a production line.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo have a large number of vehicles, we need to manufacture them in a standardized way,\xe2\x80\x9d Lou says. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a critical step to achieve front-loading mass production of self-driving cars.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe company established a production line and a set of standardized processes specifically for L4-level autonomous driving systems last November. With the support of the production line, the production efficiency of the autonomous driving system doubled six times compared with the previous generation, and production pace accelerated.\n\nWith PonyAlpha X, they established a L4 level autonomous driving system scale production line, Lou says. To manufacture the vehicle, they established a supply chain management process, hardware module design and verification, test production, and car conversion before final assembly. The end phase consists of overall quality inspection, off-line calibration, and road testing. The project helps them set up a standardized production process, which shortened production time, effectively reduced costs, and improved the stability of the overall system.\n\nCompared with the previous generation, PonyAlpha X is more compact, integrated, and lightweight in terms of system hardware integration, reducing the cost of post-maintenance. They recently partnered with Toyota to equip PonyAlpha X on Lexus RX models.\n\nIn February of this year, the company rolled out the new self-driving vehicles equipped with the latest generation system from the standardized production line. The cars will go through all-day autonomous-driving open-road tests in Guangzhou, Beijing, and Shanghai before they join the company\xe2\x80\x99s Robotaxi fleet for large-scale operations.\n\nTheir recent partnership with Luminar, an autonomous vehicle sensor and software company, has also allowed them to significantly bring down the cost of manufacturing, which is always a major hurdle for mass production.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the next generation, one of the biggest challenges is we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to use auto-grade sensors,\xe2\x80\x9d Lou says. \xe2\x80\x9cOne of the critical pieces is Luminar LiDAR. Using that LiDAR, we\xe2\x80\x99re moving one step toward to being ready for mass production, and then we can prepare for large scale production. Luminar LiDAR, compared to our current solution, is more reliable and much cheaper.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLiDAR is a laser sensor that sends millions of laser points out per second and measures how long they take to bounce back, a key component to safe autonomous driving. Luminar says that its Iris LiDAR has a maximum range of 500 meters (1,640 feet), including 250-meter range with less than 10 percent reflectivity. The self-driving sensor solution offers better perception accuracy and field of view breadth to enhance the ability to cope with long-tail scenarios. The new pony vehicles with Luminar\xe2\x80\x99s LiDAR sensor will be up and running in 2022, and will be ready for the company\xe2\x80\x99s robotaxi customers in 2023.\n\nAutonomous driving at scale is, literally, in sight\n\nThe past year hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been easy, Lou says, but it pushed their contactless delivery initiative further along in Irvine, which helped the community cope during the pandemic, while adding testing and collecting mileage for data points. But full autonomy at scale still requires testing.\n\nTo help accelerate their commercial growth and global deployment, they\xe2\x80\x99ve tapped Lawrence Steyn, vice chairman of investment banking at JPMorgan Chase & Co, as chief financial officer.\n\nAnd looking ahead, in 10 years or 20 years, it could be possible that owning a vehicle would entirely be a luxury, Lou says.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe need to carefully think about whether that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary, having personal vehicles,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it\xe2\x80\x99s mathematically possible to get a vehicle within as little as 30 seconds, most people may not have to own a vehicle.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe also points out that if most vehicles are running autonomously, the vehicle form factor can be reshaped for accessibility, opening up safe transportation for a larger population of older and disabled riders who could turn to cheaper, more efficient autonomous transportation for their travel needs.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI still keep the engineering part in me, and with that part, I dream of pushing the world forward with state-of-art technology,\xe2\x80\x9d Peng says. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are working hard to largely scale and deploy our technology across countries and regions to benefit more and more people.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDig deeper.

"177.txt";"b'These Vehicles Can Almost Drive Themselves There is no such thing as a self-driving car. Let\xe2\x80\x99s make that clear right away, not a single car on the road today can operate in all types of weather and driving conditions without any human intervention. That type of vehicle, one with what\xe2\x80\x99s called Level 5 autonomy (which we\'ll explain in further detail later), remains years into the future. This doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean many cars on sale today don\xe2\x80\x99t have impressive technology that\xe2\x80\x99s making them increasingly smarter and safer. Some of these driving aids are targeted at reducing driver stress, by taking over some or all steering functions, or automatically matching the car\xe2\x80\x99s speed to posted road signs. Certain systems, like Cadillac\xe2\x80\x99s Super Cruise, can only be used within specific parameters, such as pre-mapped divided highways with dedicated on- and off-ramps. There are also a number of active safety features, such as automatic emergency braking, that help minimize the risk of an accident by stopping the car if sensors detect an obstacle. While the era of robot cars hasn\xe2\x80\x99t yet arrived, let\xe2\x80\x99s look at examples of self-driving technology available today.\n\n<h3><strong>What Are the Levels of Vehicle Autonomy?</strong></h3> <p>To make things as simple as possible, let\xe2\x80\x99s explain the five levels of vehicle autonomy before we look at the cars and SUVs on this list. The levels of autonomy are determined by SAE International, a professional group of worldwide engineers devoted to establishing standardized values for the transportation field. To better understand self-driving cars, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand each level of autonomy.</p> <p>Level 0 means the car is always under human control. Cars in this category can have active safety features, like automatic emergency braking and forward collision warning, but these features only offer visual or audible alerts, and they never actively control the car.</p> <p>Level 1 vehicles might include adaptive cruise control or lane keep assist. These safety features are capable of providing a small degree of steering, acceleration, or braking input. However, their primary focus is accident avoidance. </p> <p>Level 2 autonomy entails several active safety features working in unison to take some degree of driving duty away from the driver. Onboard cameras and radar sensors could keep the car driving at a steady speed in its intended lane of travel, for example, and clear of surrounding vehicles. At this level you\xe2\x80\x99ll find a number of today\xe2\x80\x99s self-driving systems, such as Cadillac Super Cruise and Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s AutoPilot. One key thing to remember: A Level 2 vehicle requires the driver to remain focused on the road. This can be done via cameras that monitor the driver\xe2\x80\x99s eyes or sensors that can tell if the driver lets go of the steering wheel.</p> <p>At Level 3, a vehicle takes over all driving controls in select conditions and allows the driver to focus elsewhere. These conditions might be specific types of highway, or geofenced locations. The vehicle may not be able to drive itself in poor weather.</p> <p>At Level 4, the self-driving car is able to adapt to more road and weather conditions. The limitations of Level 3 are lessened, and the vehicle theoretically requires almost no driver input.</p> <p>Finally, at Level 5, the car drives all the time, no matter the type of road or weather outside. This robo-car is the end game for self-driving technology, though it remains years into the future.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>2020 Tesla Model S</strong></h3> <p><strong>Price w/ Autonomous Driving Features: $69,420 | U.S. News Overall Score: 9.0/10</strong></p> <p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s start with the car company and electric-powered sedan that put self-driving technology on the map. True, the idea of robo-cars didn\xe2\x80\x99t start with Tesla, but the Silicon Valley-based automaker has put them front and center in terms of cutting-edge car technology. </p> <p>Every <a href=""/cars-trucks/tesla/model-s/2020"">Model S</a> is fitted with Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s AutoPilot self-driving aid, though you can upgrade to the Full Self-Driving Capability package for an extra $8,000. While AutoPilot maintains vehicle speed and keeps the Model S in its intended lane of travel, Full Self-Driving Capability allows for lane changes (if the sensors detect it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to do so), automatic parking assist, and a mode to summon the car from a parking spot. </p> <p>Tesla remains at the forefront of this technology, though the company\xe2\x80\x99s reputation has been dinged by high profile accidents while its vehicles were operating with some degree of autonomy. This has often been linked to driver inattention, though the fact that AutoPilot usage is not geo-fenced to certain roads \xe2\x80\x93 such as the next system we\xe2\x80\x99re going to discuss \xe2\x80\x93 has been a heated safety topic.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>2020 Cadillac CT6</strong></h3> <p><strong>Price w/ Autonomous Driving Features: $74,495 | U.S. News Overall Score: 7.2/10</strong></p> <p>While Tesla has adopted a more free-spirited attitude to self-driving assistance, the Cadillac Super Cruise system takes a more measured approach. Like Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s AutoPilot, when Super Cruise is in operation the car maintains its speed, distance to other vehicles, and adheres to its intended lane of travel. </p> <p>Unlike some rival lane keep assist technology, Super Cruise is credited for being very smooth and avoiding the \xe2\x80\x98ping-pong\xe2\x80\x99 feel that other systems cause as onboard sensors read and respond to lane markings. This is a hands-free system, but a camera in the interior keeps an eye on the driver to make certain they\xe2\x80\x99re looking ahead and paying attention. If that isn\xe2\x80\x99t the case, Super Cruise will issue a series of visual and audible alerts. Should this still not get the driver\xe2\x80\x99s attention, the car will turn on its hazard lights and slow to a stop in its lane of travel.</p> <p>Available on the <a href=""/cars-trucks/cadillac/ct6/2020"">CT6</a> luxury sedan in the Premium Luxury trim level, Super Cruise can only be activated on divided highways with dedicated on-ramps and off-ramps. </p> <p>As of this writing, roughly 130,000 miles of roads throughout North America have been programmed into Super Cruise. For the 2021 model year, this technology will be available in the new <a href=""/cars-trucks/cadillac/escalade/2021"">Escalade</a> full-size SUV, along with the <a href=""/cars-trucks/cadillac/ct4/2020"">CT4</a> and <a href=""/cars-trucks/cadillac/ct5/2020"">CT5</a> sedans.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>2020 Nissan Rogue</strong></h3> <p><strong>Price w/ Autonomous Driving Features: $28,670 | U.S. News Overall Score: 7.6/10</strong></p> <p>Nissan takes a slightly simpler approach with its self-driving technology.

ProPilot offers more of a gentle nudge in corners, though sharper bends will cause it to default back to the driver\'s control. </p> <p>Nissan touts ProPilot Assist as a way to relieve daily driving stresses and it will feature in more models in the years ahead. A more advanced ProPilot Assist 2.0 system is also on the road, though it\xe2\x80\x99s not yet in the U.S. market.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>2020 BMW X7</strong></h3> <p><strong>Price w/ Autonomous Driving Features: $75,600 | U.S. News Overall Score: 7.7/10</strong></p> <p>The <a href=""/cars-trucks/bmw/x7/2020"">BMW X7</a> is the German automaker\xe2\x80\x99s largest SUV and one of several models in which you can order hands-free parallel parking assist, along with traffic jam assist.

This feature can be had on several BMW vehicles, including the <a href=""/cars-trucks/bmw/7-series/2020"">7 Series</a> and <a href=""/cars-trucks/bmw/5-series/2020"">5 Series</a> sedans.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>2020 Infiniti QX50</strong></h3> <p><strong>Price w/ Autonomous Driving Features: $52,575 | U.S. News Overall Score: 7.5/10</strong></p> <p>If you\xe2\x80\x99d like Nissan\xe2\x80\x99s ProPilot Assist system in fancier packaging, consider the <a href=""/cars-trucks/infiniti/qx50/2020"">Infiniti QX50</a>. The QX50 is a five-passenger compact SUV that comes standard with active safety items like automatic emergency braking, forward and rear collision warning, pedestrian detection, rear cross traffic alert, and more. </p> <p>ProPilot Assist works like it does in the <a href=""/cars-trucks/nissan/rogue/2020"">Nissan Rogue</a> and <a href=""/cars-trucks/nissan/leaf/2020"">Leaf EV</a>, the driver must keep their hands on the wheel as the system controls speed, braking, and a degree of steering and lane guidance.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>2020 Volvo XC60</strong></h3> <p><strong>Price w/ Autonomous Driving Features: $45,500 | U.S. News Overall Score: 8.3/10</strong></p> <p>Volvo has a sterling reputation when it comes to safety technology, so you can trust the company won\xe2\x80\x99t have a Wild West approach to self-driving aids. </p> <p>Pilot Assist is a hands-on system that operates at speeds up to 80 mph. The system maintains speed, distance to cars ahead, and keeps the vehicle in its intended lane of travel. A warning is emitted if the vehicle determines the driver does not have his or her hands on the steering wheel. </p> <p>Unlike some self-driving systems, Pilot Assist is not relegated only to the priciest range-topping trims. The feature is available on the entry-level <a href=""/cars-trucks/volvo/xc60/2020"">XC60</a> T5 trim level in front-wheel-drive format and with the base 250-horsepower turbocharged four-cylinder engine. Forward progress is smooth, if not exactly overpowering with this engine. If you prefer an extra jolt of acceleration, a turbocharged and supercharged four-cylinder is available, as is a plug-in hybrid variant. No matter which engine you choose, the cabin of the XC60 is superbly designed, elegantly appointed, and extremely comfortable.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>2020 Mercedes-Benz S-Class</strong></h3> <p><strong>Price w/ Autonomous Driving Features: $102,510 | U.S. News Overall Score: 9.1/10</strong></p> <p>The <a href=""/cars-trucks/mercedes-benz/s-class/2020"">Mercedes-Benz S-Class</a> is a technical powerhouse that sits atop the brand\xe2\x80\x99s range of luxury sedans.

This allows vehicles equipped with this tech to \xe2\x80\x98speak\xe2\x80\x99 to each other to issue warnings about potential road hazards or slippery road conditions. In addition to its long lineup of available active safety features, such as evasive steering assist and automatic speed limit assist, the S-Class can be equipped with Night Vision. This helps to spot animals or objects that normal headlights might fail to illuminate in time to avoid an accident.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>2021 Toyota RAV4</strong></h3> <p><strong>Price w/ Autonomous Driving Features: $26,050 | U.S. News Overall Score: 8.0/10</strong></p> <p>So far most of our focus has been on systems that actively take over speed, steering, and braking functions. While Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s AutoPilot and Cadillac\xe2\x80\x99s Super Cruise self-driving aids are impressive, they don\xe2\x80\x99t come cheap. While this technology trickles down to less expensive makes and models, many of today\xe2\x80\x99s most popular cars and SUVs deliver a surprising amount of active safety features as standard equipment. </p> <p>The <a href=""/cars-trucks/toyota/rav4/2021"">Toyota RAV4</a> is an extremely popular compact SUV that happens to come with a long lineup of active safety features for a starting price of around $26,000.

"18.txt";"b""Imagine getting into your car, typing\xe2\x80\x94or, better yet speaking\xe2\x80\x94a location into your vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s interface, then letting it drive you to your destination while you read a book, surf the web, or nap. Self-driving vehicles\xe2\x80\x94the stuff of science fiction since the first roads were paved\xe2\x80\x94are coming, and they\xe2\x80\x99re going to radically change what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to get from point A to point B.\n\nIn 2009, Google started the self-driving car project with the goal of driving autonomously over ten uninterrupted 100-mile routes. In 2016, Waymo, an autonomous driving technology company, became a subsidiary of Alphabet, and Google's self-driving project became Waymo.\n\nSince then, Waymo has invited the public to join the first public trial of autonomous vehicles operated by the Waymo Driver and introduced its first fully autonomous vehicles operated by the Waymo Driver on public roads without anyone in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat.\n\nKey Takeaways The hype around driverless cars has grown rapidly over the past several years, with many big technology companies getting behind the concept.\n\nGoogle launched its Waymo division to develop and market consumer-ready driverless vehicles around the globe.\n\nThe company, along with several others in the tech and auto industries, is betting that driverless cars will soon change the way we get around in a major way.\n\nAmong the revolutionary changes will be safer roads, fewer fossil fuels, and lower transportation costs.\n\nBasic Technology Already In Use\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe building blocks of driverless cars are on the road now,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Russ Rader, senior vice president of communications at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf. He pointed to the front-crash prevention systems that for several years have been able to warn drivers of an impending obstacle and apply the brakes if they don\xe2\x80\x99t react fast enough.\n\nThese systems were quickly followed by technology that allows cars to self-park by sizing up a free spot and automatically steering into it, with the driver only controlling the accelerator and brake pedals. Mercedes-Benz took autonomous driving even further when they introduced Drive Pilot, which allows the driver to hand over direct control of steering and speed in certain circumstances, while still supervising the overall operation of the car.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nIn 2018, Waymo announced that they would be making self-driving cars available by 2020. However, despite some extraordinary advancements, in the year 2020, self-driving cars are still out of reach, except in some trial programs.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf The current technology on the market is limited to cars that will automatically brake for you if they anticipate a collision, cars that help keep you in your lane, and cars that can mostly handle highway driving.\n\nThe idea behind self-driving cars is fairly simple: build a car with cameras that can track all the objects around it. The car should react if it\xe2\x80\x99s about to steer into one. And once in-car computers know all driving rules, they should be able to navigate to their destination. In the end, you might say that the execution of these ideas has been more complicated than was anticipated.\n\nWaymo's cars, the leader in self-driving technology, use high-resolution cameras and lidar (light detection and ranging, which is a way of estimating the distance to another object by bouncing light and sound off things). This technology helps the self-driving car identify where other cars, cyclists, pedestrians, and obstacles are and where they\xe2\x80\x99re moving.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nA Drastic Change\n\nWith the adoption of any new revolutionary technology, it is predicted there will be problems for businesses that don\xe2\x80\x99t adjust fast enough to future developments in self-driving car technology. Futurists estimate that hundreds of billions of dollars (if not trillions) will be lost by automakers, suppliers, dealers, insurers, parking companies, and many other car-related enterprises. And think of the lost revenue for governments via licensing fees, taxes and tolls, and by personal injury lawyers and health insurers.\n\nWho needs a car made with heavier-gauge steel and eight airbags (not to mention a body shop) if accidents are so rare? Who needs a parking spot close to work if your car can drive you there, park itself miles away, only to pick you up later? Who needs to buy a flight from Boston to Cleveland when you can leave in the evening, sleep much of the way, and arrive in the morning?\n\nIndeed, one of Google\xe2\x80\x99s goals is to facilitate car-sharing.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf That means fewer cars on the road. Fewer cars, period. Who needs to own a car when you can just order a shared one and it\xe2\x80\x99ll drive up minutes later, ready to take you wherever you want?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis [has the potential to] dramatically reduce the number of cars on the street, 80% of which have people driving alone in them, and also a household's cost of transportation, which is 18% of their income\xe2\x80\x94around $9,000 a year\xe2\x80\x94for an asset that they use only 5% of the time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Robin Chase, the founder and CEO of Buzzcar, a peer-to-peer car-sharing service, and co-founder and former CEO of Zipcar.\n\nIn 2030, self-driving cars are expected to create $87 billion worth of opportunities for automakers and technology developers, said a report by Boston-based Lux Research.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf Software developers stand to win big.\n\nA Manufacturing Revolution\n\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re an automaker, such as Ford Motor Co. (F), General Motors Co. (GM), Chrysler Group LLC, Toyota Motor Corp. or Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (HMC), which account for almost 70% of the U.S. market, you could see an initial surge in the $600 billion in annual new and used car sales globally.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf \xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf But as soon as the technology takes hold, sales could fall off significantly as sharing popularizes.\n\nCars will always need steel, glass, an interior, a drivetrain, and some form of human interface (even if that interface is little more than a wireless connection to your smartphone). But much of everything else could change. As an example, take front-facing seats; they could become an option, not a requirement. Automakers that see the changes coming\xe2\x80\x94such as how the big profits are secured downstream by car servicers, insurers, and more\xe2\x80\x94are focusing on services as much as on what and how they manufacture.\n\nInfrastructure Transformation\n\nWith fewer cars around, parking lots and spaces that cover roughly one-third of the land area of many U.S. cities can be repurposed. That could mean temporary downward pressure on real estate values as supply increases. It could also mean greener urban areas and revitalized suburbs if longer commutes become more palatable. And if fewer cars are on the road, federal, state, and local government agencies may be able to reallocate a good portion of the roughly $180 billion spent annually on highways and roads.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nChanging Oil Demand\n\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re in the business of finding, extracting, refining, and marketing hydrocarbons, such as Exxon Mobil (EOX), Chevron (CVX), or BP (BP), you could see your business fluctuate as use changes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese vehicles should practice very efficient eco-driving practices, which is typically about 20% better than the average driver,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chase. \xe2\x80\x9cOn the other hand, if these cars are owned by individuals, I see a huge rise in the number of trips, and vehicle miles traveled. People will send out their car to run errands they would never do if they had to be in the car and waste their own time. If the autonomous cars are shared vehicles and people pay for each trip, I think this will reduce demand, and thus (vehicle miles traveled).\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSafety Dividend\n\nAutonomous vehicles are also expected to be safer. \xe2\x80\x9cThese cars won't get drunk or high, drive too fast, or take unnecessary risks\xe2\x80\x94things people do all the time,\xe2\x80\x9d Chase said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOver 90% of accidents today are caused by driver error,\xe2\x80\x9d said Professor Robert W. Peterson of the Center for Insurance Law and Regulation at Santa Clara University School of Law. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is every reason to believe that self-driving cars will reduce the frequency and severity of accidents, so insurance costs should fall, perhaps dramatically.\xe2\x80\x9d\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCars can still get flooded, damaged, or stolen,\xe2\x80\x9d notes Michael Barry, vice president of media relations at the Insurance Information Institute. \xe2\x80\x9cBut this technology will have a dramatic impact on underwriting. A lot of traditional underwriting criteria will be upended.\xe2\x80\x9d\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nBarry said it\xe2\x80\x99s too early to quantify exactly how self-driving vehicles will affect rates, but added that injured parties in a crash involving a self-driving car may choose to sue the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s manufacturer or the software company that designed the autonomous capability.\n\nInitially, insurers such as State Farm Insurance, Allstate Corp. (ALL), Liberty Mutual Group, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\xe2\x80\x99s (BRK-A) GEICO, Citigroup Inc.\xe2\x80\x99s (C) Travelers Group could see a huge benefit from lower accident liabilities. But they may wind up losing a big portion of the $200 billion in personal auto premiums they write every year as fewer cars take to the road.\n\nSome experts have even speculated that mandatory insurance for cars could be dropped. And as long as we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about financial services, what about the multitude of banks and creditors that lend buyers money in about 85% of car purchases if sales volume falls?\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nAccording to a University of Texas report, if only 10% of the cars on U.S. roads were autonomous, almost $30 billion of savings could be realized via less wasted time and fuel, as well as fewer injuries and deaths. At 90%, the benefit rises to almost $120 billion a year.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nCloser to Home\n\nSelf-driving cars could have a substantial impact on the taxi and limousine industries and could potentially create new ones. Chase noted that they could be used to share specific trips, as a kind of pay-as-you-go small-scale public transportation\xe2\x80\x94for example, taking a disparate bunch of Manhattanites to the same beach in the Hamptons in one trip.\n\nOne study found that a fleet of 9,000 driverless taxis could serve all of Manhattan at about $0.50 per mile (compared to about $5 per mile now). At the time the study was published, there were licenses for over 13,000 taxis in New York City.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nSelf-driving cars may also challenge train lines. \xe2\x80\x9cA self-driving car offers much of the convenience of rail service with the added convenience that the service is portal-to-portal rather than station-to-station,\xe2\x80\x9d Peterson said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the other hand, a fleet of self-driving cars available at the station may make rail service more palatable. \xe2\x80\x9cThe technology has already been adopted in closed systems, such as campuses, air-terminals, and mining,\xe2\x80\x9d he noted. \xe2\x80\x9cRio Tinto Group (RIO), a large mining company, uses enormous self-driving trucks in its mining operations. European countries are experimenting with the platooning of trucks. Among other things, this saves about 18% in fuel.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRisks and Hurdles\n\nThere are regulatory and legislative obstacles to the widespread use of self-driving cars and substantial concerns about privacy. (Who will have access to any driving information these vehicles store?) There\xe2\x80\x99s also the question of security, as hackers could theoretically take control of these vehicles, and are not known for their restraint or civic-mindedness.\n\nThe Future of Waymo\n\nIn March 2020, Waymo Via, the trucking division of Waymo, was launched. According to Google, since 2017 Waymo Driver had been learning to drive large Class 8 trucks in the same way that it had learned how to drive passenger vehicles. Waymo is currently testing its fleet of trucks in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, and has launched a pilot program for local delivery in the Phoenix, Arizona area.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nWaymo has partnerships with multiple vehicle manufacturers to integrate its technology. In October 2020, Waymo and Daimler Trucks partnered to create an autonomous version of the Freightliner Cascadia truck. This is Waymo's first foray into the freight industry. Daimler's trucks will be equipped with autonomous technology that allows them to drive without a human but only in pre-defined areas.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nGoogle\xe2\x80\x99s Self-Driving Car FAQs\n\nIs Google Making a Car?\n\nGoogle has made it clear that it has no plans to build cars itself. Waymo is a self-driving technology company; it does not intend to manufacture and sell its own line of vehicles.\n\nWhat Year Will There Be Self-Driving Cars?\n\nEarly estimates about self-driving cars being the norm by 2020 have turned into having a few research vehicles on the road by 2020. Even if the technology is not developing as fast as expected, computer-processing capabilities and sophisticated artificial intelligence systems are becoming more advanced and more affordable every year. It's not clear when all the pieces will truly fall into place to allow for driverless technologies to safely navigate public roads among traditional cars. While experts agree that there will be a time in the future when this is true, they disagree on the timeline.\n\nHow Much Does the Google Car Cost?\n\nGoogle does not manufacture or sell its own cars. However, you can purchase a semi-autonomous Honda Civic that comes with advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) that control the steering, lane changing, acceleration, and braking while the car is cruising on the highway. You can also purchase a Tesla Motors vehicle that comes equipped with its semi-autonomous Autopilot feature.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nHowever it plays out, these vehicles are coming\xe2\x80\x94and fast. Their full adoption will take decades, but their convenience, cost, safety, and other factors will make them ubiquitous and indispensable. Such as with any technological revolution, the companies that plan ahead, adjust the fastest, and imagine the biggest will survive and thrive. And companies invested in old technology and practices will need to evolve or risk dying.""";"Autonomous Cars";"18.txt-Autonomous Cars"
"180.txt";"b'While the major automakers are developing autonomous vehicles behind closed doors, we were able to experience Audi\xe2\x80\x99s latest prototype at Las Vegas\xe2\x80\x99 CES show in January. California, Florida, Michigan, and Nevada are the only states, along with Washington, D.C., that currently allow companies to test such vehicles on public roads.\n\nAudi\xe2\x80\x99s A7 test car is equipped with the company\xe2\x80\x99s traffic-jam assist feature, which uses an array of cameras, sensors, and radar to let the car take over the driving in highway traffic. In the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat was Bj\xc3\xb6rn Giesler, Ph.D., project leader for development of piloted driving at Audi AG, and in the backseat was an engineer equipped with a laptop and radio to monitor the system and communicate with our police escorts and other Audi vehicles.\n\nDuring rush-hour traffic, we headed out on Route 15, one of Las Vegas\xe2\x80\x99 major freeways. With the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s speed under 40 mph, a notification appeared that the system\xe2\x80\x99s pilot mode was available. Then with the push of a button on the steering wheel, the car took control and the instrument cluster graphic changed to an illustration of the road with vehicles in the lanes.\n\nAs Giesler took his hands off the wheel and his foot off the pedals, the vehicle seamlessly followed the car in front at a safe distance. When a vehicle cut into our lane, the A7 automatically slowed down and adjusted the distance. When that car moved out of the lane, our car again closed the gap with the next car in front. The driver can turn off the system at any time by placing his hands on the steering wheel and foot back on the pedals.\n\nWith the A7 in control, the driver could do other things, although sleeping was not one of them. The vehicle was equipped with two cameras with facial recognition that monitored the driver\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. Giesler showed off that feature in an unnerving moment. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to lie to you, this is still pretty scary for me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said as he pretended to sleep. After about 10 seconds the vehicle noticed. An audible alert sounded and, when he still didn\xe2\x80\x99t open his eyes, the vehicle shut down in the middle of the highway and activated the hazard lights. That is a safeguard on the prototype A7 in case the driver is ill or incapacitated. But production cars will be designed so that they can make autonomous lane changes, which will allow the vehicle to safely pull off the road.\n\nDuring the demonstration, Giesler pointed out an eye-opening reminder of how quickly the technology is advancing. The previous year the test car\xe2\x80\x99s trunk was filled with three desktop-sized computers to make the system work. This year the hardware had been reduced to the size of a small box, which was tucked away in the trunk\xe2\x80\x99s side storage compartment.\n\nOverall we were quite impressed with the Audi\xe2\x80\x99s capabilities. The company expects the technology to be available in a production car within five years.'";"Autonomous Cars";"180.txt-Autonomous Cars"

The company, a division of Intel (INTC), describes NYC as \xe2\x80\x9cone of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most challenging driving environments\xe2\x80\x9d and says the data from the trial will push full self-driving capability closer to prime time.\n\nIn an interview, Mobileye CEO Amnon Shashua said fully autonomous cars could be in showrooms by the end of President Biden\xe2\x80\x99s first term. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have contracts underway with car makers for the 2024 or 2025 time frame,\xe2\x80\x9d Shashua told Yahoo Finance. \xe2\x80\x9cA level 4 vehicle can be purchased by a consumer at a very, very reasonable add-on cost.\xe2\x80\x9d Level 4 is the second-highest level of vehicle autonomy and it means a driver is never needed.\n\nSystems on the market today, including Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s Autopilot and General Motors\xe2\x80\x99 Supercruise, are Level 2 autonomy, which means computers can control steering and speed but the driver needs to be ready to intervene if necessary. Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s system has been controversial because of several fatal crashes that occurred with Autopilot engaged. Drivers may have mistakenly thought the system could avoid all hazards, which it\xe2\x80\x99s not yet designed to do. The Transportation Department\'s safety agency is investigating at least 30 Tesla crashes involving 10 deaths.\n\nMobileye\xe2\x80\x99s CEO Amnon Shashua poses with a Mobileye driverless vehicle at the Nasdaq Market site in New York, U.S., July 20, 2021. REUTERS/Jeenah Moon\n\nMobileye and Tesla on different paths\n\nMobileye supplied autonomous systems for Tesla in the past, but the two companies went different directions on the technology. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are on diverging paths,\xe2\x80\x9d Shashua says. \xe2\x80\x9cThere may be places in which we can collaborate again, but being a full stack supplier to Tesla, that is something that was in the past and is not going to occur again.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nStory continues\n\nMobileye\xe2\x80\x99s self-driving systems compete with those being developed by Alphabet\xe2\x80\x99s (GOOG) Waymo division and other suppliers. Tesla is developing its own system. Most automakers, including General Motors (GM) and Ford (F), use proprietary in-house technology along with systems provided by suppliers such as Mobileye. Autonomous vehicles are complex and a handful of sophisticated firms will probably end up dominating the market, which is likely to be lucrative.\n\nShashua sees robotaxis arriving before self-driving cars consumers buy at dealerships. Mobileye, which was an Israeli company before Intel bought it for $15 billion in 2017, has permission to operate driverless taxis in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, most likely by the end of 2022, and in Munich as well. Two programs in California could allow driverless rides for hire on a similar timeframe\n\nMobileye driverless car is seen at the Nasdaq Market site in New York, U.S., July 20, 2021. REUTERS/Jeenah Moon\n\nRobotaxis will come first because companies like Uber or Lyft operating fleets of vehicles will be better able to absorb the cost than individual consumers. Robotaxis may also be easier to regulate, through rules governing their use inside a fixed geography such as a city\xe2\x80\x99s boundaries. Driverless cars for consumers probably need the ability to go virtually anywhere, plus some regulatory guidance that isn\xe2\x80\x99t yet fully developed. Level 4 autonomy could add $10,000 to $15,0000 to the cost of a vehicle, though that should come down as the technology scales up.\n\nThe United States isn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily ahead on autonomous vehicles. \xe2\x80\x9cI think China and Germany are in the lead position,\xe2\x80\x9d Shashua says.

"184.txt";"b'The age of autonomous or self-driving cars is slowly creeping up on us and, with each new year that passes, semi-autonomous technology is getting better and better as we inch toward the day when human driving could be outlawed altogether. With that said, a recent report provided by Cox Automotive points out that 84-percent of people surveyed would still prefer the option of driving themselves, leaving just 16-percent of those surveyed willing to give up full control. To make matters worse, the overall acceptance of self-driving technology over the last two years has fallen by 18-percentage points. That probably, at least in part, comes thanks to recent high-profile autonomous car accidents, like the fatal accident with one of Uber\xe2\x80\x99s self-driving cars. As such, it\xe2\x80\x99s not surprising that automakers are scrambling to prove that their autonomous technology is safe \xe2\x80\x93 we can always trust them, right?\n\nIn the video you see below, BMW has chosen one of its autonomous test vehicles with the co-star being none other than a scary-looking ghost in the woods. Naturally, the self-driving car stops in the middle of the road, long before it could run over the scary ghost because, you know, self-driving technology is just that good. As the video proceeds, the ghost opens the car door to find nobody in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat, gets scared, and scurries off into the woods like a very naughty mouse that was caught in your kitchen cupboard. Then we see the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cNOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF\xe2\x80\x9d flash across the screen.\n\nThis video can be seen in one of two ways. The way BMW wants you to see it is that its self-driving technology is so good that it can even stop for a lifeless entity in the middle of a dark wooded road in the middle of the night \xe2\x80\x93 a place where no car (or driver for that matter) really has any business being anyway. That\xe2\x80\x99s great- BMW\xe2\x80\x99s self-driving tech will stop for anything.

Anyway, YAY; it is super safe.\n\nI, on the other hand, look at this video a completely different way. First off, why was this self-driving car in the middle of the darkest, creepiest looking wooded road in the middle of the night? Maybe the car had gone rogue after the passenger stopped to take a leak. A brave soul that would have been. But, I digress. I think the real message here is that even ghosts \xe2\x80\x93 the leftover souls of those that once walked this earth \xe2\x80\x93 are scared of self-driving technology. Now, that, my friends, is something to take note of. If a creepy ghost walking down a dark road in the middle of the night, with clear intentions of scaring the hell out of someone, is scared of self-driving cars, then shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we be scared of them as well?

REUTERS/ Stephen Lam\n\nWASHINGTON, June 16 (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Commerce Committee on Wednesday again rejected attempts to lift regulations to allow for the deployment of thousands of autonomous vehicles as union groups and attorneys campaign against the legislative proposal.\n\nThe committee rebuffed the bid by Republican Senator John Thune to attach measures lifting regulations on autonomous vehicles to a $78 billion surface transportation bill after he sought last month to attach it in May to a bill on China tech policy.\n\nThune has proposed granting the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) the power to grant exemptions for tens of thousands of self-driving vehicles per manufacturer from safety standards written with human drivers in mind.\n\nThe surface bill, which would boost funding for Amtrak and other transportation needs, was approved by the committee on a 25-3 vote.\n\nThune and other lawmakers have sought for nearly five years to win approval.\n\nThe senator argued autonomous vehicles could help eliminate numerous deaths due to human error like distracted or impaired drivers.\n\nCommerce Committee Chair Maria Cantwell, a Democrat, cited recent Tesla crashes and other recent incidents involving driver assistance systems in her response.\n\n""It seems like every other week we\'re hearing about a new vehicle that crashed when it was on Autopilot"" Cantwell said.

"187.txt";"b'TOKYO -- Prices of one key type of the sensors used in autonomous cars are falling rapidly, raising hopes of accelerating progress in the development of self-driving technology.\n\nVelodyne Lidar, the leading manufacturer of lidar sensors, has developed a product with a price only one-hundredth of those up until now. This dramatic drop in price for the sensors at the heart of many autonomous car designs could rev up the speed of the evolution of self-driving vehicles.\n\nMost of today\'s autonomous vehicles are equipped with two key types of sensors: cameras and radars.\n\nSensors using lidar (light detection and ranging) work like radar systems, with the only difference being that they use laser light instead of radio waves.\n\nLidar technology uses near-infrared light to detect objects around a vehicle. The advantage of lidar is that it can generate precise three-dimensional images of everything from cars to traffic lights to pedestrians in a wide range of environments and under diverse lighting conditions.\n\nHonda Motor\'s new self-driving Legend luxury sedan, equipped with the world\'s first certified Level 3 autonomous driving technology, uses lidar sensors.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk, however, has famously disparaged lidar sensors, saying in 2019 that they are ""expensive sensors that are unnecessary"" and likening them to ""a whole bunch of expensive appendices.""\n\nMusk has shown such distaste for lidar technology mainly because lidar sensors have been so costly, with a system for one vehicle costing as much as $70,000. He has argued that sophisticated cameras are sufficient for self-driving cars\' vision systems.\n\nIndeed, the biggest hurdle to widespread lidar adoption has been an economic one.\n\nBut technological innovation has significantly undermined the assumption underlying Musk\'s argument.\n\nVelodyne CEO Anand Gopalan told Nikkei that Musk\'s view of lidar technology is ""five, six years out of date.""\n\nGopalan asked whether it is wise to rely on just one component for safety. ""If you\'re driving at 70 miles per hour, or 100 kilometers per hour, you\'re taking your hand off the steering wheel and you\'re shutting your brain off ... can you rely on just one sensor?"" he said.\n\nAs the costs of lidar sensors decline, they can be combined with cameras to create truly safe and affordable vision systems, he asserted. ""If lidar can become small and low-cost, [it will help] create a safe system.""\n\nMany major carmakers have apparently agreed. Velodyne\'s customer list includes Volkswagen and Honda.\n\nVelodyne CEO Anand Gopalan holds the company\'s new palm-size lidar unit.\n\nWhen Google initially started its autonomous vehicle research, it used custom-made lidar sensors from Velodyne. They were rotating models mounted on the roof.\n\nVelodyne has sharply reduced lidar production costs by developing solid-state lidars. This new approach has helped shrink the size of the sensors, eliminate moving parts in the optical mechanisms and enable the kind of mass manufacturing that has brought costs down.\n\nThe company\'s new model, its smallest so far, could be sold at around $100 in high-volume production. A sensor system composed of multiple lidars is capable of 360-degree vehicle coverage.\n\nAs the costs of making lidars fall further through mass production, the total cost of lidars per vehicle will likely fall sharply. ""Past 2025, I think you will see the cost of lidars come down even more, in the $700 range"" per vehicle, Gopalan said.\n\nLuminar Technologies, a U.S. vehicle sensor and software startup, has also developed low-priced lidar sensors priced at $500 to $1,000.\n\nLuminar\'s high-performance lidar sensors can accurately detect objects ahead of the car out to 250 meters away and grasp the situation around the vehicle with a perception accuracy of several centimeters. The sensors can also detect dark objects, like black debris or a person wearing black clothes, even on roads with minimum reflectivity.\n\nGermany\'s Daimler, Sweden\'s Volvo Cars, the Israel-based Intel unit Mobileye and Toyota Motor\'s research arm have adopted Luminar\'s lidar sensors for their self-driving prototypes.\n\nLuminar CEO Austin Russell stresses the crucial importance of focusing on safety in developing self-driving technologies. One accident per 100 people is not acceptable, Russell told Nikkei. The goal should be ""to have 99.99999999% -- 10 nines of reliability,"" he said.\n\nRussell was a child prodigy who memorized the whole periodic table at age 2 and made a cellphone on his own while he was an elementary school student. He obtained a patent for a water recycling system he invented when he was 13.\n\nUnder the guidance of billionaire Peter Thiel, a co-founder of PayPal, Russell founded Luminar at the age of 17. Following Luminar\'s listing on Nasdaq in December 2020 through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) -- a shell company that uses the proceeds from an IPO to acquire a private company -- he became a billionaire at age 25.\n\nBesides Luminar, more than five other U.S. lidar startups, including California-based Aeva, have gone public via a SPAC merger.\n\nIn recent years, progress in autonomous driving technology has been markedly slower than that for electric vehicles. One reason has been a rush of major automakers to expand their EV offerings in response to a global trend toward stricter regulatory restrictions on gasoline-powered cars aimed at reducing carbon emissions.\n\nAs their earnings have been battered by the COVID-19 pandemic, carmakers have concentrated their investment on electric vehicles while cutting their R&D spending on self-driving technology.\n\nThe walls of national regulations and high costs have also hampered the advancement of autonomous driving technology. But growing competition among Velodyne and its rivals to develop more accurate and less expensive lidar sensors could help the technology overcome these challenges and come into widespread use.\n\n""Various parts with falling prices, such as sensors and cameras, will help remedy shortcomings [of autonomous driving],"" said professor Toshio Ito at the Shibaura Institute of Technology, an expert in advanced driver assistance systems.\n\nA small number of players, mainly U.S. and Chinese tech companies, are dominating the self-driving business landscape due primarily to its high technological and financial hurdles.\n\nGeneral Motors\' autonomous driving subsidiary, GM Cruise; Waymo, which began as Google\'s self-driving car project; and China\'s Baidu are leading the pack in terms of testing self-driving cars on public roads in California and other parts of the U.S. They have covered far more distance than Daimler or Toyota.\n\nIn a notable strategic move by another tech giant, Amazon acquired the autonomous vehicle startup Zoox to develop driverless delivery vehicles.\n\nApple is another tech powerhouse that is raising its self-driving profile. Since 2017, the Palo Alto, California-based company has been test-driving its own models on public roads around its headquarters. According to documents the company submitted in the past to the state authority, Apple has been testing a Lexus-based self-driving vehicle. A Lexus equipped with self-driving systems provided by DeepRoute.ai, a Chinese company, has been spotted in the area.\n\nVelodyne\'s Gopalan welcomes entries by tech companies like those affiliated with Google\'s parent, Alphabet, and Apple into the mobility sector.\n\n""Their appetite to adopt new technologies like lidar ... is much faster than a traditional automotive [manufacturer]. And so their entry into the space has really forced the rest of the industry to innovate,"" he said.\n\nThese U.S. and Chinese tech companies, armed with not just accumulated test-driving data but also ample financial and human resources, are likely to remain on the leading edge of the self-driving revolution.'";"Autonomous Cars";"187.txt-Autonomous Cars"

Deploying autonomous vehicle technology in real-world environments is one way Arlington has demonstrated its leadership on this issue.\n\nArlington RAPID Program\n\nThe City of Arlington was recently awarded a $1.7 million grant through the Federal Transit Administration\xe2\x80\x99s Integrated Mobility Innovation Program to integrate a fleet of five autonomous vehicles into its Via on-demand rideshare service. This one-year pilot program, called Arlington RAPID (Rideshare, Automation, and Payment Integration Demonstration), is set to begin in March 2021. The City will work with Via, May Mobility, and the University of Texas at Arlington to implement this AV service in an area around Arlington\xe2\x80\x99s Downtown and on UTA\xe2\x80\x99s campus. The autonomous fleet will include a wheelchair-accessible vehicle, and the program will provide a limited number of free rides to UTA students. Click here for more information about the RAPID program.\n\nPrevious Autonomous Vehicle Projects\n\nIn October 2018, Arlington became the first Texas city to offer an on-street driverless transportation option to the general public with partner Drive.ai. The company\xe2\x80\x99s vehicles operated on streets within Arlington's world-class Entertainment District, using an on-demand system to connect passengers with employment centers, restaurants, entertainment venues, and public recreational spaces. After conducting over 760 trips and logging more than 440 miles in autonomous mode, the successful pilot program concluded in May 2019. According to a survey of riders, 98 percent said they felt safe and 91 percent said they thought their ride was smooth.\n\nThis type of innovative transportation technology isn't new for The American Dream City. In 2017, Arlington became the first city in the United States to offer continuous autonomous shuttle service to the public, with the Milo pilot program. Using EasyMile autonomous vehicles, this program operated off-street in the Entertainment District, connecting passengers from parking areas to Arlington\xe2\x80\x99s entertainment venues. The program served over 110 events, and 99% of surveyed riders reported feeling safe and enjoying their ride on Milo.

Many hope that AI will transform our economy in ways that drive growth, similar to how steam engines did in the late 19th century and electricity did in the early 20th century. But it is hard to imagine that maps on smart phones, chatbots, and other existing AI-enabled services will drive the type of economic growth we saw from stream and electricity. What we need to see are some dramatic new AI-enabled products and services that transform our way of life\xe2\x80\x94in short, we are waiting for an AI \xe2\x80\x9ckiller app.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRobert Seamans Associate Professor and Director of the Center for the Future of Management - Stern School of Business, NYU\n\nAutonomous vehicles (AVs)\xe2\x80\x94vehicles that accelerate, brake, and turn on their own, requiring little or no input from a human driver\xe2\x80\x94may be such a killer app that transforms our economy significantly. AI supports AVs in a variety of ways, including quickly processing and interpreting the large amounts of data generated by the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s cameras and sensors and helping to improve vehicle fuel efficiency and safety. The impacts of broad adoption of AVs are equally numerous, from potentially lowering transportation costs by limiting the need for drivers to possibly transforming mobility in urban and suburban environments. While the relative timing and scale of economic growth is not yet clear\xe2\x80\x94and subject to some debate among scholars\xe2\x80\x94a key step in maximizing the benefits of AVs is passing federal legislation, rather than relying on a patchwork of state and local guidelines. To inform the debate and help prepare policymakers for the task at hand, this report will examine the state of AVs, the potential for them to become a \xe2\x80\x9ckiller app\xe2\x80\x9d with broad impacts, and the existing and potential regulations that could ensure net positive effects on the economy and society as a whole.\n\nThe current state and future of AVs\n\nThe current standards for autonomous driving were developed by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE International). According to the SAE standard, the automation capability of vehicles ranges from Level 0, with no autonomy, to Level 5, which is full automation. Level 1 features include park assist, lane assist and adaptive cruise control. Some Level 3 vehicles, which include full self-driving capabilities but require human intervention in complex situations such as traffic jams, may be commercially available in 2021. No Level 4 or 5 cars, which would not require any human intervention, are yet certified for use on regular roads, though there are some such as Google\xe2\x80\x99s Waymo that are in development.\n\nWhile the potential impacts of AVs are substantial, it will take time for them to be realized; AVs are still some years from being commercially available, let alone in widespread use. To give a reasonable sense of timing, Chris Urmson\xe2\x80\x94a DARPA challenge winner, head of Google\xe2\x80\x99s Waymo autonomous vehicle unit for many years, and now CEO of a self-driving vehicle software company named Aurora \xe2\x80\x94argues it may take up to 30 to 50 years before widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles. Despite predictions to the contrary\xe2\x80\x94e.g., Elon Musk\xe2\x80\x99s 2019 prediction that there would be a Tesla driverless taxi fleet in some regions by 2020\xe2\x80\x94time frames of this magnitude are common in the automobile industry. Choe, Oettl and Seamans (2021) report that widespread adoption of new innovations in the automobile sector historically can take several decades.1 There are a number of factors that contribute to technology adoption, and even if a new technology is feasible, it may not be available at a price point that many consumers will pay. For example, turbo-charged engines, which help to reduce the amount of fuel needed, did not start to become popular until oil prices started to rise in the 1970s.\n\nIn short, the timing of adoption of AVs and the economic impacts that will follow depend on many factors. For regulators and policymakers interested in shaping what will likely be considerable economic and societal impacts of AVs, now is the time.\n\nEffect on our economy and society\n\nSupporters of autonomous vehicles argue that they may provide a variety of benefits including fuel efficiency and safety. Indeed, the Brookings Institution recently published a book on the topic (Winston and Karpilow, 2020).2 The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) argues that AVs are more fuel efficient than human-driven cars, which means fewer emissions. However, AVs may increase vehicle traffic, potentially nullifying emissions reduction from fuel efficiency. Kroger, Kuhnimhof, and Trommer (2019) project the adoption of autonomous vehicle technologies may increase vehicle traffic by 2-9 percent as a result of new automobile user groups as well as lower generalized costs of car travel.3\n\nAVs will likely be safer than human-driven cars, in large part through reducing human error which the National Highway Traffic Safety Association (NHTSA) estimates accounts for 94 percent of crashes. While widespread adoption of AVs should ultimately result in safer roads, there have been several high profile accidents involving AVs, such as a Waymo van that crashed into a car in Arizona. Perhaps as a result of some of these high-profile accidents, consumer demand for AVs seems to be relatively low. According to a 2021 survey by the American Automobile Association, only 14 percent of drivers report that they would trust riding in a vehicle that drives itself, a response similar to the 2020 survey. It is possible, however, that consumer attitudes will change once Level 4 and 5 vehicles become commercially available.\n\nAVs may help to reduce labor input costs in driving-intensive industries. However, as Gittleman and Monaco (2017) point out, there are several types of drivers, and autonomous driving will likely affect some types more than others.4 Autonomous vehicles are more likely to be used for heavy and tractor trailer truck purposes (aka \xe2\x80\x9clong haul\xe2\x80\x9d) than local delivery given the relative ease of navigating on highways and all the other tasks associated with local delivery, including freight handling, paperwork, and customer service. Gittleman and Monaco estimate that Level 4 and 5 automation may ultimately displace 300,000 to 400,000 drivers. But the authors highlight that there are many practical limitations to automation. For example, they highlight that one of the important functions of a truck driver is to serve as a security guard for the freight.\n\nA recent paper by Gelauff, Ossokina, and Teulings (2019) envisions some of the longer-term outcomes from AVs.5 The authors model two countervailing effects from AVs, each of which lead to differing outcomes on population distribution. On one hand, AVs may lead to improved use of time during car trips, which lowers the cost of living at a distance from cities. On the other hand, AVs may lead to improved public transit options in urban environments in the form of shared-ride autonomous vehicles (SAVs). The authors argue that SAVs may be more efficient than existing public transit and may make city living relatively more attractive leading to more population clustering in cities. The authors argue that the second effect may outweigh the first and ultimately may lead to overall population shifts towards large, attractive cities at the expense of smaller urban and non-urban areas. While the authors don\xe2\x80\x99t speculate on the ultimate economic effects of such a change, it is worth noting that literature from economic geography suggests that there are many agglomeration effects from living in or close to cities, including greater economic growth and innovation.6 It is also worth noting that the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a large shift in population away from many urban environments, at least in the short run.\n\nIn short, AVs will likely affect our economy and society in a variety of ways. AVs may lead to fewer emissions and increased safety. By decreasing the need for humans to drive, AVs will likely transform the type of work done by humans in the transportation sector of the economy and may also change the way that humans commute to and from work. How all this plays out, however, depends on numerous factors including, importantly, existing and future regulations.\n\nCurrent and prospective AV legislation\n\nThe National Conference of State Legislatures highlights that a number of states have introduced and enacted laws related to autonomous vehicles. Notably, in December 2020, California State Senator Ben Allen introduced a bill to establish a new Council on the Future of Transportation in California that would promote state legislation for autonomous vehicles, in addition to other transportation-related policy. Also, in November 2020 the California Public Utilities Commission approved autonomous vehicle regulatory framework that would make it easier for companies to provide autonomous vehicle transportation services to the public. While these laws indicate that state legislators are responsive to local concerns about autonomous vehicles, the risk is a resulting patchwork of state laws.\n\nWith this concern in mind, there have been attempts at federal legislation, notably in 2017 with the SELF DRIVE Act in the House and the AV START Act in the Senate. The SELF DRIVE Act (Safely Ensuring Lives Future Deployment and Research In Vehicle Evolution Act) was passed in the House in 2017 but did not advance in the Senate. The bill would have provided NHTSA with the authority to regulate AVs. NHTSA would be authorized to require safety assessment certifications and states would be preempted from enacting laws regarding the design, construction, or performance of AVs unless those laws enact standards identical to federal standards. In addition, the bill would have required that manufacturers of AVs develop written cybersecurity and privacy plans for such vehicles prior to offering them for sale. The AV START Act (American Vision for Safer Transportation through Advancement of Revolutionary Technologies Act) was introduced in the Senate in 2017 but did not advance. Like the SELF DRIVE Act, it would have established a framework for a federal role in oversight of AVs, preempting state laws and providing clarity to stakeholders including car manufacturers and insurance companies.\n\nIt remains to be seen when federal legislation on AVs will be passed, although there are promising signs. Reportedly, there is currently bipartisan support for federal legislation, notably from Republican Senator John Thune and Democratic Senator Gary Peters (who were co-sponsors of the AV START Act). While the Biden administration did not mention autonomous vehicles in its recently proposed infrastructure and jobs plan (instead focusing on electric vehicles and charging stations), Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has stated, \xe2\x80\x9cAutomated vehicle technology is coming, it\xe2\x80\x99s advancing very quickly, it is something that holds the potential to be transformative, and I think in many ways policy has not kept up.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nExisting regulatory barriers: Spectrum\n\nOne important issue to be resolved is around communication standards between autonomous vehicles. The 5.9 GHz spectrum, a 75 MHz band, had initially been set aside for use for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications in 1999, and NHTSA, car manufacturers, and device manufacturers spent the ensuing two decades working on a standard for V2V communications. However, the standard that emerged, called Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC), continues to face considerable resistance, including from a competing standard called Cellular-Vehicle-to-Vehicle (C-V2V). DSRC allows direct communication between two DSRC-enabled devices without relying on an intermediary, such as a cellular network, which in principle makes it fast and deployable in areas without cellular coverage. However, research by Gyawali et al (2020) suggests that DSRC only works well when two vehicles are in sight of each other and not moving too fast.7 C-V2V operates through a cellular network, which may limit its ability to function well in remote areas but handles communications between vehicles that are moving quickly (Gyawali et al 2020).\n\nSeparately, Wi-Fi demands have been growing, and the 5.9 GHz spectrum is increasingly being used for unlicensed Wi-Fi. A 2018 study by Rand Corporation estimated that the value of the consumer and producer surplus from using the entire band for Wi-Fi to be between $82.2 billion and $189.9 billion. In November 2019 Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Ajit Pai announced a plan whereby 45 MHz at the lower end of the band will be made available for Wi-Fi, the next 20 MHz for C-V2V, and the top 10 MHz potentially for C-V2V or DSRC. In November 2020 the FCC voted in favor of the proposal, despite objections by the Trump administration\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Transportation. There are calls for the Biden administration to reverse the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s decision. The plan would seem to bolster the C-V2V standard relative to DSRC, which may hasten resolution of the standards battle, and also favors use of Wi-Fi over transportation. It will be important for policymakers to consider the tradeoffs associated with use of the spectrum. On the one hand, demand for spectrum for Wi-Fi enabled devices is a growing and current need. In contrast, there is currently little need for spectrum for autonomous vehicles\xe2\x80\x94there aren\xe2\x80\x99t any commercially available and consumer demand seems low. On the other hand, spectrum for autonomous vehicles will likely be a future need, and the economic benefits of autonomous vehicles may outweigh the benefits of additional Wi-Fi.\n\nConclusion\n\nAutonomous vehicles will likely transform our economy, including changing the role of humans in transportation-related industries and potentially reducing emissions and increasing safety, all of which should ultimately lead to economic growth. However, large-scale adoption of autonomous vehicles and the ensuing economic growth will likely take time. The technology is still in development and consumers remain wary of autonomous vehicles. Moreover, federal and state legislation is still nascent, and there are competing standards for communication between vehicles. All of this needs to be resolved before AVs can become a \xe2\x80\x9ckiller app.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEditor\xe2\x80\x99s Note: This paper was updated from a previous version to reflect a change in Tesla vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s SAE automation level from 3 to 2.\n\nThe authors did not receive financial support from any firm or person for this article or from any firm or person with a financial or political interest in this article.

In limited geographical areas, individuals can sometimes be passengers in these vehicles. However, mastering the technology behind these cars has proven highly costly, and a wider rollout has taken much longer than expected.\n\nEven Tesla, who offers an \xe2\x80\x9cAutopilot\xe2\x80\x9d feature and boasts that their cars can run by themselves, admits (sometimes) that there needs to be a human at the controls. This is partly because of the accidents that continue to occur when people allow the car to do what it promises to do: drive itself. Clearly, safety continues to be a significant concern.\n\nIn April of this year, a Tesla vehicle was involved in a fatal crash that killed two people. Just before the drive, eyewitnesses said that the parties left to test-drive the vehicle without a driver utilizing Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s Autopilot feature.\n\nTesla claims the accident occurred because there was no one behind the wheel. The company says they include a warning on when and where to use this feature in the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s manual. They also state on their website that active driver supervision is required, yet they continue to advertise the Autopilot feature as autonomous.\n\nSo, before we examine who\xe2\x80\x99s at fault if you\xe2\x80\x99re involved in an accident with a driverless car, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand the complexities surrounding self-driving cars, from what defines the term to current regulations and the latest developments in the industry.\n\nWHAT ARE SELF-DRIVING VEHICLES?\n\nThe terms \xe2\x80\x9cself-driving,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdriverless,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cautonomous\xe2\x80\x9d are often used synonymously, although there are important distinctions.\n\nSelf-driving vehicles have been assigned levels of autonomy by the NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration). Most cars on the road today operate at Level 1, where there are some autonomous functions such as cruise control or Lane-Keep Assist. It\xe2\x80\x99s worth noting that the NHTSA recently updated their descriptions of Levels 4 and 5 to include a greater degree of autonomy and lack of human intervention.\n\nThere has been some reluctance for people to grab onto the self-driving concept. However, according to forecaster Scott Hardman, as driving becomes more automated, people will drive more, based on his interviews with 35 Tesla BEV with Autopilot owners. Those interviewed perceived less stress and increased comfort associated with partial automation.\n\nIn the meantime, technology is moving forward amidst hope, some trepidation, and, most of all, confusion.\n\nESSENTIAL SELF-DRIVING VEHICLE STATS\n\nExact statistics about driverless vehicles are difficult to get due to the lack of mandates on reporting accidents and the lack of industry-wide standards, where confusion abounds. Nevertheless, here are some important numbers worth considering:\n\nMore than 80 companies are testing over 1,400 self-driving cars in the U.S.\n\nAbout half of the population familiar with self-driving cars say they would be willing to ride in them.\n\nThe Tsukuba Mechanical Engineering Laboratory in Japan launched the first primitive, semi-automated car in 1977.\n\nGoogle\xe2\x80\x99s self-driving car first crashed into a bus in February of 2016; there were no injuries.\n\nTesla autonomous vehicles have been involved in several accidents. The first accident that resulted in death occurred in Florida on May 7, 2016.\n\nThe first Uber self-driving car crash occurred on November 20, 2018, in Tempe, Arizona. The cause was human error and resulted in the death of pedestrian Elaine Hezerberg.\n\nUber was involved in 37 crashes prior to the fatal accident in 2018.\n\nWaymo, the self-driving division of Google parent company Alphabet, Inc., partnered with the trucking giant J.B. Hunt and began hauling commercial loads on Texas highways with Level 4 autonomous big-rig vehicles in March of 2020.\n\nWaymo has also been running a driverless taxi service in the Phoenix, Arizona area since 2018. In May of this year, one of these Waymo taxis got confused in Chandler, Arizona traffic and took off on its own. Fortunately, no one was injured.\n\nLyft predicts autonomous rides could arrive by 2023.\n\nMany experts say driverless cars are safer than those driven entirely by human operators. Regardless, accidents have occurred and will continue to take place for many reasons. But if you\xe2\x80\x99re involved in a driverless car accident, who\xe2\x80\x99s at fault? Do you have any recourse?\n\nWHO\xe2\x80\x99S TO BLAME IN A CRASH?\n\nThe blame, or cause, of the accident, can be murky at best and may rest with more than one party. That\xe2\x80\x99s why it is essential to have a professional and experienced personal injury attorney on your side to accurately assess the situation, interpret the data, and consult the right experts to support your case and present it properly to the court.\n\nWHAT TO DO IF YOU\xe2\x80\x99RE IN AN ACCIDENT WITH A DRIVERLESS CAR\n\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re involved in an accident of any kind, you\xe2\x80\x99ll want to seek medical help as soon as possible. Often physical, mental, or emotional trauma doesn\xe2\x80\x99t show up right away, even if you think you weren\xe2\x80\x99t hurt.\n\nBe sure to:'";"Autonomous Cars";"191.txt-Autonomous Cars"

This situation highlights the difficulties facing the automated vehicle industry, which has gotten billions of dollars in investor money over the past decade.\n\nIn the past year, self-driving startups like Cruise and Pony.ai have begun testing their driverless cars in some parts of California. These cars have human operators.\n\nThe human is not \xe2\x80\x9cdriving,\xe2\x80\x9d but sitting in the passenger seat. Called a safety operator, the human ""has a red button that can stop the vehicle just in case anything happens,"" Pony.ai CEO James Peng told the Reuters news agency.\n\nThe operator will be removed next year when Pony.ai, whose investors include Toyota Motor Corp., sends out its driverless vehicles in some areas of California. Still, an operator will supervise vehicles from a distance and give help when the vehicles run into trouble, Peng said.\n\nCruise is majority-owned by General Motors. It started operating five driverless vehicles in San Francisco at night in October 2020. A human was in the front seat. The person has ""the ability to stop the vehicle at any point during the ride,"" a Cruise spokesman told Reuters.\n\n""Cruise views the development of self-driving vehicles as not only a tech race, but also a trust race,\xe2\x80\x9d the spokesman said.

"193.txt";"b'Last summer, I asked (with a hint of frustration) where my totally self-driving car was. After all, it was 2020, and I had accumulated a slew of statements from years past that promised millions of them would be on the road by then.\n\nNow, we\xe2\x80\x99re well into 2021, and I\xe2\x80\x99m starting to get discouraged.\n\nFirst, Christopher Mims of The Wall Street Journal reported a few weeks ago that some experts now say, despite an accumulated investment of more than $80 billion toward research and technology, that \xe2\x80\x9cwe may never get the self-driving cars we were promised.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThen, I spoke to an expert I\xe2\x80\x99ve known for years, who told me basically the same thing.\n\nActually, that\xe2\x80\x99s not entirely true. Francesco Biondi did tell me we might see such a car, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I think it will probably be toward the end of my lifetime.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe is 33. I don\xe2\x80\x99t stand a chance.\n\nAll those dreams I had of a car that would take me to doctor appointments in my old age, drop me off at the door, park itself, then come get me when I was done? Poof! Up in smoke, like so many semi-autonomous cars that run into things.\n\nBiondi used to be an assistant professor at the University of Utah, where he conducted tests on volunteers who drove back and forth to Wendover in semi-autonomous cars. They drove one way manually and let the car handle much of the driving in the other direction. They wore contraptions that measured brain waves and had video recorders trained on them, which eventually demonstrated that people tend to lose focus when their cars automatically stay in their lanes and brake for traffic ahead.\n\nWhich is a problem, because those cars aren\xe2\x80\x99t really ready to drive themselves.\n\nIn other words, it\xe2\x80\x99s more dangerous to drive today\xe2\x80\x99s semi-autonomous cars than to pilot that old, dusty beater that requires you to do everything \xe2\x80\x94 brake, accelerate, turn, switch on the radio and watch out for the other guy \xe2\x80\x94 all by yourself.\n\nIf your beater has a manual transmission, you don\xe2\x80\x99t even have a hand free to text while driving.\n\nRelated Legislature approves bill allowing driverless cars on Utah roads\n\nToday, Biondi is a fully tenured assistant professor at the University of Windsor, in Canada. His window lets him look across the river toward Detroit, which once was the symbol of America\xe2\x80\x99s booming automobile industry. He\xe2\x80\x99s still very much involved in similar research.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think that the industry assumed it would be much easier,\xe2\x80\x9d he said about self-driving cars. The reason they were wrong is something that ought to make all of us feel proud:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs much as we like to think that humans are not as smart as machines \xe2\x80\xa6 that\xe2\x80\x99s far from being the case. Even after years of testing, autonomous cars are unable to match the human driver\xe2\x80\x99s performances. There are a lot of scenarios \xe2\x80\x94 weather conditions, road conditions \xe2\x80\x94 where these cars are not as smart as we want them to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSo, rogue machines aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to take over the world any time soon. That\xe2\x80\x99s good news, even though it won\xe2\x80\x99t help me get to the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s office as an old man.\n\nAnd yet that message doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be widespread knowledge. At least, that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the case last April in Texas when two men decided to go for a ride in a Tesla, with one apparently in the back seat and the other in the front passenger seat \xe2\x80\x94 and no one behind the wheel.\n\nThe New York Times said their wives overheard the men talking about the car\xe2\x80\x99s autopilot features as they left. They died when the car left the road on a steep turn.\n\nBiondi said evidence shows many people who buy semi-autonomous cars overestimate what they can do. Dealerships sometimes oversell the products or leave out information about limitations.\n\nMims, of The Wall Street Journal, suggests some experts think the whole idea needs to be rethought. They want to approach the necessary artificial intelligence by building systems that learn the way human babies do. Others want to divide the problem into smaller chunks, developing systems that each handle a piece of the puzzle.\n\nBiondi said he thinks commercial trucking shows more promise at the moment, especially if it involves dedicating lanes of traffic for that use only.\n\nTo me, it all sounds long and laborious and so \xe2\x80\xa6 well \xe2\x80\xa6 20th century.\n\nIt also sounds like I\xe2\x80\x99d better be prepared for that day when, as with my Dad and those before him, the kids discreetly take my keys from me and, in my decrepit state, I have to bum a ride to the doctor.

But just as with cruise control, it soon feels commonplace.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been covering autonomous driving for several years so I\xe2\x80\x99ve taken lots of these rides \xe2\x80\x94 often carefully choreographed to show the cars to best advantage.\n\nFive years ago, I perched nervously in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat of a self-driving Uber Ford Fusion in Pittsburgh, ready to take the wheel as it crisscrossed the city\xe2\x80\x99s notorious bridges. I chugged around the campus of Santa Clara University in a converted golf cart from Auro Robotics, and barreled down Interstate 280 in a self-driving big rig from Otto. Alongside Zoox co-founder Jesse Levinson, who narrated the trip like a proud parent, I wound through narrow San Francisco streets in 2018. Scientists at Stanford University, UC Berkeley and Nissan Research Center told me how they are facilitating communication between robot cars and humans.\n\nWednesday\xe2\x80\x99s jaunt in Waymo\xe2\x80\x99s self-driving Jaguar I-Pace had no surprises. The car smoothly glided to a stop at intersections and signaled before turns. The closest thing to a hiccup was a slight jerkiness when it pulled over to drop off us faux ride-hailing passengers. The company confined our 20-minute test drive to the wide, relatively empty streets of the Sunset District, avoiding the hills and traffic elsewhere in the city, so the car didn\xe2\x80\x99t face any challenges. Ever Guardado, our safety driver, never needed to assume control, but did so once at my request just to demonstrate the tones the car sounds when a driver takes over.\n\nFour years ago when I rode in an earlier-generation Waymo robot car at its testing site on a former military base in Merced County, Waymo staged several complex situations: a bicyclist pedaling alongside, a pedestrian wandering into the crosswalk, a car abruptly cutting off the robot car and boxes sprawling into the road. That robot car, which did not have a person behind the wheel, adapted quickly to all the tests thrown at it.\n\nWaymo, an arm of Google parent Alphabet, now has the distinction of running San Francisco\xe2\x80\x99s first robot taxi service for the public, albeit with backup drivers behind the wheel and limits on how many folks it will accept into its testing program.\n\nJessica Christian/The Chronicle\n\nFleets of robot taxis are how Waymo, Cruise, Zoox and other main contenders in the self-driving race hope to eventually recoup their investors\xe2\x80\x99 multibillion-dollar investments.\n\nWhy test robot taxis in San Francisco?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a major ride-hailing market with a lot of demand from residents,\xe2\x80\x9d said spokesperson Julianne McGoldrick. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the toughest environments for driving \xe2\x80\x94 weather, traffic, road grade, cyclists.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn other words, if a robot car can make it here, it can make it anywhere. That\xe2\x80\x99s also the philosophy of several of Waymo\xe2\x80\x99s competitors, notably GM spin-off Cruise, whose white Chevy Bolts are a common sight on city streets.\n\nWaymo is far along on robot taxis in Phoenix, a much easier city to navigate. It\xe2\x80\x99s given rides to selected testers since 2017, jettisoned the backup drivers since 2019 and now, for almost a year, has been giving hundreds of fully autonomous paid rides \xe2\x80\x94 sans backup driver \xe2\x80\x94 every week to any member of the public who summons one via the Waymo One app, which works pretty much like any other ride-hailing app.\n\nEven when there\xe2\x80\x99s no driver in the car, Waymo has operations specialists who monitor the rides via cameras on the dashboard and the back seat. At a ride\xe2\x80\x99s onset, they check that passengers are buckled up and haven\xe2\x80\x99t brought more than three people along. Riders can talk to them by pressing a button on the app or on a console in the back seat.\n\nJessica Christian/The Chronicle\n\nFor now San Francisco rides are free \xe2\x80\x94 Waymo doesn\xe2\x80\x99t yet have permission to charge a fee. And although it\xe2\x80\x99s had permission since 2018 to ditch backup drivers in California, it has not yet done so. Rival Cruise has been testing some cars without backup drivers in San Francisco for nine months.\n\nBut McGoldrick said its trajectory here to fully autonomous paid rides will be quicker than that in Phoenix.\n\nBack in 2016, lots of smart people said fully autonomous cars would be ubiquitous by 2020. AI researchers told me that their then-toddler-aged kids would never get driver\xe2\x80\x99s licenses.\n\nBut the prospect of robot cars \xe2\x80\x94 and the promise that they\xe2\x80\x99ll improve transportation, end traffic fatalities and reduce congestion \xe2\x80\x94 has stayed tantalizingly out of reach.\n\nAir Quality Tracker Check levels down to the neighborhood Ratings for the Bay Area and California, updated every 10 minutes\n\nThe technology got very far along \xe2\x80\x94 but not all the way. The public got disenchanted, especially after an Uber self-driving car struck and killed a pedestrian in 2018. Companies like Uber and Lyft sold off their self-driving units as the industry consolidated.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe low-hanging fruit in this field is some combination of slow speeds, simple environments and semi-supervised operations,\xe2\x80\x9d Bryant Walker Smith, a longtime industry observer and affiliate scholar at the Stanford Law School Center for Internet and Society, said in an email. \xe2\x80\x9cWaymo and Cruise have long been more interested in moon shots.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJessica Christian/The Chronicle\n\nThose companies need to find \xe2\x80\x9csweet spots that are both technically and financially feasible,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, noting that while Phoenix is technically much easier than the Bay Area, it\xe2\x80\x99s also much less lucrative.\n\nCurrent ride-hailing has low expenses, he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAn Uber trip is basically just a poorly paid driver in a midtier car.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut the robot car fleets, even though they eliminated the labor expenses, have to cover costs for cars that mount up to several hundred thousand dollars each, \xe2\x80\x9cas well as a vast infrastructure for remote human monitoring and support.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTV and movies are replete with far-out images of the future. But I was most struck by a low-tech image in the comedy-drama series \xe2\x80\x9cCasual.\xe2\x80\x9d The final season, which aired in 2018, purportedly took place a couple of years in the future. How the show signaled that: Lead actress Michaela Watkins arrived at her home in a ride-hailing vehicle. The camera briefly panned to show that no one was in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat.\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of naturally interwoven use of robot cars that futurists \xe2\x80\x94 and Waymo, Cruise, etc. \xe2\x80\x94 are betting on.\n\nCarolyn Said is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

You\xe2\x80\x99ll make the right adjustments in braking and accelerating, picking just the right moment to go in and out of your lane, all while carrying on a conversation with your passenger.\n\nGenerally, human drivers do relatively well with this kind of complexity. We\xe2\x80\x99re able to respond to the out-of-the-ordinary intuitively.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOn the other hand, we get bored, tired, and easily distracted. Even with all the improvements in automotive safety over the years and depressed vehicle miles traveled from the COVID-19 pandemic, an estimated 38,000 Americans died on the roads in 2020.\n\nAutonomous vehicles have long been promised as the solution, with their sensors that see far ahead in all kinds of weather and their ever-vigilant computers that follow the rules of the road with hyper focus.\n\nBut the reality is more complex. As often happens with new technologies, some challenges are harder than they seemed at first. In fact, the industry is going through a bit of a reset, with companies like Uber and Lyft selling their autonomous vehicle units.\n\nWhy is autonomy hard? The roadways are highly cluttered with many sizes and shapes of obstacles; various objects move in and out quickly and unpredictably; and human behavior is difficult for a machine to predict. Whenever people \xe2\x80\x9cact naturally\xe2\x80\x9d during an odd scenario, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good time to worry about autonomous vehicles.\n\nFor a long time, the answer appeared to be to let an autonomous vehicle do the bulk of the driving, but only with a human behind the wheel, ready to take over in case of failure. The best of both worlds, right?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nUnfortunately, no.\n\nResearch has shown that humans make poor safety drivers. By the time they gain situational awareness in an emergency, it\xe2\x80\x99s often too late to react. In fact, relying upon \xe2\x80\x9chuman fallback\xe2\x80\x9d might actually be more dangerous than fully automated systems.\n\nFurther, the approach of using virtual simulations to prove system safety is facing a harsh reality: The endlessly complex environment, coupled with constantly evolving hardware and software, means that relying upon systems to drive millions of simulated miles, while necessary, is insufficient.\n\nSo, the promise of widely deployed self-driving vehicles remains elusive.\n\nWe still think it\xe2\x80\x99s likely that highly automated vehicles, in some form and performing certain tasks, will become a reality. Where we first see these systems on the roads is uncertain: Maybe electric vehicles \xe2\x80\x94 cheaper to produce than complex gas vehicles \xe2\x80\x94 will include expensive autonomous systems; or maybe autonomous freight trucks on highways may have the right economic incentives for autonomy adoption.\n\nRegardless of which operational model succeeds, we believe there are four major steps we can take in the short term:\n\nLet autonomous vehicles communicate with one another through connected vehicle technology \xe2\x80\x94 The world is a complex place for autonomous vehicles. Weather makes it hard to virtually \xe2\x80\x9csee\xe2\x80\x9d with sensors; emergency responders alter the roadways to make accident scenes safe; and people around the vehicle are hidden by buildings and foliage. Any technology that simplifies this world is crucial to fast and safe adoption of these capabilities. Connected vehicle technology lets these systems \xe2\x80\x9ctalk\xe2\x80\x9d with each other and with the world around them, sharing information about traffic, objects, and intended vehicle paths. To make this vision a reality, industry and the government must come together to implement and standardize these communications, as well as invest in necessary infrastructure.\n\nThe world is a complex place for autonomous vehicles.

"196.txt";"b""Self-driving cars are being developed by several major technology companies and carmakers. credit: VCG/Getty\n\nWhen a driver slams on the brakes to avoid hitting a pedestrian crossing the road illegally, she is making a moral decision that shifts risk from the pedestrian to the people in the car. Self-driving cars might soon have to make such ethical judgments on their own \xe2\x80\x94 but settling on a universal moral code for the vehicles could be a thorny task, suggests a survey of 2.3 million people from around the world.\n\nThe largest ever survey of machine ethics1, published today in Nature, finds that many of the moral principles that guide a driver\xe2\x80\x99s decisions vary by country. For example, in a scenario in which some combination of pedestrians and passengers will die in a collision, people from relatively prosperous countries with strong institutions were less likely to spare a pedestrian who stepped into traffic illegally.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople who think about machine ethics make it sound like you can come up with a perfect set of rules for robots, and what we show here with data is that there are no universal rules,\xe2\x80\x9d says Iyad Rahwan, a computer scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge and a co-author of the study.\n\nThe survey, called the Moral Machine, laid out 13 scenarios in which someone\xe2\x80\x99s death was inevitable. Respondents were asked to choose who to spare in situations that involved a mix of variables: young or old, rich or poor, more people or fewer.\n\nPeople rarely encounter such stark moral dilemmas, and some critics question whether the scenarios posed in the quiz are relevant to the ethical and practical questions surrounding driverless cars. But the study\xe2\x80\x99s authors say that the scenarios stand in for the subtle moral decisions that drivers make every day. They argue that the findings reveal cultural nuances that governments and makers of self-driving cars must take into account if they want the vehicles to gain public acceptance.\n\nAt least one company working on self-driving cars \xe2\x80\x94 the German carmaker Audi \xe2\x80\x94 says that the survey could help prompt an important discussion about these issues. (Other firms with autonomous-vehicle programmes, including auto manufacturer Toyota and technology companies Waymo and Uber, declined to comment on the findings.) And Nicholas Christakis, a social scientist at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, is fascinated by the results.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a remarkable paper,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. The debate about whether ethics are universal or vary between cultures is an old one, says Christakis, and now the \xe2\x80\x9ctwenty-first century problem\xe2\x80\x9d of how to programme self-driving cars has reinvigorated it.\n\nThe road not taken\n\nSome of the world\xe2\x80\x99s biggest tech companies \xe2\x80\x94 including Google's parent, Alphabet; Uber; and Tesla \xe2\x80\x94 and carmakers now have self-driving car programmes. Many of these companies argue that the vehicles could improve road safety, ease traffic and improve fuel efficiency. Social scientists say the cars raise ethical issues, and could have unintended consequences for public safety and the environment.\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nIn 2016, Rahwan\xe2\x80\x99s team stumbled on an ethical paradox about self-driving cars2: in surveys, people said that they wanted an autonomous vehicle to protect pedestrians even if it meant sacrificing its passengers \xe2\x80\x94 but also that they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t buy self-driving vehicles programmed to act this way.\n\nCurious to see if the prospect of self-driving cars might raise other ethical condundrums, Rahwan gathered an international team of psychologists, anthropologists and economists to create the Moral Machine. Within 18 months, the online quiz had recorded 40 million decisions made by people from 233 countries and territories.\n\nNo matter their age, gender or country of residence, most people spared humans over pets, and groups of people over individuals. These responses are in line with rules proposed in what may be the only governmental guidance on self-driving cars: a 2017 report by the German Ethics Commission on Automated and Connected Driving.\n\nBut agreement ends there. When the authors analysed answers from people in the 130 countries with at least 100 respondents, they found that the nations could be divided into three groups. One contains North America and several European nations where Christianity has historically been the dominant religion; another includes countries such as Japan, Indonesia and Pakistan, with strong Confucian or Islamic traditions. A third group consists of Central and South America, as well as France and former French colonies. The first group showed a stronger preference for sacrificing older lives to save younger ones than did the second group, for example.\n\nThe researchers also identified correlations between social and economic factors in a country and the average opinions of its residents. The team found that people from countries with strong government institutions, such as Finland and Japan, more often chose to hit people who were crossing the road illegally than did respondents in nations with weaker institutions, such as Nigeria or Pakistan.\n\nScenarios that forced survey participants to choose whether to save a homeless person on one side of the road or an executive on the other revealed another point of departure: the choices people made often correlated with the level of economic inequality in their culture. People from Finland \xe2\x80\x94 which has a relatively small gap between the rich and the poor \xe2\x80\x94 showed little preference for swerving one way or the other. But the average respondent from Colombia \xe2\x80\x94 a country with significant economic disparity \xe2\x80\x94 chose to kill the lower-status person.\n\nAzim Shariff, a psychologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, finds this result interesting because it suggests that the survey really does reveal people\xe2\x80\x99s moral preferences. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you assume that places that have a lower level of income inequality have political policies that favor egalitarianism, this shows that the moral norms that support those policies are expressed in the way that people play these games.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPotholes ahead?\n\nAlthough autonomous vehicles aren't yet for sale to the public, test versions are cruising through several US cities. By 2021, at least five manufacturers hope to have self-driving cars and trucks in wide use.\n\nBryant Walker Smith, a law professor at the University of South Carolina in Columbia, is sceptical that the Moral Machine survey will have any practical use. He says that the study is unrealistic because there are few instances in real life in which a vehicle would face a choice between striking two different types of people. \xe2\x80\x9cI might as well worry about how automated cars will deal with asteroid strikes,\xe2\x80\x9d Walker Smith says.\n\nBut the study\xe2\x80\x99s authors say that their scenarios represent the minor moral judgements that human drivers make routinely \xe2\x80\x94 which can sometimes be fatal. A driver who veers away from cyclists riding on a curvy mountain road increases her chance of hitting an oncoming vehicle. If the number of driverless cars on the road increases, so too will the likelihood that they will be involved in such accidents.\n\nSome car companies are listening. Barbara Wege, who heads a group focused on autonomous-vehicle ethics at Audi in Ingolstadt, Germany, says such studies are valuable. Wege argues that self-driving cars would cause fewer accidents, proportionally, than human drivers do each year \xe2\x80\x94 but that events involving robots might receive more attention.\n\nSurveys such as the Moral Machine can help to begin public discussions about these inevitable accidents that might foster trust. \xe2\x80\x9cWe need to come up with a social consensus,\xe2\x80\x9d she says, \xe2\x80\x9cabout which risks we are willing to take.\xe2\x80\x9d""";"Autonomous Cars";"196.txt-Autonomous Cars"
"197.txt";"b""B Y THE AGE of seven months, most children have learned that objects still exist even when they are out of sight. Put a toy under a blanket and a child that old will know it is still there, and that he can reach underneath the blanket to get it back. This understanding, of \xe2\x80\x9cobject permanence\xe2\x80\x9d, is a normal developmental milestone, as well as a basic tenet of reality.\n\nListen to this story Your browser does not support the <audio> element. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.\n\nIt is also something that self-driving cars do not have. And that is a problem. Autonomous vehicles are getting better, but they still don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the world in the way that a human being does. For a self-driving car, a bicycle that is momentarily hidden by a passing van is a bicycle that has ceased to exist.\n\nThis failing is basic to the now-widespread computing discipline that has arrogated to itself the slightly misleading moniker of artificial intelligence ( AI ). Current AI works by building up complex statistical models of the world, but it lacks a deeper understanding of reality. How to give AI at least some semblance of that understanding\xe2\x80\x94the reasoning ability of a seven-month-old child, perhaps\xe2\x80\x94is now a matter of active research.\n\nModern AI is based on the idea of machine learning. If an engineer wants a computer to recognise a stop sign, he does not try to write thousands of lines of code that describe every pattern of pixels which could possibly indicate such a sign. Instead, he writes a program that can learn for itself, and then shows that program thousands of pictures of stop signs. Over many repetitions, the program gradually works out what features all of these pictures have in common.\n\nSimilar techniques are used to train self-driving cars to operate in traffic. Cars thus learn how to obey lane markings, avoid other vehicles, hit the brakes at a red light and so on. But they do not understand many things a human driver takes for granted\xe2\x80\x94that other cars on the road have engines and four wheels, or that they obey traffic regulations (usually) and the laws of physics (always). And they do not understand object permanence.\n\nIn a recent paper in Artificial Intelligence, Mehul Bhatt of Orebro University, in Sweden, who is also the founder of a firm called CoDesign Lab which is developing his ideas commercially, describes a different approach. He and his colleagues took some existing AI programs which are used by self-driving cars and bolted onto them a piece of software called a symbolic-reasoning engine.\n\nThe heart has its reasons...\n\nInstead of approaching the world probabilistically, as machine learning does, this software was programmed to apply basic physical concepts to the output of the programs that process signals from an autonomous vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s sensors. This modified output was then fed to the software which drives the vehicle. The concepts involved included the ideas that discrete objects continue to exist over time, that they have spatial relationships with one another\xe2\x80\x94such as \xe2\x80\x9cin-front-of\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbehind\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and that they can be fully or partly visible, or completely hidden by another object.\n\nAnd it worked. In tests, if one car momentarily blocked the sight of another, the reasoning-enhanced software could keep track of the blocked car, predict where and when it would reappear, and take steps to avoid it if necessary. The improvement was not huge. On standard tests Dr Bhatt\xe2\x80\x99s system scored about 5% better than existing software. But it proved the principle. And it also yielded something else. For, unlike a machine-learning algorithm, a reasoning engine can tell you the reason why it did what it did.\n\nYou could, for instance, ask a car fitted with a reasoning engine why it had hit the brakes, and it would be able to tell you that it thought a bicycle hidden by a van was about to enter the intersection ahead. A machine-learning program cannot do that. Besides helping improve program design, such information will, Dr Bhatt reckons, help regulators and insurance companies. It may thus speed up public acceptance of autonomous vehicles.\n\nDr Bhatt\xe2\x80\x99s work is part of a long-standing debate in the field of artificial intelligence. Early AI researchers, working in the 1950s, chalked up some successes using this sort of preprogrammed reasoning. But, beginning in the 1990s, machine learning improved dramatically, thanks to better programming techniques combined with more powerful computers and the availability of more data. Today almost all AI is based on it.\n\nDr Bhatt is not, though, alone in his scepticism. Gary Marcus, who studies psychology and neural science at New York University and is also the boss of an AI and robotics company called Robust. AI , agrees. To support his point of view, Dr Marcus cites a much-publicised result, albeit from eight years ago. This was when engineers at DeepMind (then an independent company, now part of Google) wrote a program that could learn, without being given any hints about the rules, how to play Breakout, a video game which involves hitting a moving virtual ball with a virtual paddle.\n\nDeepMind\xe2\x80\x99s program was a great player. But when another group of researchers tinkered with Breakout\xe2\x80\x99s code\xe2\x80\x94shifting the location of the paddles by just a few pixels\xe2\x80\x94its abilities plummeted. It was not able to generalise what it had learned from a specific situation even to a situation that was only slightly different.\n\nBack to the future\n\nFor Dr Marcus, this example highlights the fragility of machine-learning. But others think it is symbolic reasoning which is brittle, and that machine learning still has a lot of mileage left in it. Among them is Jeff Hawke, vice-president of technology at Wayve, a self-driving-car firm in London. Wayve\xe2\x80\x99s approach is to train the software elements running a car\xe2\x80\x99s various components simultaneously, rather than separately. In demonstrations, Wayve\xe2\x80\x99s cars make good decisions while navigating narrow, heavily trafficked London streets\xe2\x80\x94a task that challenges many humans.\n\nAs Dr Hawke puts it, \xe2\x80\x9cthe complexity of most real-world tasks is greater than is possible to solve with handcrafted rules, and it\xe2\x80\x99s well known that expert systems built with rules tend to struggle with complexity. This is true regardless of how well thought out or structured the formal logic is.\xe2\x80\x9d Such a system might, for instance, craft a rule that a car should stop at a red light. But lights are designed differently in different countries, and some are intended for pedestrians rather than cars. There are also situations in which you might need to jump a red light, such as to make way for a fire engine. \xe2\x80\x9cThe beauty of machine learning\xe2\x80\x9d, Dr Hawke says, \xe2\x80\x9cis that all these factors and concepts can be automatically uncovered and learned from data. And with more data, it continues to learn and become more intelligent.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNicholas Rhinehart, who studies robotics and AI at the University of California, Berkeley, also backs machine learning. He says Dr Bhatt\xe2\x80\x99s approach does indeed show you can combine the two approaches. But he is not sure it is necessary. In his work, and also that of others, machine-learning systems alone can already predict probabilities a few seconds into the future\xe2\x80\x94such as whether another car is likely to give way or not\xe2\x80\x94and make contingency plans based on those predictions.\n\nDr Bhatt responds that you can train a car with data accumulated over millions of kilometres of driving, and still not be sure you have covered all the necessary situations. In many cases, it might be simpler and more effective to program some of the rules in from the start.\n\nFor champions of both strategies, the question goes beyond self-driving cars to the future of AI itself. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think we're taking the right approach right now,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr Marcus says. \xe2\x80\x9c[Machine learning] has proven useful for some things like speech recognition, but it's not actually the answer to AI .

"198.txt";"b'National Security Implications of Leadership in Autonomous Vehicles\n\nJune 28, 2021\n\nDigital technologies have created a transitional moment for societies. High-speed connectivity, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI) are ubiquitous (even if not always visible) and are reshaping economies by creating new opportunities. This follows a pattern set centuries ago. Automation of basic tasks began in the eighteenth century and accelerated rapidly at the end of the nineteenth century, with a new wave of automation now well underway. Autonomous systems already create value across global markets by lowering costs and improving services. The ability to combine better sensors, more powerful computer processing, and faster connectivity expands the productivity of human labor, creates new services, and automates existing ones.\n\nOne of the most important parts of the next wave of automation is transportation, specifically the appearance of self-driving, or \xe2\x80\x9cautonomous,\xe2\x80\x9d vehicles (AVs). Self-driving cars offer immense gains in productivity and safety. The technologies developed for self-driving cars have broad commercial (and potentially military) implications. A self-driving car is a vehicle capable of navigating without a driver actively operating or monitoring it. Self-driving cars are a kind of specialized robot\xe2\x80\x94not the humanoid robot common to popular culture, but self-operating devices that provide a commercially valuable service and automate routine tasks.\n\nThe impact of autonomous systems on the auto industry will be significant, as the technology behind AVs will reshape transportation and urban life as profoundly as the move from horses to cars. AVs are already a leadingsector for private AI investment, reflecting the market\xe2\x80\x99s estimate of their future importance.\n\nAutomation and the larger digital transformation create major challenges for national security, and the implications of AVs on national security deserve further attention. In addition to new opportunities, widespread deployment of AVs can also create new risks and vulnerabilities, particularly when considered in the context of tech competition between the United States and China.\n\nNational security can be defined as the condition where people can choose how they are governed and live in a world guided by the rule of law. To attain this requires an ability to defend the national interest and, increasingly, an ability to create and use technology in ways that support national security for both the near and long term. Technological leadership used to be seen as important for a few sectors, but its importance has spread across the entire economy. Innovation and the adoption of new technologies are the keys to the long-term growth needed for national security. This is particularly true for automobiles. Cars are now high-tech devices. Vehicles are built around semiconductors and software more than precisely engineered metal parts. The ability to build the cars of the future will be a good indicator of a country\xe2\x80\x99s technological strength and abilities.\n\nThe Military Applications of Autonomous Vehicles\n\nAs much of the innovation and work on AVs is now happening in the private sector, it is reasonable to ask how much carryover there will be from commercial to military uses. In the early stages of developing AV technology, there was considerable overlap. As development progressed, there has been divergence, and the direct application of commercial autonomy will be smaller (the same way a combat aircraft and a passenger aircraft that share certain technologies can jointly benefit from research and development but are ultimately designed for fundamentally different purposes and requirements).\n\nAutonomous devices that operate without human control are deeply attractive to militaries and are already deployed in aerospace and undersea vehicles by leading military powers. Autonomous ground vehicles are more challenging to develop, given the much more complex and varied terrain in which operations take place, but innovation in the commercial self-driving sector could improve military vehicles\xe2\x80\x99 operations. This will be seen first in logistics and support vehicles (e.g., autonomous trucks), where the transition from commercial to military is simpler, and perhaps later in combat vehicles.\n\nIt is not an accident that the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) was the government agency that began work on autonomous driving in 1984 with its Autonomous Land Vehicle program. DARPA then sponsored the earliest AV test in its Grand Challenges, which sought to accelerate the development of AV technologies by holding a race among prototypes for a cash prize. No one completed the first Grand Challenge in 2004. The second iteration, held in a desert area in 2005, was won by a university team which completed the 132-mile course in seven hours. DARPA held a third Grand Challenge two years later in a simulated urban environment, which was also won by another university team. These DARPA efforts, established in response to a 2001 National Defense Authorization Act mandate, jump-started the research into autonomous driving.\n\nBut the current geopolitical contest that threatens U.S. security is not a traditional military competition. It is a new kind of contest that underscores the importance of innovation capabilities and technology leadership. This means that having a strong AV sector, even if not directly applied to military use, is essential for national security. While there may be \xe2\x80\x9cspillover\xe2\x80\x9d effects from technology developed for commercial vehicles for military equipment, the primary contribution will be in strengthening digital industries. That is what will improve national economic performance and help reduce supply chain and espionage concerns. The importance of commercial development has grown. Since the end of the Cold War, advanced technologies have frequently originated in the private sector. The countries that will do best in economics and security will be those that have a strong private-sector tech base from which they can draw upon commercial technological developments.\n\nThe current geopolitical contest that threatens U.S. security is not a traditional military competition. . . . having a strong AV sector, even if not directly applied to military use, is essential for national security.\n\nThe main contribution of AVs to national security, however, does not come from self-driving tanks, but from the importance of the automotive sector to the nation. The automotive industry contributes 3.5 percent of U.S. GDP, making it one of the most important areas of industrial activity (as a comparison, the space and aerospace sector\xe2\x80\x99s share is 4 percent). The development of autonomous and electric vehicles involves the ability to develop and deploy a broad range of important emerging technologies, such as AI, autonomy, and electric propulsion and batteries, and will drive progress in innovation in ways that shape many sectors. Even though the vast majority of the vehicle market is commercial and civilian, when looking at the value of economic strength to national security, AVs are a critical sector for overall national security.\n\nAV Development in the Context of Tech Competition\n\nThe digital transition comes at a moment of significant geopolitical competition. The nature of global competition has changed and is increasingly a battle over technology and economic growth. The national capability to design, build, and innovate in technology will be crucial in this contest.\n\nTechnology creates new kinds of competition and conflict. Leadership in innovation and technology is central to global influence, prestige, and power. AVs are at the cutting edge of technology and are crucial to future U.S. strength. The United States has learned the hard way\xe2\x80\x94in the case of telecom infrastructure manufacturing and Huawei\xe2\x80\x99s extensive deployment and reach\xe2\x80\x94that it is not in the United States\xe2\x80\x99 interest to lose a strategic industry or to find itself dependent on an adversarial foreign power for key technologies. While there is minimal risk that the dynamic automotive sector in the United States would disappear like Nortel or Lucent, keeping this sector strong is essential for the national interest and national security. Automobiles are not an industry the United States can afford to lose any more than it would want to lose its aerospace industry.\n\nDeploying fully autonomous cars is an immense technological challenge, requiring advances in computing, sensors, and networking. The first step has been the deployment of assisted driving systems, which are now relatively common in newer cars. Full autonomy is several levels beyond this and in various stages of testing by several companies. This involves further advances in sensors and processing. The work to meet these challenges will deepen the U.S. technological base and, by commercializing research, strengthen it. Companies will also need a supportive regulatory environment to be able to deploy AVs at commercial scale. For the United States, a strong technology base and supportive regulatory environment is crucial for national security and for maintaining its global influence and economic strength.\n\nThe ability to apply new technologies to commercial and security matters is as important as the ability to create them. Nations that have the companies and skills to develop AI and apply it to economic activities will be stronger and more secure. It is not surprising then that more and more countries are developing their own AI strategies, highlighting their importance for growth and safety. Sixty countries have already collectively issued over 600 AI policy initiatives, including governance efforts and financial support for the sector. These policies will also help make the implementers more influential in the global arena, where global perceptions of tech leadership and economic performance provide substantial political benefit. This has been a core part of the United States\xe2\x80\x99 international strength since landing on the moon in the late 1960s and is one reason why the competition with China creates such serious concerns.\n\nFor the United States, a strong technology base and supportive regulatory environment is crucial for national security and for maintaining its global influence and economic strength.\n\nAdopting new technologies is the best path to creating wealth for countries such as the United States and the best way to increase productivity (which has been a problem for the United States and others, including China). AVs\xe2\x80\x99 most important contribution to national security may come from increasing the United States\xe2\x80\x99 productivity and wealth as part of the larger AI and robotics revolution.\n\nThe United States and China\n\nThere is a clear competition between the United States and China, and a major part of this competition is over leadership in technology. Both sides recognize the economic and security returns of technological leadership, and China has sought technological independence from the West for more than a century. The longer-term contest between the two is over how the world will be structured, and technological leadership is increasingly a determinant of national power.\n\nChina has a very different view of how societies should be governed, how international relations should be structured, and what its place should be among great powers. China is making a concerted and public effort to obtain superiority and to dominate key markets. The MIC2025 plan exemplifies the focus and importance of the technology sector. There are long-standing plans in China (albeit with mixed results) for a massive expansion of its technological capability. There is now a growing realization in the United States that it needs to respond to this, embodied in proposed legislation such as the Endless Frontier Act.\n\nThe desire in China to develop indigenous technological capabilities equivalent to the West dates back to the nineteenth century when European industrialization and its consequences displaced China from what it sees as its rightful place. China\xe2\x80\x99s lack of advanced technologies allowed troubling European interventions in China\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign affairs and began what the Chinese refer to as the \xe2\x80\x9cCentury of Humiliation,\xe2\x80\x9d where the once-great power lost sovereign control to imperialist states in Europe. Almost two centuries later, after surpassing Europe economically, China believes it has reached a moment when it can return to the center of global power. The obstacle to this return is the United States.\n\nThere are many questions about this Chinese narrative of resurgence under the Chinese Communist Party\xe2\x80\x99s (CCP) rule, but it meets compelling domestic political needs. The CCP\xe2\x80\x99s claim to unchallenged rule is buttressed by powerful nationalist sentiments, long present in China as a reaction to the West and now exploited by the CCP. China\xe2\x80\x99s president Xi Jinping has been clear in his views that the West is in decline and that a new world order should be centered on China. China\xe2\x80\x99s rise has been propelled by a number of factors, including heavy state investment in technology, but also by illicit measures, including a disregard for its World Trade Organization (WTO) commitments on the treatment of foreign companies, intellectual property (IP) theft, and a massive industrial espionage campaign targeting Western technology. China feels justified in these actions because of the Century of Humiliation and an artificial narrative about how the United States also relies on similar measures.\n\nChina\xe2\x80\x99s goals are to ensure that its economic development and modernization continues, to end reliance on foreign technologies, and to build a technology base strong enough to produce high-tech weaponry and commercial products that, when combined with subsidies, can displace foreign competitors. China uses a hybrid state/market model. \xe2\x80\x9cMilitary-Civil Fusion\xe2\x80\x9d moves China\xe2\x80\x99s economy much closer to a wartime footing, with a deep integration of the civilian and defense technological systems. Except in a few key areas, China\xe2\x80\x99s innovation system remains weaker than that of the United States. Self-driving cars, however, are an area where there are several competitive Chinese firms and Chinese technology is strong. China\xe2\x80\x99s government seeks to replace the United States in technological leadership and utilize technologies such as AVs to boost its military and economic competitiveness.\n\nThe 2021 annual threat assessment by the U.S. intelligence community addressed the risks to the United States\xe2\x80\x99 national security from emerging technologies. The report concludes that China will maintain its policies to promote indigenous technological innovation, since Chinese leaders perceive these policies as the way to \xe2\x80\x9creduce the dependence on foreign technologies, enable military advances, and sustain economic growth and thus ensure the CCP\xe2\x80\x99s survival.\xe2\x80\x9d AVs and self-driving cars are part of this larger competition between the United States and China. They are also central to the competition over the development and use of AI. In all countries, this AI competition involves a blend of government funding and private actors driven in part or entirely by market incentives and government subsidies.\n\nChina already has a robust AV industry aimed at the commercial market. In early 2017, Qiushi (the official journal of the CCP) identified innovative military technologies, such as unmanned tanks and remote-controlled shop trucks, as a unique opportunity for China to exceed the United States in military power.\n\nBoth China and the United States have advantages and disadvantages in a contest that revolves around technology, research, and investment. The United States benefits from a robust entrepreneurial environment, a dynamic and risk-taking financial system, a strong research base, and an innovation community skilled at commercializing research. China also has an entrepreneurial private sector and a growing research sector, but the government\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to invest large amounts over many years in its technological base is its primary advantage over the United States.\n\nChinese behaviors have eroded the commercial and technological globalization of the last three decades and, more importantly, pose a real national security risk to the United States. A world where China sets the rules will find that the rules are used to meet the needs of the CCP. Privacy is nonexistent in China and will be nonexistent in a world China leads. China will use its political power to confer commercial advantage on its companies at the expense of foreign competitors. This sounds harsh, but it is a description of the CCP, not of China itself.\n\nToday, China has the world\xe2\x80\x99s second-largest economy, supported by state-directed investment, is conducting aggressive industrial espionage programs globally over the internet, and is exhibiting a continued unwillingness to observe trade obligations. Using a Chinese AV, with all its internet connections, could be as risky as using Chinese telecoms.\n\nAutonomous Vehicles Will Create New Cybersecurity Risks and Vulnerabilities\n\nCybercrime is a lucrative activity. It cost the global economy more than a trillion dollars in 2019, and the rate of increase in costs has accelerated since 2010. Cybercrime harms public safety, undermines national security, and damages economies. Ransomware, phishing schemes, and cryptocurrencies make it easier to succeed and monetize cybercrime and, when combined with the sanctuary offered by big countries, help explain the rapid increase. AVs, given their reliance on software, computing, and connectivity, could be a new vector for cybersecurity risks.\n\nCars have become rolling computers, loaded with cameras, microphones, and other sensors, all operated by complex software. Increasingly, modern cars connect to the internet and collect information on location, speed, and perhaps on driver communications (e.g., text, email, voice). This means that data from cars can be accessed remotely, with the owner\xe2\x80\x99s permission or perhaps without it. Manufacturers already use this information for safety, convenience, predictive maintenance, and increasingly for entertainment. Future cars will collect even more data.\n\nSome of that data can reference locations and geographical features. Cross-border data transmission can be problematic if sensitive information is being collected. A 2017 paper from the Chinese Academy of Telecommunication Research of China\xe2\x80\x99s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology addresses that collection of information and considers it a matter of national security if foreign cars are used in China.\n\nAnything that is connected to the internet is vulnerable. The hardware and software behind AVs create a range of opportunities to hackers, as does the need to integrate hardware and software. Many different systems interact in a self-driving car and provide opportunities for hacking to manipulate different systems, including navigation, entertainment, or connectivity with other cars and infrastructure. Given their reliance on continuous communication, another concern is external manipulation of AV systems. From manipulating indicators or attacking the camera system to read speed signs incorrectly, to tampering with road paint to misguide the vehicle, AVs contribute to a vulnerable threat environment.\n\nIn-vehicle and inter-vehicle communication systems are necessary for the safe operation of AVs. In similar ways to the vulnerabilities created by the Internet of Things (IoT), the \xe2\x80\x9cInternet of Vehicles\xe2\x80\x9d (IoV) creates new challenges for cybersecurity. Cars have become another device at the edge of the network where connectivity tempts attackers. Vehicles require not only that their systems be able to communicate with each other, but also connect with other AVs or infrastructure relying on a wireless network.\n\nAnything that is connected to the internet is vulnerable. The hardware and software behind AVs create a range of opportunities to hackers, as does the need to integrate hardware and software.\n\nSupply chains can be compromised from the start. If AVs come from an untrustworthy source or if there are supply chain risks, even the best cybersecurity will not have an impact in risk reduction. A vehicle could be 100 percent unhackable, but if the manufacturer has built-in access and collection or if the information collected by the vehicle is sent over the internet to a hostile country, it will circumvent any defense. There is no need for a back door when the manufacturer has the key to the front door.\n\nRecent events highlight the potential for cybersecurity risks with AVs. Ransomware attacks, where an individual car or a class of cars could be rendered inoperable until a ransom is paid, are possible. While these could be aimed at individual car owners, it is more likely that cybercriminals will go after fleet operations or car manufacturers as better-paying possibilities. While a strong domestic AV industry will not eliminate cybersecurity risk, it would be much more preferable than a supply and car industry located in a hostile competitor.\n\nEspionage and Autonomous Vehicles\n\nThe concerns regarding cybersecurity and data protection are not only important for user protection, but also in the context of national security and geopolitical competition with China. The trove of data collected by AVs, paired with cybersecurity vulnerabilities, creates an appealing target for intelligence collection. AVs will require thinking of cars in a new way when it comes to espionage risk.\n\nIt is unlikely that the governments of other major car producers\xe2\x80\x94Germany, Japan, and Korea\xe2\x80\x94will exploit this advantage. They have no political or security motive to do so. China is another matter, however. A 2020 survey of Chinese espionage by CSIS found 152 publicly reported instances of Chinese espionage directed at the United States since 2000. This did not include espionage against U.S. firms or persons located in China, nor did it include the more than 1,200 IP theft cases brought by U.S. companies against Chinese entities. U.S. officials have repeatedly stated that China\xe2\x80\x99s espionage efforts exceed in scope and scale what was seen in the Cold War. This is because global digital networks and technologies provide China with immense new opportunities for espionage.\n\nIn China, the 2017 National Intelligence Law permits the Chinese government to demand and receive information from Chinese companies and citizens. Article 14 reads that \xe2\x80\x9cstate intelligence work organs, when legally carrying forth intelligence work, may demand that concerned organs, organizations, or citizens provide needed support, assistance, and cooperation.\xe2\x80\x9d Legally carrying forth intelligence work means any action authorized by the CPP leadership, which keeps close control over China\xe2\x80\x99s intelligence agencies and activities.\n\nThis means that data on location, behavior, and potentially conversations from the operators of Chinese-made cars could be accessed by the government over the internet. China is the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest surveillance state, and Chinese network technologies provide the Chinese government with the tools for monitoring behavior and collecting information on residents in its territory\xe2\x80\x94early examples include \xe2\x80\x9cGolden Shield\xe2\x80\x9d (a massive communications surveillance program) and \xe2\x80\x9cGreen Dam\xe2\x80\x9d (a monitoring and censorship program required on laptops in China). China may have tipped its hand about intent when it banned Tesla vehicles from driving into military facilities and housing compounds for personnel working in sensitive industries and state agencies. (Tesla has attempted to placate the Chinese by promising to hold all Chinese data in China.) The features that allow the collection and exfiltration of data potentially make cars an ideal surveillance platform.\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nIf this contest did not involve an unscrupulous and adversarial foreign power, it would be a normal commercial competition among companies, governed by the rules that apply to trade and the protection of IP. Commercial competition shapes U.S., European, Korean, and Japanese auto companies, but the same is not always true for China, where the government can play a much more directive role. That difference is what makes the contest over AVs so important.\n\nThere is a strong research base in Europe, and a long heritage of skilled engineering, but they have had difficulty commercializing the results of research. This may be less of a handicap in self-driving cars, given the strength and central position of the German auto industry, as long as Europe has access to leading-edge AI research and microelectronics from European and non-European sources. The contest takes place in a complicated international political environment. The chief complication is with Europe. Simply put, Berlin is a major driver of European policy, and it is currently unwilling to push hard on China because it is an essential market for Germany\xe2\x80\x99s car industry\xe2\x80\x94even though the Germans fear that China\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate intent is to ransack their automotive technology and displace German carmakers. This could damage a major U.S. security and economic partner in ways that harm both its interests and those of the United States. Trends in European politics suggest this more relaxed approach to China may be changing as suspicions about China\xe2\x80\x99s economic and political power grow.\n\nThe United States has also begun to address the decades-long shortfall in public investment on research and technology. The United States is unused to being challenged and was not prepared for this challenge from China. It has relied on technology to provide a qualitative advantage over opponents since World War II, but the requirements for technological advantage have changed. In the past, technological superiority was produced by a superb scientific establishment, long-term federal support for research, and close links between the research and industrial communities. Both support and linkages atrophied in the last few decades. More importantly, technological innovation is now led by the private sector and oriented toward commercial markets. This is where qualitative advantage for national security will come from in the future.\n\nTechnological progress is cumulative and continuous, and the pace at which nations adopt new technologies will help to determine their security relative to others. The nation that \xe2\x80\x9cdominates\xe2\x80\x9d AI (to quote Russian president Vladimir Putin) will not be \xe2\x80\x9cthe ruler of the world,\xe2\x80\x9d but the nation that is best at creating and accommodating technological change will do better in economics and security than others. The ability to employ AI and autonomous systems to gain better performance, new digital services, and create wealth is at the core of the new international competition and an area where the United States must ensure that its policies and regulations keep it competitive. No nation will \xe2\x80\x9cdominate\xe2\x80\x9d AI or the AV market, but being a leader in autonomy is a vital U.S. interest and crucial for national security.\n\nJames Andrew Lewis is a senior vice president and director of the Strategic Technologies Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, D.C.\n\nThis report is made possible by support from Cruise LLC.\n\nThis report is produced by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a private, tax-exempt institution focusing on international public policy issues.

Self-driving vehicles can also operate with less space between cars than is needed to allow for human driver reaction times. As a result, more vehicles can be accommodated on each mile of roadway, and could help identify specific areas for additional infrastructure.\n\nHowever, all of these benefits depend on a number of factors: achieving a critical mass of reliable autonomous vehicles that minimizes human input on driving, and creating interoperable and cooperative systems where vehicles and infrastructure can communicate in order to create more efficient traffic management, and consumer acceptance. These could be decades away.\n\nAutomated Vehicles to Hit the Road by 2020? Not So Fast\n\nWhen automakers and tech companies talk about Level 5 or fully self \xe2\x80\x93 driving vehicles, they aren\xe2\x80\x99t trying to find cars in a parking garage. Instead, modern vehicles are categorized by the level of autonomous technology they offer. Levels start at 0, for cars with no autonomous controls, and rise to Level 5 for cars that can perform all driving tasks and monitor the driving environment under all conditions in which a human driver could do the same.\n\nAutomakers and their partners, technology companies and research institutions are all working to develop self-driving technology and some experts say Level 5 vehicles could be on the road by 2020. In truth, autonomous technology exists on the road today in the form of safety features like adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking or lane keeping technologies that monitor the road and intervene when necessary.\n\nSome companies are already testing Level 4 or 5 vehicles, but these advanced technologies face technical challenges and human issues involving how drivers will interface with self-driving cars. Meanwhile, federal and state governments are determining how to adapt existing safety, licensing and liability laws and regulations to accommodate self-driving vehicles. As consumers slowly replace old cars with new cars, the U.S. will likely see a mix of vehicles with differing levels of automation on our roads for decades.\n\nAAA Q&A on Self-Driving Cars\n\nGreg Brannon has a bird\xe2\x80\x99s eye view of advancements in autonomous vehicles. As AAA\xe2\x80\x99s director of automotive engineering and industrial relations, Brannon manages the tests AAA runs on advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) such as adaptive cruise control and automatic emergency braking, which are precursors to fully-autonomous cars and trucks.\n\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s what Brannon has to say about where autonomous vehicle technology is today, its safety and security, and issues that will need to be addressed before fully automated self-driving cars hit the highway.'";"Autonomous Cars";"20.txt-Autonomous Cars"
"200.txt";"b'Road vehicle that is capable of moving safely with little or no human input\n\nFor broader coverage of this topic, see Vehicular automation\n\nA self-driving car, also known as an autonomous vehicle (AV or auto), driverless car, or robo-car (robotic car),[1][2][3] is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and moving safely with little or no human input.[4][5]\n\nSelf-driving cars combine a variety of sensors to perceive their surroundings, such as radar, lidar, sonar, GPS, odometry and inertial measurement units.[1][4] Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage.[4][6][7][8]\n\nPossible implementations of the technology include personal self-driving vehicles, shared robotaxis, connected vehicle platoons and long-distance trucking.[4] Several projects to develop a fully self-driving commercial car are in various stages of development. Waymo became the first service provider to offer robotaxi rides to the general public in a part of Phoenix, Arizona in 2020, while Tesla has said it will offer subscription-based ""full self-driving"" to private vehicle owners in 2021,[9][10] and Nuro has been allowed to start autonomous commercial delivery operations in California in 2021.[11] In China two publicly accessible trials of robo-taxis have been launched, in 2020 in Shenzhen\'s Pingshan District by Chinese firm AutoX[12] and in 2021 at Shougang Park in Beijing by Baidu, a venue for the 2022 Winter Olympics.[13]\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nExperiments have been conducted on automated driving systems (ADS) since at least the 1920s;[14] trials began in the 1950s. The first semi-automated car was developed in 1977, by Japan\'s Tsukuba Mechanical Engineering Laboratory, which required specially marked streets that were interpreted by two cameras on the vehicle and an analog computer. The vehicle reached speeds up to 30 kilometres per hour (19 mph) with the support of an elevated rail.[15][16]\n\nA landmark autonomous car appeared in the 1980s, with Carnegie Mellon University\'s Navlab[17] and ALV[18][19] projects funded by the United States\' Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) starting in 1984 and Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich\'s EUREKA Prometheus Project in 1987.[20] By 1985, the ALV had demonstrated self-driving speeds on two-lane roads of 31 kilometres per hour (19 mph), with obstacle avoidance added in 1986, and off-road driving in day and nighttime conditions by 1987.[21] A major milestone was achieved in 1995, with CMU\'s NavLab 5 completing the first autonomous coast-to-coast drive of the United States. Of the 2,849 mi (4,585 km) between Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and San Diego, California, 2,797 mi (4,501 km) were autonomous (98.2%), completed with an average speed of 63.8 mph (102.7 km/h).[22][23][24][25] From the 1960s through the second DARPA Grand Challenge in 2005, automated vehicle research in the United States was primarily funded by DARPA, the US Army, and the US Navy, yielding incremental advances in speeds, driving competence in more complex conditions, controls, and sensor systems.[26] Companies and research organizations have developed prototypes.[20][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34]\n\nThe US allocated US$650 million in 1991 for research on the National Automated Highway System, which demonstrated automated driving through a combination of automation embedded in the highway with automated technology in vehicles, and cooperative networking between the vehicles and with the highway infrastructure. The program concluded with a successful demonstration in 1997 but without clear direction or funding to implement the system on a larger scale.[35] Partly funded by the National Automated Highway System and DARPA, the Carnegie Mellon University Navlab drove 4,584 kilometres (2,848 mi) across America in 1995, 4,501 kilometres (2,797 mi) or 98% of it autonomously.[36] Navlab\'s record achievement stood unmatched for two decades until 2015, when Delphi improved it by piloting an Audi, augmented with Delphi technology, over 5,472 kilometres (3,400 mi) through 15 states while remaining in self-driving mode 99% of the time.[37] In 2015, the US states of Nevada, Florida, California, Virginia, and Michigan, together with Washington, DC, allowed the testing of automated cars on public roads.[38]\n\nFrom 2016 to 2018, the European Commission funded an innovation strategy development for connected and automated driving through the Coordination Actions CARTRE and SCOUT.[39] Moreover, the Strategic Transport Research and Innovation Agenda (STRIA) Roadmap for Connected and Automated Transport was published in 2019.[40]\n\nIn November 2017, Waymo announced that it had begun testing driverless cars without a safety driver in the driver position;[41] however, there was still an employee in the car.[42] An October 2017 report by the Brookings Institute found that the $80 billion had been reported as invested in all facets of self driving technology up to that point, but that it was ""reasonable to presume that total global investment in autonomous vehicle technology is significantly more than this.""[43]\n\nIn October 2018, Waymo announced that its test vehicles had traveled in automated mode for over 10,000,000 miles (16,000,000 km), increasing by about 1,000,000 miles (1,600,000 kilometres) per month.[44] In December 2018, Waymo was the first to commercialize a fully autonomous taxi service in the US, in Phoenix, Arizona.[45] In October 2020, Waymo launched a geo-fenced driverless ride hailing service in Phoenix.[46][47] The cars are being monitored in real-time by a team of remote engineers, and there are cases where the remote engineers need to intervene.[48][47]\n\nIn March 2019, ahead of the autonomous racing series Roborace, Robocar set the Guinness World Record for being the fastest autonomous car in the world. In pushing the limits of self-driving vehicles, Robocar reached 282.42 km/h (175.49 mph) \xe2\x80\x93 an average confirmed by the UK Timing Association at Elvington in Yorkshire, UK.[49]\n\nIn 2020, a National Transportation Safety Board chairman stated that no self-driving cars (SAE level 3+) were available for consumers to purchase in the US in 2020:\n\nThere is not a vehicle currently available to US consumers that is self-driving. Period. Every vehicle sold to US consumers still requires the driver to be actively engaged in the driving task, even when advanced driver assistance systems are activated. If you are selling a car with an advanced driver assistance system, you\xe2\x80\x99re not selling a self-driving car. If you are driving a car with an advanced driver assistance system, you don\xe2\x80\x99t own a self-driving car.[50]\n\nOn 5 March 2021, Honda began leasing in Japan a limited edition of 100 Legend Hybrid EX sedans equipped with the newly approved Level 3 automated driving equipment which had been granted the safety certification by Japanese government to their autonomous ""Traffic Jam Pilot"" driving technology, and legally allow drivers to take their eyes off the road.[51][52][53][54]\n\nDefinitions and classifications [ edit ]\n\nThere is some inconsistency in the terminology used in the self-driving car industry. Various organizations have proposed to define an accurate and consistent vocabulary.\n\nIn 2014, such confusion has been documented in SAE J3016 which states that ""some vernacular usages associate autonomous specifically with full driving automation (Level 5), while other usages apply it to all levels of driving automation, and some state legislation has defined it to correspond approximately to any ADS [automated driving system] at or above Level 3 (or to any vehicle equipped with such an ADS).""\n\nTerminology and safety considerations [ edit ]\n\nModern vehicles provide features such as keeping the car within its lane, speed controls, or emergency braking. Those features alone are just considered as driver assistance technologies because they still require a human driver control while fully automated vehicles drive themselves without human driver input.\n\nAccording to Fortune, some newer vehicles\' technology names\xe2\x80\x94such as AutonoDrive, PilotAssist, Full-Self Driving or DrivePilot\xe2\x80\x94might confuse the driver, who may believe no driver input is expected when in fact the driver needs to remain involved in the driving task.[55] According to the BBC, confusion between those concepts leads to deaths.[56]\n\nFor this reason, some organizations such as the AAA try to provide standardized naming conventions for features such as ALKS which aim to have capacity to manage the driving task, but which are not yet approved to be an automated vehicles in any countries. The Association of British Insurers considers the usage of the word autonomous in marketing for modern cars to be dangerous because car ads make motorists think \'autonomous\' and \'autopilot\' mean a vehicle can drive itself when they still rely on the driver to ensure safety. Technology alone still is not able to drive the car.\n\nSome car makers suggest or claim vehicles are self-driving when they are not able to manage some driving situations. Despite being called Full Self-Driving, Tesla stated that its offering should not be considered as a fully autonomous driving system.[57] This makes drivers risk becoming excessively confident, taking distracted driving behavior, leading to crashes. While in Great-Britain, a fully self-driving car is only a car registered in a specific list.[58] There have also been proposals to adopt the aviation automation safety knowledge into the discussions of safe implementation of autonomous vehicles, due to the experience that has been gained over the decades by the aviation sector on safety topics. [59]\n\nAutonomous vs. automated [ edit ]\n\nAutonomous means self-governing.[60] Many historical projects related to vehicle automation have been automated (made automatic) subject to a heavy reliance on artificial aids in their environment, such as magnetic strips. Autonomous control implies satisfactory performance under significant uncertainties in the environment, and the ability to compensate for system failures without external intervention.[60]\n\nOne approach is to implement communication networks both in the immediate vicinity (for collision avoidance) and farther away (for congestion management). Such outside influences in the decision process reduce an individual vehicle\'s autonomy, while still not requiring human intervention.\n\nWood et al. (2012) wrote, ""This Article generally uses the term \'autonomous,\' instead of the term \'automated.\' "" The term ""autonomous"" was chosen ""because it is the term that is currently in more widespread use (and thus is more familiar to the general public). However, the latter term is arguably more accurate. \'Automated\' connotes control or operation by a machine, while \'autonomous\' connotes acting alone or independently. Most of the vehicle concepts (that we are currently aware of) have a person in the driver\'s seat, utilize a communication connection to the Cloud or other vehicles, and do not independently select either destinations or routes for reaching them. Thus, the term \'automated\' would more accurately describe these vehicle concepts.""[61]\n\nAs of 2017, most commercial projects focused on automated vehicles that did not communicate with other vehicles or with an enveloping management regime. EuroNCAP defines autonomous in ""Autonomous Emergency Braking"" as: ""the system acts independently of the driver to avoid or mitigate the accident."" which implies the autonomous system is not the driver.[62]\n\nIn Europe, the words automated and autonomous might also be used together. For instance, Regulation (EU) 2019/2144 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2019 on type-approval requirements for motor vehicles (...) defines ""automated vehicle"" and ""fully automated vehicle"" based on their autonomous capacity:[63]\n\n""automated vehicle"" means a motor vehicle designed and constructed to move autonomously for certain periods of time without continuous driver supervision but in respect of which driver intervention is still expected or required; [63]\n\n""fully automated vehicle"" means a motor vehicle that has been designed and constructed to move autonomously without any driver supervision;[63]\n\nIn British English, the word automated alone might have several meaning, such in the sentence: ""Thatcham also found that the automated lane keeping systems could only meet two out of the twelve principles required to guarantee safety, going on to say they cannot, therefore, be classed as \xe2\x80\x98automated driving\xe2\x80\x99, instead it claims the tech should be classed as \xe2\x80\x98assisted driving\xe2\x80\x99."":[64] The first occurrence of the ""automated"" word refers to an Unece automated system, while the second occurrence refers to the British legal definition of an automated vehicle. The British law interprets the meaning of ""automated vehicle"" based on the interpretation section related to a vehicle ""driving itself"" and an insured vehicle.[65]\n\nAutonomous versus cooperative [ edit ]\n\nTo enable a car to travel without any driver embedded within the vehicle, some companies use a remote driver.[66]\n\nAccording to SAE J3016,\n\nSome driving automation systems may indeed be autonomous if they perform all of their functions independently and self-sufficiently, but if they depend on communication and/or cooperation with outside entities, they should be considered cooperative rather than autonomous.\n\nClassifications [ edit ]\n\nSelf-driving car [ edit ]\n\nPC Magazine defines a self-driving car as ""a computer-controlled car that drives itself.""[67] The Union of Concerned Scientists states that self-driving cars are ""cars or trucks in which human drivers are never required to take control to safely operate the vehicle. Also known as autonomous or \'driverless\' cars, they combine sensors and software to control, navigate, and drive the vehicle.""[68]\n\nThe British Automated and Electric Vehicles Act 2018 law defines considers a vehicle as ""driving itself"" if the vehicle ""is operating in a mode in which it is not being controlled, and does not need to be monitored, by an individual"".[69]\n\nSAE Classification [ edit ]\n\nA classification system with six levels \xe2\x80\x93 ranging from fully manual to fully automated systems \xe2\x80\x93 was published in 2014 by automotive standardization body SAE International (formerly the Society of Automotive Engineers) as J3016, Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to On-Road Motor Vehicle Automated Driving Systems.[72][73] This classification is based on the amount of driver intervention and attentiveness required, rather than the vehicle\'s capabilities, although these are loosely related. In the United States in 2013, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) released a formal classification system,[74] but abandoned it in favor of the SAE standard in 2016. Also in 2016, SAE updated its classification, called J3016_201609.[75]\n\nLevels of driving automation [ edit ]\n\nIn SAE\'s automation level definitions, ""driving mode"" means ""a type of driving scenario with characteristic dynamic driving task requirements (e.g., expressway merging, high speed cruising, low speed traffic jam, closed-campus operations, etc.)""[1][76]\n\nLevel 0: The automated system issues warnings and may momentarily intervene but has no sustained vehicle control.\n\nLevel 1 (""hands on""): The driver and the automated system share control of the vehicle. Examples are systems where the driver controls steering and the automated system controls engine power to maintain a set speed (Cruise Control) or engine and brake power to maintain and vary speed (Adaptive Cruise Control or ACC); and Parking Assistance, where steering is automated while speed is under manual control. The driver must be ready to retake full control at any time. Lane Keeping Assistance (LKA) Type II is a further example of Level 1 self-driving. Automatic emergency braking which alerts the driver to a crash and permits full braking capacity is also a Level 1 feature, according to Autopilot Review magazine. [77]\n\nmagazine. Level 2 (""hands off""): The automated system takes full control of the vehicle: accelerating, braking, and steering. The driver must monitor the driving and be prepared to intervene immediately at any time if the automated system fails to respond properly. The shorthand ""hands off"" is not meant to be taken literally \xe2\x80\x93 contact between hand and wheel is often mandatory during SAE 2 driving, to confirm that the driver is ready to intervene. The eyes of the driver might be monitored by cameras to confirm that the driver is keeping their attention to traffic. Literal hands off driving is considered level 2.5, although there is no half levels officially. A common example is adaptive cruise control which also utilizes lane keeping assist technology so that the driver simply monitors the vehicle, such as ""Super-Cruise"" in the Cadillac CT6 by General Motors or Ford\'s F-150 BlueCruise. [78]\n\nLevel 3 (""eyes off""): The driver can safely turn their attention away from the driving tasks, e.g. the driver can text or watch a movie. The vehicle will handle situations that call for an immediate response, like emergency braking. The driver must still be prepared to intervene within some limited time, specified by the manufacturer, when called upon by the vehicle to do so. You can think of the automated system as a co-driver that will alert you in an orderly fashion when it is your turn to drive. An example would be a Traffic Jam Chauffeur, [79] another example would be a car satisfying the international Automated Lane Keeping System (ALKS) regulations. [80]\n\nanother example would be a car satisfying the international Automated Lane Keeping System (ALKS) regulations. Level 4 (""mind off""): As level 3, but no driver attention is ever required for safety, e.g. the driver may safely go to sleep or leave the driver\'s seat. However, self-driving is supported only in limited spatial areas (geofenced) or under special circumstances. Outside of these areas or circumstances, the vehicle must be able to safely abort the trip, e.g. slow down and park the car, if the driver does not retake control. An example would be a robotic taxi or a robotic delivery service that covers selected locations in an area, at a specific time and quantities.\n\nLevel 5 (""steering wheel optional""): No human intervention is required at all. An example would be a robotic vehicle that works on all kinds of surfaces, all over the world, all year around, in all weather conditions.\n\nIn the formal SAE definition below, an important transition is from SAE Level 2 to SAE Level 3 in which the human driver is no longer expected to monitor the environment continuously. At SAE 3, the human driver still has responsibility to intervene when asked to do so by the automated system. At SAE 4 the human driver is always relieved of that responsibility and at SAE 5 the automated system will never need to ask for an intervention.\n\nSAE (J3016) Automation Levels[76] SAE Level Name Narrative definition Execution of\n\nsteering and\n\nacceleration/\n\ndeceleration Monitoring of driving environment Fallback performance of dynamic driving task System capability (driving modes) Human driver monitors the driving environment 0 No Automation The full-time performance by the human driver of all aspects of the dynamic driving task, even when ""enhanced by warning or intervention systems"" Human driver Human driver Human driver n/a 1 Driver Assistance The driving mode-specific execution by a driver assistance system of ""either steering or acceleration/deceleration"" using information about the driving environment and with the expectation that the human driver performs all remaining aspects of the dynamic driving task Human driver and system Some driving modes 2 Partial Automation The driving mode-specific execution by one or more driver assistance systems of both steering and acceleration/deceleration System Automated driving system monitors the driving environment 3 Conditional Automation The driving mode-specific performance by an automated driving system of all aspects of the dynamic driving task with the expectation that the human driver will respond appropriately to a request to intervene System System Human driver Some driving modes 4 High Automation even if a human driver does not respond appropriately to a request to intervene the car can pull over safely by guiding system System Many driving modes 5 Full Automation under all roadway and environmental conditions that can be managed by a human driver All driving modes\n\nCriticism of SAE [ edit ]\n\nThe SAE Automation Levels have been criticized for their technological focus. It has been argued that the structure of the levels suggests that automation increases linearly and that more automation is better, which may not always be the case.[81] The SAE Levels also do not account for changes that may be required to infrastructure[82] and road user behavior.[83][84]\n\nTechnology [ edit ]\n\nThe characteristics of autonomous vehicles, as digital technology, are distinguishable from other types of technologies and vehicles. These characteristics mean autonomous vehicles are able to be more transformative and agile to possible changes. The characteristics include hybrid navigation, homogenization and decoupling, vehicle communication systems, reprogrammable and smart, digital traces and modularity.\n\nHybrid navigation [ edit ]\n\nThere are different systems that help the self-driving car control the car, including the car navigation system, the location system, the electronic map, the map matching, the global path planning, the environment perception, the laser perception, the radar perception, the visual perception, the vehicle control, the perception of vehicle speed and direction, and the vehicle control method.[85]\n\nDriverless car designers are challenged with producing control systems capable of analyzing sensory data in order to provide accurate detection of other vehicles and the road ahead.[86] Modern self-driving cars generally use Bayesian simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms,[87] which fuse data from multiple sensors and an off-line map into current location estimates and map updates. Waymo has developed a variant of SLAM with detection and tracking of other moving objects (DATMO), which also handles obstacles such as cars and pedestrians. Simpler systems may use roadside real-time locating system (RTLS) technologies to aid localization. Typical sensors include lidar (Light Detection and Ranging), stereo vision, GPS and IMU.[88][89] Control systems on automated cars may use Sensor Fusion, which is an approach that integrates information from a variety of sensors on the car to produce a more consistent, accurate, and useful view of the environment.[90] Heavy rainfall, hail, or snow could impede the car sensors.[citation needed]\n\nDriverless vehicles require some form of machine vision for the purpose of visual object recognition. Automated cars are being developed with deep neural networks,[88] a type of deep learning architecture with many computational stages, or levels, in which neurons are simulated from the environment that activate the network.[91] The neural network depends on an extensive amount of data extracted from real-life driving scenarios,[88] enabling the neural network to ""learn"" how to execute the best course of action.[91]\n\nIn May 2018, researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology announced that they had built an automated car that can navigate unmapped roads.[92] Researchers at their Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) have developed a new system, called MapLite, which allows self-driving cars to drive on roads that they have never been on before, without using 3D maps. The system combines the GPS position of the vehicle, a ""sparse topological map"" such as OpenStreetMap, (i.e. having 2D features of the roads only), and a series of sensors that observe the road conditions.[93]\n\nHomogenization and decoupling [ edit ]\n\nHomogenization indicates the fact that all digital information assumes the same form. During the ongoing evolution of the digital era, certain industry standards have been developed on how to store digital information and in what type of format. This concept of homogenization also applies to autonomous vehicles. In order for autonomous vehicles to perceive their surroundings, they have to use different techniques each with their own accompanying digital information (e.g. radar, GPS, motion sensors and computer vision). Homogenization requires that the digital information from these different sources is transmitted and stored in the same form. This means their differences are decoupled, and digital information can be transmitted, stored, and computed in a way that the vehicles and their operating system can better understand and act upon it. Homogenization also helps to take advantage of the exponential increase of the computing power of hardware and software (Moore\'s law) which also supports the autonomous vehicles to understand and act upon the digital information in a more cost-effective way, therefore lowering the marginal costs.[citation needed]\n\nVehicle communication systems [ edit ]\n\nIndividual vehicles can benefit from information obtained from other vehicles in the vicinity, especially information relating to traffic congestion and safety hazards. Vehicular communication systems use vehicles and roadside units as the communicating nodes in a peer-to-peer network, providing each other with information. As a cooperative approach, vehicular communication systems can allow all cooperating vehicles to be more effective. According to a 2010 study by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, vehicular communication systems could help avoid up to 79% of all traffic accidents.[94]\n\nThere have so far been no complete implementation of peer-to-peer networking on the scale required for traffic.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2012, computer scientists at the University of Texas in Austin began developing smart intersections designed for automated cars. The intersections will have no traffic lights and no stop signs, instead using computer programs that will communicate directly with each car on the road.[95] In the case of autonomous vehicles, it is essential for them to connect with other \'devices\' in order to function most effectively. Autonomous vehicles are equipped with communication systems which allow them to communicate with other autonomous vehicles and roadside units to provide them, amongst other things, with information about road work or traffic congestion. In addition, scientists believe that the future will have computer programs that connect and manage each individual autonomous vehicle as it navigates through an intersection. This type of connectivity must replace traffic lights and stop signs.[95] These types of characteristics drive and further develop the ability of autonomous vehicles to understand and cooperate with other products and services (such as intersection computer systems) in the autonomous vehicles market. This could lead to a network of autonomous vehicles all using the same network and information available on that network. Eventually, this can lead to more autonomous vehicles using the network because the information has been validated through the usage of other autonomous vehicles. Such movements will strengthen the value of the network and is called network externalities.\n\nAmong connected cars, an unconnected one is the weakest and will be increasingly banned from busy high-speed roads, as predicted by the Helsinki think tank, Nordic Communications Corporation, in January 2016.[96]\n\nIn 2017, Researchers from Arizona State University developed a 1/10 scale intersection and proposed an intersection management technique called Crossroads. It was shown that Crossroads is very resilient to network delay of both V2I communication and Worst-case Execution time of the intersection manager.[97] In 2018, a robust approach was introduced which is resilient to both model mismatch and external disturbances such as wind and bumps.[98]\n\nVehicle networking may be desirable due to difficulty with computer vision being able to recognize brake lights, turn signals, buses, and similar things. However, the usefulness of such systems would be diminished by the fact current cars are not equipped with them; they may also pose privacy concerns.[99]\n\nReprogrammable [ edit ]\n\nAnother characteristic of autonomous vehicles is that the core product will have a greater emphasis on the software and its possibilities, instead of the chassis and its engine. This is because autonomous vehicles have software systems that drive the vehicle, meaning that updates through reprogramming or editing the software can enhance the benefits of the owner (e.g. update in better distinguishing blind person vs. non-blind person so that the vehicle will take extra caution when approaching a blind person). A characteristic of this reprogrammable part of autonomous vehicles is that the updates need not only to come from the supplier, because through machine learning, smart autonomous vehicles can generate certain updates and install them accordingly (e.g. new navigation maps or new intersection computer systems). These reprogrammable characteristics of the digital technology and the possibility of smart machine learning give manufacturers of autonomous vehicles the opportunity to differentiate themselves on software. This also implies that autonomous vehicles are never finished because the product can continuously be improved.[citation needed]\n\nDigital traces [ edit ]\n\nAutonomous vehicles are equipped with different sorts of sensors and radars. As said, this allows them to connect and interoperate with computers from other autonomous vehicles and/or roadside units. This implies that autonomous vehicles leave digital traces when they connect or interoperate. The data that comes from these digital traces can be used to develop new (to be determined) products or updates to enhance autonomous vehicles\' driving ability or safety.[citation needed]\n\nModularity [ edit ]\n\nTraditional vehicles and their accompanying technologies are manufactured as a product that will be complete, and unlike autonomous vehicles, they can only be improved if they are redesigned or reproduced. As said, autonomous vehicles are produced but due to their digital characteristics never finished. This is because autonomous vehicles are more modular since they are made up out of several modules which will be explained hereafter through a Layered Modular Architecture. The Layered Modular Architecture extends the architecture of purely physical vehicles by incorporating four loosely coupled layers of devices, networks, services and contents into Autonomous Vehicles. These loosely coupled layers can interact through certain standardized interfaces.\n\n(1) The first layer of this architecture consists of the device layer. This layer consists of the following two parts: logical capability and physical machinery. The physical machinery refers to the actual vehicle itself (e.g. chassis and carrosserie). When it comes to digital technologies, the physical machinery is accompanied by a logical capability layer in the form of operating systems that helps to guide the vehicles itself and make it autonomous. The logical capability provides control over the vehicle and connects it with the other layers.;\n\n(2) On top of the device layer comes the network layer. This layer also consists of two different parts: physical transport and logical transmission. The physical transport layer refers to the radars, sensors and cables of the autonomous vehicles which enable the transmission of digital information. Next to that, the network layer of autonomous vehicles also has a logical transmission which contains communication protocols and network standard to communicate the digital information with other networks and platforms or between layers. This increases the accessibility of the autonomous vehicles and enables the computational power of a network or platform.;\n\n(3) The service layer contains the applications and their functionalities that serves the autonomous vehicle (and its owners) as they extract, create, store and consume content with regards to their own driving history, traffic congestion, roads or parking abilities for example.; and\n\n(4) The final layer of the model is the contents layer. This layer contains the sounds, images and videos. The autonomous vehicles store, extract and use to act upon and improve their driving and understanding of the environment. The contents layer also provides metadata and directory information about the content\'s origin, ownership, copyright, encoding methods, content tags, geo-time stamps, and so on (Yoo et al., 2010).\n\nThe consequence of layered modular architecture of autonomous vehicles (and other digital technologies) is that it enables the emergence and development of platforms and ecosystems around a product and/or certain modules of that product. Traditionally, automotive vehicles were developed, manufactured and maintained by traditional manufacturers. Nowadays app developers and content creators can help to develop more comprehensive product experience for the consumers which creates a platform around the product of autonomous vehicles.\n\nChallenges [ edit ]\n\nThe potential benefits from increased vehicle automation described may be limited by foreseeable challenges such as disputes over liability,[100][101] the time needed to turn over the existing stock of vehicles from non-automated to automated,[102] and thus a long period of humans and autonomous vehicles sharing the roads, resistance by individuals to forfeiting control of their cars,[103] concerns about safety,[104] and the implementation of a legal framework and consistent global government regulations for self-driving cars.[105]\n\nOther obstacles could include de-skilling and lower levels of driver experience for dealing with potentially dangerous situations and anomalies,[106] ethical problems where an automated vehicle\'s software is forced during an unavoidable crash to choose between multiple harmful courses of action (\'the trolley problem\'),[107][108] concerns about making large numbers of people currently employed as drivers unemployed, the potential for more intrusive mass surveillance of location, association and travel as a result of police and intelligence agency access to large data sets generated by sensors and pattern-recognition AI, and possibly insufficient understanding of verbal sounds, gestures and non-verbal cues by police, other drivers or pedestrians.[109]\n\nAutonomous delivery vehicles stuck in one place by attempting to avoid one another.\n\nPossible technological obstacles for automated cars are:\n\nArtificial Intelligence is still not able to function properly in chaotic inner-city environments. [110]\n\nA car\'s computer could potentially be compromised, as could a communication system between cars. [111] [112] [113] [114] [115]\n\nSusceptibility of the car\'s sensing and navigation systems to different types of weather (such as snow) or deliberate interference, including jamming and spoofing. [109]\n\nAvoidance of large animals requires recognition and tracking, and Volvo found that software suited to caribou, deer, and elk was ineffective with kangaroos. [116]\n\nAutonomous cars may require high-definition maps to operate properly. Where these maps may be out of date, they would need to be able to fall back to reasonable behaviors.\n\nCompetition for the radio spectrum desired for the car\'s communication. [117]\n\nField programmability for the systems will require careful evaluation of product development and the component supply chain. [115]\n\nCurrent road infrastructure may need changes for automated cars to function optimally. [118]\n\nValidation challenge of Automated Driving and need for novel simulation-based approaches comprising digital twins and agent-based traffic simulation.[119]\n\nSocial challenges include:\n\nUncertainty about potential future regulation may delay deployment of automated cars on the road. [120]\n\nEmployment \xe2\x80\x93 Companies working on the technology have an increasing recruitment problem in that the available talent pool has not grown with demand.[121] As such, education and training by third-party organizations such as providers of online courses and self-taught community-driven projects such as DIY Robocars[122] and Formula Pi have quickly grown in popularity, while university level extra-curricular programmes such as Formula Student Driverless[123] have bolstered graduate experience. Industry is steadily increasing freely available information sources, such as code,[124] datasets[125] and glossaries[126] to widen the recruitment pool.\n\nHuman factor [ edit ]\n\nSelf-driving cars are already exploring the difficulties of determining the intentions of pedestrians, bicyclists, and animals, and models of behavior must be programmed into driving algorithms.[8] Human road users also have the challenge of determining the intentions of autonomous vehicles, where there is no driver with which to make eye contact or exchange hand signals. Drive.ai is testing a solution to this problem that involves LED signs mounted on the outside of the vehicle, announcing status such as ""going now, don\'t cross"" vs. ""waiting for you to cross"".[127]\n\nTwo human-factor challenges are important for safety. One is the handoff from automated driving to manual driving, which may become necessary due to unfavorable or unusual road conditions, or if the vehicle has limited capabilities. A sudden handoff could leave a human driver dangerously unprepared in the moment. In the long term, humans who have less practice at driving might have a lower skill level and thus be more dangerous in manual mode. The second challenge is known as risk compensation: as a system is perceived to be safer, instead of benefiting entirely from all of the increased safety, people engage in riskier behavior and enjoy other benefits. Semi-automated cars have been shown to suffer from this problem, for example with users of Tesla Autopilot ignoring the road and using electronic devices or other activities against the advice of the company that the car is not capable of being completely autonomous. In the near future, pedestrians and bicyclists may travel in the street in a riskier fashion if they believe self-driving cars are capable of avoiding them.\n\nIn order for people to buy self-driving cars and vote for the government to allow them on roads, the technology must be trusted as safe.[128][129] Self-driving elevators were invented in 1900, but the high number of people refusing to use them slowed adoption for several decades until operator strikes increased demand and trust was built with advertising and features like the emergency stop button.[130][131] There are three types of trust between human and automation.[132] There is dispositional trust, the trust between the driver and the company\'s product.[132] Situational trust, or the trust from different scenarios.[132] Finally there is learned trust where the trust is built between similar events.[132]\n\nMoral issues [ edit ]\n\nWith the emergence of automated automobiles, various ethical issues arise. While the introduction of automated vehicles to the mass market is said to be inevitable due to a presumed but untestable potential for reduction of crashes by ""up to"" 90%[133] and their potential greater accessibility to disabled, elderly, and young passengers, a range of ethical issues have been posed. Those include, but are not limited to:\n\nThe moral, financial, and criminal responsibility for crashes and breaches of law\n\nThe decisions a car is to make right before a potentially fatal crash\n\nPrivacy issues, including the potential for mass surveillance\n\nPotential for massive job losses and unemployment among drivers\n\nDe-skilling and loss of independence by vehicle users\n\nExposure to hacking and malware\n\nThe further concentration of market and data power in the hands of a few global conglomerates capable of consolidating AI capacity and of lobbying governments to facilitate the shift of liability onto others and their potential destruction of existing occupations and industries.\n\nThere are different opinions on who should be held liable in case of a crash, especially with people being hurt. Many experts see the car manufacturers themselves being responsible for those crashes that occur due to a technical malfunction or misconstruction.[134] Besides the fact that the car manufacturer would be the source of the problem in a situation where a car crashes due to a technical issue, there is another important reason why car manufacturers could be held responsible: it would encourage them to innovate and heavily invest into fixing those issues, not only due to protection of the brand image, but also due to financial and criminal consequences. However, there are also voices[who?] that argue those using or owning the vehicle should be held responsible since they know the risks involved in using such a vehicle. One study suggests requesting the owners of self-driving cars to sign end-user license agreements (EULAs), assigning to them accountability for any accidents.[135] Other studies suggest introducing a tax or insurances that would protect owners and users of automated vehicles of claims made by victims of an accident.[134] Other possible parties that can be held responsible in case of a technical failure include software engineers that programmed the code for the automated operation of the vehicles, and suppliers of components of the AV.[136]\n\nTaking aside the question of legal liability and moral responsibility, the question arises how automated vehicles should be programmed to behave in an emergency situation where either passengers or other traffic participants like pedestrians, bicyclists and other drivers are endangered. A moral dilemma that a software engineer or car manufacturer might face in programming the operating software is described in an ethical thought experiment, the trolley problem: a conductor of a trolley has the choice of staying on the planned track and running over five people, or turn the trolley onto a track where it would kill only one person, assuming there is no traffic on it.[137] When a self-driving car is in following scenario: it\'s driving with passengers and suddenly a person appears in its way. The car has to decide between the two options, either to run the person over or to avoid hitting the person by swerving into a wall, killing the passengers.[138] There are two main considerations that need to be addressed. First, what moral basis would be used by an automated vehicle to make decisions? Second, how could those be translated into software code? Researchers have suggested, in particular, two ethical theories to be applicable to the behavior of automated vehicles in cases of emergency: deontology and utilitarianism.[8][139] Asimov\'s Three Laws of Robotics are a typical example of deontological ethics. The theory suggests that an automated car needs to follow strict written-out rules that it needs to follow in any situation. Utilitarianism suggests the idea that any decision must be made based on the goal to maximize utility. This needs a definition of utility which could be maximizing the number of people surviving in a crash. Critics suggest that automated vehicles should adapt a mix of multiple theories to be able to respond morally right in the instance of a crash.[8][139] Recently, some specific ethical frameworks i.e., utilitarianism, deontology, relativism, absolutism (monism), and pluralism, are investigated empirically with respect to the acceptance of self-driving cars in unavoidable accidents.[140]\n\nMany \'trolley\' discussions skip over the practical problems of how a probabilistic machine learning vehicle AI could be sophisticated enough to understand that a deep problem of moral philosophy is presenting itself from instant to instant while using a dynamic projection into the near future, what sort of moral problem it actually would be if any, what the relevant weightings in human value terms should be given to all the other humans involved who will be probably unreliably identified, and how reliably it can assess the probable outcomes. These practical difficulties, and those around testing and assessment of solutions to them, may present as much of a challenge as the theoretical abstractions.[141]\n\nWhile most trolley conundrums involve hyperbolic and unlikely fact patterns, it is inevitable mundane ethical decisions and risk calculations such as the precise millisecond a car should yield to a yellow light or how closely to drive to a bike lane will need to be programmed into the software of autonomous vehicles.[8][142] Mundane ethical situations may even be more relevant than rare fatal circumstances because of the specificity implicated and their large scope.[142] Mundane situations involving drivers and pedestrians are so prevalent that, in the aggregate, produce large amounts of injuries and deaths.[142] Hence, even incremental permutations of moral algorithms can have a notable effect when considered in their entirety.[142]\n\nPrivacy-related issues arise mainly from the interconnectivity of automated cars, making it just another mobile device that can gather any information about an individual (see data mining). This information gathering ranges from tracking of the routes taken, voice recording, video recording, preferences in media that is consumed in the car, behavioral patterns, to many more streams of information.[99][143][144] The data and communications infrastructure needed to support these vehicles may also be capable of surveillance, especially if coupled to other data sets and advanced analytics.[99]\n\nThe implementation of automated vehicles to the mass market might cost up to 5 million jobs in the US alone, making up almost 3% of the workforce.[145] Those jobs include drivers of taxis, buses, vans, trucks, and e-hailing vehicles. Many industries, such as the auto insurance industry are indirectly affected. This industry alone generates an annual revenue of about US$220 billion, supporting 277,000 jobs.[146] To put this into perspective\xe2\x80\x93this is about the number of mechanical engineering jobs.[147] The potential loss of a majority of those jobs will have a tremendous impact on those individuals involved.[148]\n\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has animated the trolley problem in the context of autonomous cars in a website called The Moral Machine.[149] The Moral Machine generates random scenarios in which autonomous cars malfunction and forces the user to choose between two harmful courses of action.[149] MIT\'s Moral Machine experiment has collected data involving over 40 million decisions from people in 233 countries to ascertain peoples\' moral preferences. The MIT study illuminates that ethical preferences vary among cultures and demographics and likely correlate with modern institutions and geographic traits.[149]\n\nGlobal trends of the MIT study highlight that, overall, people prefer to save the lives of humans over other animals, prioritize the lives of many rather than few, and spare the lives of young rather than old.[149] Men are slightly more likely to spare the lives of women, and religious affiliates are slightly more likely to prioritize human life. The lives of criminals were prioritized more than cats, but the lives of dogs were prioritized more than the lives of criminals.[150] The lives of homeless were spared more than the elderly, but the lives of homeless were spared less often than the obese.[150]\n\nPeople overwhelmingly express a preference for autonomous vehicles to be programmed with utilitarian ideas, that is, in a manner that generates the least harm and minimizes driving casualties.[151] While people want others to purchase utilitarian promoting vehicles, they themselves prefer to ride in vehicles that prioritize the lives of people inside the vehicle at all costs.[151] This presents a paradox in which people prefer that others drive utilitarian vehicles designed to maximize the lives preserved in a fatal situation but want to ride in cars that prioritize the safety of passengers at all costs.[151] People disapprove of regulations that promote utilitarian views and would be less willing to purchase a self-driving car that may opt to promote the greatest good at the expense of its passengers.[151]\n\nBonnefon et al. conclude that the regulation of autonomous vehicle ethical prescriptions may be counterproductive to societal safety.[151] This is because, if the government mandates utilitarian ethics and people prefer to ride in self-protective cars, it could prevent the large scale implementation of self-driving cars.[151] Delaying the adoption of autonomous cars vitiates the safety of society as a whole because this technology is projected to save so many lives.[151] This is a paradigmatic example of the tragedy of the commons, in which rational actors cater to their self-interested preferences at the expense of societal utility.[152]\n\nTesting [ edit ]\n\nTo make a car 95% as safe as an experienced driver, 275 million failure-free autonomous miles (400 M km) are needed while several billions miles (or kilometers) are needed to make them 10% or 20% safer than humans.[153]\n\nThe testing of vehicles with varying degrees of automation can be carried out either physically, in a closed environment[154] or, where permitted, on public roads (typically requiring a license or permit,[155] or adhering to a specific set of operating principles),[156] or in a virtual environment, i.e. using computer simulations.[157][158] When driven on public roads, automated vehicles require a person to monitor their proper operation and ""take over"" when needed. For example, New York state has strict requirements for the test driver, such that the vehicle can be corrected at all times by a licensed operator; highlighted by Cardian Cube Company\'s application and discussions with New York State officials and the NYS DMV.[159]\n\nApple is testing self-driving cars, and has increased its fleet of test vehicles from three in April 2017, to 27 in January 2018, and 45 by March 2018.[160][161]\n\nRussian internet-company Yandex started to develop self-driving cars in early 2017. The first driverless prototype was launched in May 2017. In November 2017, Yandex released a video of its AV winter tests.[162] The car drove successfully along snowy roads of Moscow. In June 2018, Yandex self-driving vehicle completed a 485-mile (780 km) trip on a federal highway from Moscow to Kazan in autonomous mode.[163][164] In August 2018, Yandex launched a Europe\'s first robotaxi service with no human driver behind the wheel in the Russian town of Innopolis.[165] At the beginning of 2020 it was reported that over 5,000 autonomous passenger rides were made in the city.[166] At the end of 2018, Yandex obtained a license to operate autonomous vehicles on public roads in the U.S. state of Nevada. In 2019 and 2020, Yandex cars carried out demo rides for Consumer Electronic Show visitors in Las Vegas. Yandex cars were circulating the streets of the city without any human control.[167][168] In 2019 Yandex started testing its self-driving cars on the public roads of Israel.[169] In October 2019, Yandex became one of the companies selected by Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) to provide autonomous passenger rides to the visitors of Detroit Autoshow 2020.[170] At the end of 2019, Yandex made an announcement its self-driving cars passed 1 million miles in fully autonomous mode in Russia, Israel, and the United States.[171] In February 2020, Yandex doubled its mileage with 2 million miles passed.[172] In 2020, Yandex started to test its self-driving cars in Michigan.[173]\n\nThe progress of automated vehicles can be assessed by computing the average distance driven between ""disengagements"", when the automated system is switched off, typically by the intervention of a human driver. In 2017, Waymo reported 63 disengagements over 352,545 mi (567,366 km) of testing, an average distance of 5,596 mi (9,006 km) between disengagements, the highest among companies reporting such figures. Waymo also traveled a greater total distance than any of the other companies. Their 2017 rate of 0.18 disengagements per 1,000 mi (1,600 km) was an improvement over the 0.2 disengagements per 1,000 mi (1,600 km) in 2016, and 0.8 in 2015. In March 2017, Uber reported an average of just 0.67 mi (1.08 km) per disengagement. In the final three months of 2017, Cruise (now owned by GM) averaged 5,224 mi (8,407 km) per disengagement over a total distance of 62,689 mi (100,888 km).[174] In July 2018, the first electric driverless racing car, ""Robocar"", completed a 1.8-kilometer track, using its navigation system and artificial intelligence.[175]\n\nDistance between disengagement and total distance traveled autonomously Car maker California, 2016[174] California, 2018[176] California, 2019[177] Distance between\n\ndisengagements Total distance traveled Distance between\n\ndisengagements Total distance traveled Distance between\n\ndisengagements Total distance traveled Waymo 5,128 mi (8,253 km) 635,868 mi (1,023,330 km) 11,154 mi (17,951 km) 1,271,587 mi (2,046,421 km) 11,017 mi (17,730 km) 1,450,000 mi (2,330,000 km) BMW 638 mi (1,027 km) 638 mi (1,027 km) Nissan 263 mi (423 km) 6,056 mi (9,746 km) 210 mi (340 km) 5,473 mi (8,808 km) Ford 197 mi (317 km) 590 mi (950 km) General Motors 55 mi (89 km) 8,156 mi (13,126 km) 5,205 mi (8,377 km) 447,621 mi (720,376 km) 12,221 mi (19,668 km) 831,040 mi (1,337,430 km) Delphi Automotive Systems 15 mi (24 km) 2,658 mi (4,278 km) Tesla 3 mi (4.8 km) 550 mi (890 km) Mercedes-Benz 2 mi (3.2 km) 673 mi (1,083 km) 1.5 mi (2.4 km) 1,749 mi (2,815 km) Bosch 7 mi (11 km) 983 mi (1,582 km) Zoox 1,923 mi (3,095 km) 30,764 mi (49,510 km) 1,595 mi (2,567 km) 67,015 mi (107,850 km) Nuro 1,028 mi (1,654 km) 24,680 mi (39,720 km) 2,022 mi (3,254 km) 68,762 mi (110,662 km) Pony.ai 1,022 mi (1,645 km) 16,356 mi (26,322 km) 6,476 mi (10,422 km) 174,845 mi (281,386 km) Baidu (Apolong) 206 mi (332 km) 18,093 mi (29,118 km) 18,050 mi (29,050 km) 108,300 mi (174,300 km) Aurora 100 mi (160 km) 32,858 mi (52,880 km) 280 mi (450 km) 39,729 mi (63,938 km) Apple 1.1 mi (1.8 km) 79,745 mi (128,337 km) 118 mi (190 km) 7,544 mi (12,141 km) Uber 0.4 mi (0.64 km) 26,899 mi (43,290 km) 0 mi (0 km)\n\nApplications [ edit ]\n\nAutonomous trucks and vans [ edit ]\n\nCompanies such as Otto and Starsky Robotics have focused on autonomous trucks. Automation of trucks is important, not only due to the improved safety aspects of these very heavy vehicles, but also due to the ability of fuel savings through platooning. Autonomous vans are being used by online grocers such as Ocado.[citation needed]\n\nResearch has also indicated that goods distribution on the macro (urban distribution) and micro level (last mile delivery) could be made more efficient with the use of autonomous vehicles [178] thanks to the possibility of smaller vehicle sizes.\n\nTransport systems [ edit ]\n\nChina trialed the first automated public bus in Henan province in 2015, on a highway linking Zhengzhou and Kaifeng.[179][180] Baidu and King Long produce automated minibus, a vehicle with 14 seats, but without driving seat. With 100 vehicles produced, 2018 will be the first year with commercial automated service in China.[181][182]\n\nIn Europe, cities in Belgium, France, Italy and the UK are planning to operate transport systems for automated cars,[183][184][185] and Germany, the Netherlands, and Spain have allowed public testing in traffic. In 2015, the UK launched public trials of the LUTZ Pathfinder automated pod in Milton Keynes.[186] Beginning in summer 2015, the French government allowed PSA Peugeot-Citroen to make trials in real conditions in the Paris area. The experiments were planned to be extended to other cities such as Bordeaux and Strasbourg by 2016.[187] The alliance between French companies THALES and Valeo (provider of the first self-parking car system that equips Audi and Mercedes premi) is testing its own system.[188] New Zealand is planning to use automated vehicles for public transport in Tauranga and Christchurch.[189][190][191][192]\n\nImpact [ edit ]\n\nAutomobile industry [ edit ]\n\nThe traditional automobile industry is subject to changes driven by technology and market demands. These changes include breakthrough technological advances and when the market demands and adopts new technology quickly. In the rapid advance of both factors, the end of the era of incremental change was recognized. When the transition is made to new technology, new entrants to the automotive industry present themselves, which can be distinguished as mobility providers such as Uber and Lyft, as well as tech giants such as Google and Nvidia.[193] As new entrants to the industry arise, market uncertainty naturally occurs due to the changing dynamics. For example, the entrance of tech giants, as well as the alliances between them and traditional car manufacturers causes a variation in the innovation and production process of autonomous vehicles. Additionally, the entrance of mobility providers has caused ambiguous user preferences. As a result of the rise of mobility providers, the number of vehicles per capita has flatlined. In addition, the rise of the sharing economy also contributes to market uncertainty and causes forecasters to question whether personal ownership of vehicles is still relevant as new transportation technology and mobility providers are becoming preferred among consumers.\n\nTo help reduce the possibility of safety issues, some companies have begun to open-source parts of their driverless systems. Udacity for instance is developing an open-source software stack,[194] and some companies are having similar approaches.[195][196]\n\nHealth [ edit ]\n\nAccording to a 2020 Annual Review of Public Health review of the literature, self-driving cars ""could increase some health risks (such as air pollution, noise, and sedentarism); however, if properly regulated, AVs will likely reduce morbidity and mortality from motor vehicle crashes and may help reshape cities to promote healthy urban environments.""[197] Driving safety experts predict that once driverless technology has been fully developed, traffic collisions (and resulting deaths and injuries and costs) caused by human error, such as delayed reaction time, tailgating, rubbernecking, and other forms of distracted or aggressive driving should be substantially reduced.[1][198][199][200][201] With the increasing reliance of autonomous vehicles on interconnectivity and the availability of big data which is made usable in the form of real-time maps, driving decisions can be made much faster in order to prevent collisions.[8]\n\nNumbers made available by the US government state that 94% of vehicle accidents are due to human failures.[202] As a result, major implications for the healthcare industry become apparent. Numbers from the National Safety Council on killed and injured people on US roads multiplied by the average costs of a single incident reveal that an estimated US$500 billion loss may be imminent for the US healthcare industry when autonomous vehicles are dominating the roads. It is likely the anticipated decrease in traffic accidents will positively contribute to the widespread acceptance of autonomous vehicles, as well as the possibility to better allocate healthcare resources. If 90% of cars in the US became self-driving, for example, an estimated 25,000 lives would be saved annually. Lives saved by averting automobile crashes in the US has been valued at more than $200 billion annually.[197]\n\nSelf-driving car would have the potential to save 10 million lives worldwide, per decade.[203][197]\n\nAccording to motorist website ""TheDrive.com"" operated by Time magazine, none of the driving safety experts they were able to contact was able to rank driving under an autopilot system at the time (2017) as having achieved a greater level of safety than traditional fully hands-on driving, so the degree to which these benefits asserted by proponents will manifest in practice cannot be assessed.[204] Confounding factors that could reduce the net effect on safety may include unexpected interactions between humans and partly or fully automated vehicles, or between different types of a vehicle system; complications at the boundaries of functionality at each automation level (such as handover when the vehicle reaches the limit of its capacity); the effect of the bugs and flaws that inevitably occur in complex interdependent software systems; sensor or data shortcomings; and successful compromise by malicious interveners. Security problems include what an autonomous car might do if summoned to pick up the owner but another person attempts entry, what happens if someone tries to break into the car, and what happens if someone attacks the occupants, for example by exchanging gunfire.[205]\n\nSome[who?] believe that once automation in vehicles reaches higher levels and becomes reliable, drivers will pay less attention to the road.[206] Research shows that drivers in automated cars react later when they have to intervene in a critical situation, compared to if they were driving manually.[207] Depending on the capabilities of automated vehicles and the frequency with which human intervention is needed, this may counteract any increase in safety, as compared to all-human driving, that may be delivered by other factors.\n\nAn unexpected disadvantage of the widespread acceptance of autonomous vehicles would be a reduction in the supply of organs for donation.[208] In the US, for example, 13% of the organ donation supply comes from car crash victims.[197]\n\nWelfare [ edit ]\n\nAccording to a 2020 study, self-driving cars will increase productivity, and housing affordability, as well as reclaim land used for parking.[209] However, self-driving cars will cause greater energy use, traffic congestion and sprawl.[209] Automated cars could reduce labor costs;[210][211] relieve travelers from driving and navigation chores, thereby replacing behind-the-wheel commuting hours with more time for leisure or work;[198][201] and also would lift constraints on occupant ability to drive, distracted and texting while driving, intoxicated, prone to seizures, or otherwise impaired.[212][213][214]\n\nFor the young, the elderly, people with disabilities, and low-income citizens, automated cars could provide enhanced mobility.[215][216] The removal of the steering wheel\xe2\x80\x94along with the remaining driver interface and the requirement for any occupant to assume a forward-facing position\xe2\x80\x94would give the interior of the cabin greater ergonomic flexibility. Large vehicles, such as motorhomes, would attain appreciably enhanced ease of use.[217]\n\nThe elderly and persons with disabilities (such as persons who are hearing-impaired, vision-impaired, mobility-impaired, or cognitively-impaired) are potential beneficiaries of adoption of autonomous vehicles; however, the extent to which such populations gain greater mobility from the adoption of AV technology depends on the specific designs and regulations adopted.[218][219]\n\nChildren and teens, who are not able to drive a vehicle themselves in case of student transport, would also benefit of the introduction of autonomous cars.[220] Daycares and schools are able to come up with automated pick-up and drop-off systems by car in addition to walking, cycling and busing, causing a decrease of reliance on parents and childcare workers.\n\nThe extent to which human actions are necessary for driving will vanish. Since current vehicles require human actions to some extent, the driving school industry will not be disrupted until the majority of autonomous transportation is switched to the emerged dominant design. It is plausible that in the distant future driving a vehicle will be considered as a luxury, which implies that the structure of the industry is based on new entrants and a new market.[221] Self-driving cars would also exasperate existing mobility inequalities driven by the interests of car companies and technology companies while taking investment away from more equitable and sustainable mobility initiatives such as public transportation.[222]\n\nUrban planning [ edit ]\n\nAccording to a Wonkblog reporter, if fully automated cars become commercially available, they have the potential to be a disruptive innovation with major implications for society. The likelihood of widespread adoption is still unclear, but if they are used on a wide scale, policymakers face a number of unresolved questions about their effects.[118]\n\nOne fundamental question is about their effect on travel behavior. Some people believe that they will increase car ownership and car use because it will become easier to use them and they will ultimately be more useful.[118] This may, in turn, encourage urban sprawl and ultimately total private vehicle use. Others argue that it will be easier to share cars and that this will thus discourage outright ownership and decrease total usage, and make cars more efficient forms of transportation in relation to the present situation.[99][223]\n\nPolicy-makers will have to take a new look at how infrastructure is to be built and how money will be allotted to build for automated vehicles. The need for traffic signals could potentially be reduced with the adoption of smart highways.[224] Due to smart highways and with the assistance of smart technological advances implemented by policy change, the dependence on oil imports may be reduced because of less time being spent on the road by individual cars which could have an effect on policy regarding energy.[225] On the other hand, automated vehicles could increase the overall number of cars on the road which could lead to a greater dependence on oil imports if smart systems are not enough to curtail the impact of more vehicles.[226] However, due to the uncertainty of the future of automated vehicles, policymakers may want to plan effectively by implementing infrastructure improvements that can be beneficial to both human drivers and automated vehicles.[227] Caution needs to be taken in acknowledgment to public transportation and that the use may be greatly reduced if automated vehicles are catered to through policy reform of infrastructure with this resulting in job loss and increased unemployment.[228]\n\nOther disruptive effects will come from the use of automated vehicles to carry goods. Self-driving vans have the potential to make home deliveries significantly cheaper, transforming retail commerce and possibly making hypermarkets and supermarkets redundant. As of 2019 the US Department of Transportation defines automation into six levels, starting at level zero which means the human driver does everything and ending with level five, the automated system performs all the driving tasks. Also under the current law, manufacturers bear all the responsibility to self-certify vehicles for use on public roads. This means that currently as long as the vehicle is compliant within the regulatory framework, there are no specific federal legal barriers in the US to a highly automated vehicle being offered for sale. Iyad Rahwan, an associate professor in the MIT Media Lab said, ""Most people want to live in a world where cars will minimize casualties, but everyone wants their own car to protect them at all costs."" Furthermore, industry standards and best practice are still needed in systems before they can be considered reasonably safe under real-world conditions.[229]\n\nTraffic [ edit ]\n\nAdditional advantages could include higher speed limits;[230] smoother rides;[231] and increased roadway capacity; and minimized traffic congestion, due to decreased need for safety gaps and higher speeds.[232][233] Currently, maximum controlled-access highway throughput or capacity according to the US Highway Capacity Manual is about 2,200 passenger vehicles per hour per lane, with about 5% of the available road space is taken up by cars. One study estimated that automated cars could increase capacity by 273% (\xe2\x89\x888,200 cars per hour per lane). The study also estimated that with 100% connected vehicles using vehicle-to-vehicle communication, capacity could reach 12,000 passenger vehicles per hour (up 545% from 2,200 pc/h per lane) traveling safely at 120 km/h (75 mph) with a following gap of about 6 m (20 ft) of each other. Human drivers at highway speeds keep between 40 to 50 m (130 to 160 ft) away from the vehicle in front. These increases in highway capacity could have a significant impact in traffic congestion, particularly in urban areas, and even effectively end highway congestion in some places.[234] The ability for authorities to manage traffic flow would increase, given the extra data and driving behavior predictability[235] combined with less need for traffic police and even road signage.\n\nInsurance [ edit ]\n\nSafer driving is expected to reduce the costs of vehicle insurance.[210][236][failed verification] The automobile insurance industry might suffer as the technology makes certain aspects of these occupations obsolete.[216] As fewer collisions implicate less money spent on repair costs, the role of the insurance industry is likely to be altered as well. It can be expected that the increased safety of transport due to autonomous vehicles will lead to a decrease in payouts for the insurers, which is positive for the industry, but fewer payouts may imply a demand drop for insurances in general.\n\nIn order to accommodate such changes, the Automated and Electric Vehicles Act 2018 was introduced. While Part 2 deals with Electric Vehicles, Part 1 covers insurance provisions for automated vehicles.\n\nLabor market [ edit ]\n\nA direct impact of widespread adoption of automated vehicles is the loss of driving-related jobs in the road transport industry.[1][210][211][237] There could be resistance from professional drivers and unions who are threatened by job losses.[238] In addition, there could be job losses in public transit services and crash repair shops. A frequently cited paper by Michael Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey found that automated cars would make many jobs redundant.[239] The industry has, however created thousands of jobs in low-income countries for workers who train autonomous systems.[240]\n\nEnergy and environmental impacts [ edit ]\n\nVehicle use\n\nA review found that private autonomous vehicles may increase total travel, whereas autonomous buses may lead to reduced car use.[241]\n\nVehicle automation can improve fuel economy of the car by optimizing the drive cycle, as well as increasing congested traffic speeds by an estimated 8%-13%.[242][243] Reduced traffic congestion and the improvements in traffic flow due to widespread use of automated cars will translate into higher fuel efficiency, ranging from a 23%-39% increase, with the potential to further increase.[242][244] Additionally, self-driving cars will be able to accelerate and brake more efficiently, meaning higher fuel economy from reducing wasted energy typically associated with inefficient changes to speed. However, the improvement in vehicle energy efficiency does not necessarily translate to net reduction in energy consumption and positive environmental outcomes.\n\nAlongside the induced demand, there may also be a reduction in the use of more sustainable modes, such as public or active transport. It is expected that convenience of the automated vehicles encourages the consumers to travel more, and this induced demand may partially or fully offset the fuel efficiency improvement brought by automation.[243] Alongside the induced demand, there may also be a reduction in the use of more sustainable modes, such as public or active transport.[245] Overall, the consequences of vehicle automation on global energy demand and emissions are highly uncertain, and heavily depends on the combined effect of changes in consumer behavior, policy intervention, technological progress and vehicle technology.[243]\n\nProduction\n\nBy reducing the labor and other costs of mobility as a service, automated cars could reduce the number of cars that are individually owned, replaced by taxi/pooling and other car-sharing services.[246][247] This would also dramatically reduce the size of the automotive production industry, with corresponding environmental and economic effects.\n\nIndirect effects\n\nThe lack of stressful driving, more productive time during the trip, and the potential savings in travel time and cost could become an incentive to live far away from cities, where housing is cheaper, and work in the city\'s core, thus increasing travel distances and inducing more urban sprawl, raising energy consumption and enlarging the carbon footprint of urban travel.[243][248][249] There is also the risk that traffic congestion might increase, rather than decrease.[243][216] Appropriate public policies and regulations, such as zoning, pricing, and urban design are required to avoid the negative impacts of increased suburbanization and longer distance travel.[216][249]\n\nSince many autonomous vehicles are going to rely on electricity to operate, the demand for lithium batteries increases. Similarly, radar, sensors, lidar, and high-speed internet connectivity require higher auxiliary power from vehicles, which manifests as greater power draw from batteries.[243] The larger battery requirement causes a necessary increase in the supply of these type of batteries for the chemical industry. On the other hand, with the expected increase of battery-powered (autonomous) vehicles, the petroleum industry is expected to undergo a decline in demand. As this implication depends on the adoption rate of autonomous vehicles, it is unsure to what extent this implication will disrupt this particular industry. This transition phase of oil to electricity allows companies to explore whether there are business opportunities for them in the new energy ecosystem. In 2020, Mohan, Sripad, Vaishnav & Viswanathan at Carnegie Mellon University[250] found that the electricity consumption of all the automation technology, including sensors, computation, internet access as well as the increased drag from sensors causes up to a 15% impact on the range of an automated electric vehicle, therefore, implying that the larger battery requirement might not be as large as previously assumed.\n\nA study conducted by AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety found that drivers did not trust self-parking technology, even though the systems outperformed drivers with a backup camera. The study tested self-parking systems in a variety of vehicles (Lincoln MKC, Mercedes-Benz ML400 4Matic, Cadillac CTS-V Sport, BMW i3 and Jeep Cherokee Limited) and found that self-parking cars hit the curb 81% fewer times, used 47% fewer manoeuvres and parked 10% faster than drivers. Yet, only 25% of those surveyed said they would trust this technology.[251]\n\nParking space [ edit ]\n\nManually driven vehicles are reported to be used only 4\xe2\x80\x935% of the time, and being parked and unused for the remaining 95\xe2\x80\x9396% of the time.[252][253] Autonomous taxis could, on the other hand, be used continuously after they have reached their destination. This could dramatically reduce the need for parking space. For example, in Los Angeles a 2015 study found 14% of the land is used for parking alone, equivalent to some 1,702 hectares (4,210 acres).[254][255] This combined with the potential reduced need for road space due to improved traffic flow, could free up large amounts of land in urban areas, which could then be used for parks, recreational areas, buildings, among other uses; making cities more livable. Besides this, privately owned self-driving cars, also capable of self-parking would provide another advantage: the ability to drop off and pick up passengers even in places where parking is prohibited. This would benefit park and ride facilities.[256]\n\nPrivacy [ edit ]\n\nThe vehicles\' increased awareness could aid the police by reporting on illegal passenger behaviour, while possibly enabling other crimes, such as deliberately crashing into another vehicle or a pedestrian.[257] However, this may also lead to much-expanded mass surveillance if there is wide access granted to third parties to the large data sets generated.\n\nPrivacy could be an issue when having the vehicle\'s location and position integrated into an interface that other people have access to.[1][258] Moreover, they require a sensor-based infrastructure that would constitute an all-encompassing surveillance apparatus.[259] This gives the car manufacturers and other companies the data needed to understand the user\'s lifestyle and personal preferences.[260]\n\nTerrorist scenarios [ edit ]\n\nThere is the risk of terrorist attacks by automotive hacking through the sharing of information through V2V (Vehicle to Vehicle) and V2I (Vehicle to Infrastructure) protocols.[261][262][263] Self-driving cars could potentially be loaded with explosives and used as bombs.[264] According to legislation of US lawmakers, autonomous and self-driving vehicles should be equipped with defences against hacking.[265]\n\nTaxis [ edit ]\n\nWith the aforementioned ambiguous user preference regarding the personal ownership of autonomous vehicles, it is possible that the current mobility provider trend will continue as it rises in popularity. Established providers such as Uber and Lyft are already significantly present within the industry, and it is likely that new entrants will enter when business opportunities arise.[266]\n\nCar repair [ edit ]\n\nAs collisions are less likely to occur, and the risk for human errors is reduced significantly, the repair industry will face an enormous reduction of work that has to be done on the reparation of car frames. Meanwhile, as the generated data of the autonomous vehicle is likely to predict when certain replaceable parts are in need of maintenance, car owners and the repair industry will be able to proactively replace a part that will fail soon. This ""Asset Efficiency Service"" would implicate a productivity gain for the automotive repair industry.\n\nRescue, emergency response, and military [ edit ]\n\nThe technique used in autonomous driving also ensures life savings in other industries. The implementation of autonomous vehicles with rescue, emergency response, and military applications has already led to a decrease in deaths.[citation needed] Military personnel use autonomous vehicles to reach dangerous and remote places on earth to deliver fuel, food and general supplies and even rescue people. In addition, a future implication of adopting autonomous vehicles could lead to a reduction in deployed personnel, which will lead to a decrease in injuries, since the technological development allows autonomous vehicles to become more and more autonomous. Another future implication is the reduction of emergency drivers when autonomous vehicles are deployed as fire trucks or ambulances. An advantage could be the use of real-time traffic information and other generated data to determine and execute routes more efficiently than human drivers. The time savings can be invaluable in these situations.[267]\n\nInterior design and entertainment [ edit ]\n\nWith the driver decreasingly focused on operating a vehicle, the interior design and media-entertainment industry will have to reconsider what passengers of autonomous vehicles are doing when they are on the road. Vehicles need to be redesigned, and possibly even be prepared for multipurpose usage. In practice, it will show that travellers have more time for business and/or leisure. In both cases, this gives increasing opportunities for the media-entertainment industry to demand attention. Moreover, the advertisement business is able to provide location-based ads without risking driver safety.[268]\n\nTelecommunication [ edit ]\n\nAll cars can benefit from information and connections, but autonomous cars ""Will be fully capable of operating without C-V2X.""[269] In addition, the earlier mentioned entertainment industry is also highly dependent on this network to be active in this market segment. This implies higher revenues for the telecommunication industry.\n\nHospitality industry and airlines [ edit ]\n\nDriver interactions with the vehicle will be less common within the near future, and in the more distant future, the responsibility will lie entirely with the vehicle. As indicated above, this will have implications for the entertainment- and interior design industry. For roadside restaurants, the implication will be that the need for customers to stop driving and enter the restaurant will vanish, and the autonomous vehicle will have a double function. Moreover, accompanied by the rise of disruptive platforms such as Airbnb that have shaken up the hotel industry, the fast increase of developments within the autonomous vehicle industry might cause another implication for their customer bases. In the more distant future, the implication for motels might be that a decrease in guests will occur, since autonomous vehicles could be redesigned as fully equipped bedrooms. The improvements regarding the interior of the vehicles might additionally have implications for the airline industry. In the case of relatively short-haul flights, waiting times at customs or the gate imply lost time and hassle for customers. With the improved convenience in future car travel, it is possible that customers might go for this option, causing a loss in customer bases for the airline industry.[270]\n\nIncidents [ edit ]\n\nTesla Autopilot [ edit ]\n\nIn mid\xe2\x80\x91October 2015, Tesla Motors rolled out version 7 of their software in the US that included Tesla Autopilot capability.[271] On 9 January 2016, Tesla rolled out version 7.1 as an over-the-air update, adding a new ""summon"" feature that allows cars to retrieve or self-park at parking locations without the driver in the car.[272] As of November 2020 , Tesla\'s automated driving features is currently classified as a Level 2 driver assistance system according to the Society of Automotive Engineers\' (SAE) five levels of vehicle automation.[55] At this level the car can be automated but requires the full attention of the driver, who must be prepared to take control at a moment\'s notice;[273][274][275][276] Autopilot will sometimes fail to detect lane markings and disengage itself while alerting the driver.[277]\n\nOn 20 January 2016, the first of five known fatal crashes of a Tesla with Autopilot occurred in China\'s Hubei province.[278] According to China\'s 163.com news channel, this marked ""China\'s first accidental death due to Tesla\'s automatic driving (system)"". Initially, Tesla pointed out that the vehicle was so badly damaged from the impact that their recorder was not able to conclusively prove that the car had been on Autopilot at the time; however, 163.com pointed out that other factors, such as the car\'s absolute failure to take any evasive actions prior to the high speed crash, and the driver\'s otherwise good driving record, seemed to indicate a strong likelihood that the car was on Autopilot at the time. A similar fatal crash occurred four months later in Florida.[279][280] In 2018, in a subsequent civil suit between the father of the driver killed and Tesla, Tesla did not deny that the car had been on Autopilot at the time of the accident, and sent evidence to the victim\'s father documenting that fact.[281]\n\nThe second known fatal accident involving a vehicle being driven by itself took place in Williston, Florida on 7 May 2016 while a Tesla Model S electric car was engaged in Autopilot mode. The occupant was killed in a crash with an 18-wheel tractor-trailer. On 28 June 2016 the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened a formal investigation into the accident working with the Florida Highway Patrol. According to NHTSA, preliminary reports indicate the crash occurred when the tractor-trailer made a left turn in front of the Tesla at an intersection on a non-controlled access highway, and the car failed to apply the brakes. The car continued to travel after passing under the truck\'s trailer.[282][283] NHTSA\'s preliminary evaluation was opened to examine the design and performance of any automated driving systems in use at the time of the crash, which involved a population of an estimated 25,000 Model S cars.[284] On 8 July 2016, NHTSA requested Tesla Motors provide the agency detailed information about the design, operation and testing of its Autopilot technology. The agency also requested details of all design changes and updates to Autopilot since its introduction, and Tesla\'s planned updates schedule for the next four months.[285]\n\nAccording to Tesla, ""neither autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor-trailer against a brightly lit sky, so the brake was not applied."" The car attempted to drive full speed under the trailer, ""with the bottom of the trailer impacting the windshield of the Model S"". Tesla also claimed that this was Tesla\'s first known autopilot death in over 130 million miles (210 million kilometers) driven by its customers with Autopilot engaged, however by this statement, Tesla was apparently refusing to acknowledge claims that the January 2016 fatality in Hubei China had also been the result of an autopilot system error. According to Tesla there is a fatality every 94 million miles (151 million kilometers) among all type of vehicles in the US[282][283][286] However, this number also includes fatalities of the crashes, for instance, of motorcycle drivers with pedestrians.[287][288]\n\nIn July 2016, the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) opened a formal investigation into the fatal accident while the Autopilot was engaged. The NTSB is an investigative body that has the power to make only policy recommendations. An agency spokesman said ""It\'s worth taking a look and seeing what we can learn from that event, so that as that automation is more widely introduced we can do it in the safest way possible.""[289] In January 2017, the NTSB released the report that concluded Tesla was not at fault; the investigation revealed that for Tesla cars, the crash rate dropped by 40 percent after Autopilot was installed.[290]\n\nWaymo [ edit ]\n\nWaymo originated as a self-driving car project within Google. In August 2012, Google announced that their vehicles had completed over 300,000 automated-driving miles (500,000 km) accident-free, typically involving about a dozen cars on the road at any given time, and that they were starting to test with single drivers instead of in pairs.[291] In late-May 2014, Google revealed a new prototype that had no steering wheel, gas pedal, or brake pedal, and was fully automated .[292] As of March 2016 , Google had test-driven their fleet in automated mode a total of 1,500,000 mi (2,400,000 km).[293] In December 2016, Google Corporation announced that its technology would be spun off to a new company called Waymo, with both Google and Waymo becoming subsidiaries of a new parent company called Alphabet.[294][295]\n\nAccording to Google\'s accident reports as of early 2016, their test cars had been involved in 14 collisions, of which other drivers were at fault 13 times, although in 2016 the car\'s software caused a crash.[296]\n\nIn June 2015, Brin confirmed that 12 vehicles had suffered collisions as of that date. Eight involved rear-end collisions at a stop sign or traffic light, two in which the vehicle was side-swiped by another driver, one in which another driver rolled through a stop sign, and one where a Google employee was controlling the car manually.[297] In July 2015, three Google employees suffered minor injuries when their vehicle was rear-ended by a car whose driver failed to brake at a traffic light. This was the first time that a collision resulted in injuries.[298] On 14 February 2016 a Google vehicle attempted to avoid sandbags blocking its path. During the maneuver it struck a bus. Google stated, ""In this case, we clearly bear some responsibility, because if our car hadn\'t moved, there wouldn\'t have been a collision.""[299][300] Google characterized the crash as a misunderstanding and a learning experience. No injuries were reported in the crash.[296]\n\nUber [ edit ]\n\nIn March 2017, an Uber test vehicle was involved in a crash in Tempe, Arizona when another car failed to yield, flipping the Uber vehicle. There were no injuries in the accident.[301]\n\nBy 22 December 2017, Uber had completed 2 million miles (3.2 million kilometers) in automated mode.[302]\n\nOn 18 March 2018, Elaine Herzberg became the first pedestrian to be killed by a self-driving car in the United States after being hit by an Uber vehicle, also in Tempe. Herzberg was crossing outside of a crosswalk, approximately 400 feet from an intersection.[303] This marks the first time an individual is known to have been killed by an autonomous vehicle.\n\nThe first death of an essentially uninvolved third party is likely to raise new questions and concerns about the safety of automated cars in general.[304] Some experts say a human driver could have avoided the fatal crash.[305] Arizona Governor Doug Ducey later suspended the company\'s ability to test and operate its automated cars on public roadways citing an ""unquestionable failure"" of the expectation that Uber make public safety its top priority.[306] Uber has pulled out of all self-driving-car testing in California as a result of the accident.[307] On 24 May 2018 the US National Transport Safety Board issued a preliminary report.[308]\n\nOn 16 September 2020, according to the BBC, the backup driver has been charged of negligent homicide, because she did not look to the road for several seconds while her television was streaming The Voice broadcast by Hulu. Uber does not face any criminal charge because in the USA there is no basis for criminal liability for the corporation. The driver is assumed to be responsible of the accident, because she was in the driver seat in capacity to avoid an accident (like in a Level 3). Trial is planned for February 2021.[309]\n\nNavya automated bus driving system [ edit ]\n\nOn 9 November 2017, a Navya automated self-driving bus with passengers was involved in a crash with a truck. The truck was found to be at fault of the crash, reversing into the stationary automated bus. The automated bus did not take evasive actions or apply defensive driving techniques such as flashing its headlights, or sounding the horn. As one passenger commented, ""The shuttle didn\'t have the ability to move back. The shuttle just stayed still.""[310]\n\nPublic opinion surveys [ edit ]\n\nIn a 2011 online survey of 2,006 US and UK consumers by Accenture, 49% said they would be comfortable using a ""driverless car"".[311]\n\nA 2012 survey of 17,400 vehicle owners by J.D. Power and Associates found 37% initially said they would be interested in purchasing a ""fully autonomous car"". However, that figure dropped to 20% if told the technology would cost US$3,000 more.[312]\n\nIn a 2012 survey of about 1,000 German drivers by automotive researcher Puls, 22% of the respondents had a positive attitude towards these cars, 10% were undecided, 44% were skeptical and 24% were hostile.[313]\n\nA 2013 survey of 1,500 consumers across 10 countries by Cisco Systems found 57% ""stated they would be likely to ride in a car controlled entirely by technology that does not require a human driver"", with Brazil, India and China the most willing to trust automated technology.[314]\n\nIn a 2014 US telephone survey by Insurance.com, over three-quarters of licensed drivers said they would at least consider buying a self-driving car, rising to 86% if car insurance were cheaper. 31.7% said they would not continue to drive once an automated car was available instead.[315]\n\nIn a February 2015 survey of top auto journalists, 46% predict that either Tesla or Daimler will be the first to the market with a fully autonomous vehicle, while (at 38%) Daimler is predicted to be the most functional, safe, and in-demand autonomous vehicle.[316]\n\nIn 2015 a questionnaire survey by Delft University of Technology explored the opinion of 5,000 people from 109 countries on automated driving. Results showed that respondents, on average, found manual driving the most enjoyable mode of driving. 22% of the respondents did not want to spend any money for a fully automated driving system. Respondents were found to be most concerned about software hacking/misuse, and were also concerned about legal issues and safety. Finally, respondents from more developed countries (in terms of lower accident statistics, higher education, and higher income) were less comfortable with their vehicle transmitting data.[317] The survey also gave results on potential consumer opinion on interest of purchasing an automated car, stating that 37% of surveyed current owners were either ""definitely"" or ""probably"" interested in purchasing an automated car.[317]\n\nIn 2016, a survey in Germany examined the opinion of 1,603 people, who were representative in terms of age, gender, and education for the German population, towards partially, highly, and fully automated cars. Results showed that men and women differ in their willingness to use them. Men felt less anxiety and more joy towards automated cars, whereas women showed the exact opposite. The gender difference towards anxiety was especially pronounced between young men and women but decreased with participants\' age.[318]\n\nIn 2016, a PwC survey, in the United States, showing the opinion of 1,584 people, highlights that ""66 percent of respondents said they think autonomous cars are probably smarter than the average human driver"". People are still worried about safety and mostly the fact of having the car hacked. Nevertheless, only 13% of the interviewees see no advantages in this new kind of cars.[319]\n\nIn 2017, Pew Research Center surveyed 4,135 US adults from 1\xe2\x80\x9315 May and found that many Americans anticipate significant impacts from various automation technologies in the course of their lifetimes\xe2\x80\x94from the widespread adoption of automated vehicles to the replacement of entire job categories with robot workers.[320]\n\nIn 2019, results from two opinion surveys of 54 and 187 US adults respectively were published. A new standardised questionnaire, the autonomous vehicle acceptance model (AVAM) was developed, including additional description to help respondents better understand the implications of different automation levels. Results showed that users were less accepting of high autonomy levels and displayed significantly lower intention to use highly autonomous vehicles. Additionally, partial autonomy (regardless of level) was perceived as requiring uniformly higher driver engagement (usage of hands, feet and eyes) than full autonomy.[321]\n\nRegulation [ edit ]\n\nThe Geneva Convention on Road Traffic subscribed to by over 101 countries worldwide, requires the driver to be 18 years old.\n\nThe 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, subscribed to by over 70 countries worldwide, establishes principles to govern traffic laws. One of the fundamental principles of the convention has been the concept that a driver is always fully in control and responsible for the behavior of a vehicle in traffic.[322] In 2016, a reform of the convention has open possibilities for automated features. The progress of technology that assists and takes over the functions of the driver is undermining this principle, implying that much of the groundwork must be rewritten.[citation needed]\n\nThis means that in those countries cars might be automated or autonomous or self-driving but not driver-less.\n\nLegislation in Japan [ edit ]\n\nIn 2019, Japan amended two laws, ""Road Traffic Act"" and ""Road Transport Vehicle Act"",[323] and they came into effect in April 2020. In the former act, Level 3 self driving cars became allowed on public roads.[324] In the latter act, process to designate types for safety certification on Level 3 self driving function of Autonomous Driving System (ADS) and the certification process for the asserted type were legally defined.[325] Through the amendment process, the achievements from the national project ""SIP-adus"" led by Cabinet Office since 2014 were fully considered and accepted.[326]\n\nIn 2020, the next stage national level roadmap plan was officially issued which had considered social deployment and acceptability of Level 4.[327][328]\n\nIn 2021, National Police Agency published its committee report of FY 2020 on summary of issues in research to realize Level 4 mobility services, including required legal amendment issues.[329][330]\n\nLegal status in the United States [ edit ]\n\nUS states that allow testing of autonomous vehicles on public roads as of June 2018\n\nIn the United States, a non-signatory country to the Vienna Convention, state vehicle codes generally do not envisage\xe2\x80\x94but do not necessarily prohibit\xe2\x80\x94highly automated vehicles as of 2012 .[331][332] To clarify the legal status of and otherwise regulate such vehicles, several states have enacted or are considering specific laws.[333] By 2016, seven states (Nevada, California, Florida, Michigan, Hawaii, Washington, and Tennessee), along with the District of Columbia, have enacted laws for automated vehicles. Incidents such as the first fatal accident by Tesla\'s Autopilot system have led to discussion about revising laws and standards for automated cars.\n\nFederal policies [ edit ]\n\nIn September 2016, the US National Economic Council and US Department of Transportation (USDOT) released the Federal Automated Vehicles Policy,[334] which are standards that describe how automated vehicles should react if their technology fails, how to protect passenger privacy, and how riders should be protected in the event of an accident. The new federal guidelines are meant to avoid a patchwork of state laws, while avoiding being so overbearing as to stifle innovation.[335] Since then, USDOT has released multiple updates:\n\nAutomated Driving Systems: A Vision for Safety 2.0 (12 September 2017) [336]\n\n(12 September 2017) Preparing for the Future of Transportation: Automated Vehicles 3.0 (4 October 2018) [337]\n\n(4 October 2018) Ensuring American Leadership in Automated Vehicle Technologies: Automated Vehicles 4.0 (8 January 2020)[338]\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration released for public comment the Occupant Protection for Automated Driving System on 30 March 2020,[339] followed by the Framework for Automated Driving System Safety on 3 December 2020.[340] Occupant Protection is intended to modernize the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards considering the removal of manual controls with automated driving systems,[341] while the Framework document is intended to provide an objective way to define and assess automated driving system competence to ensure motor vehicle safety while also remaining flexible to accommodate the development of features to improve safety.[342]\n\nState policies [ edit ]\n\nNevada\n\nIn June 2011, the Nevada Legislature passed a law to authorize the use of automated cars. Nevada thus became the first jurisdiction in the world where automated vehicles might be legally operated on public roads. According to the law, the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles is responsible for setting safety and performance standards and the agency is responsible for designating areas where automated cars may be tested.[343][344][345] This legislation was supported by Google in an effort to legally conduct further testing of its Google driverles'";"Autonomous Cars";"200.txt-Autonomous Cars"

Read on to see how they differ.\n\nDriver Support\n\nDriver support technology reduces the workload on the driver. Today, most automakers sell various driver support systems, either as standard equipment or as options on their cars. These include intelligent or adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assists, and hands-free capability.\n\nAutonomous Systems\n\nAutonomous systems do the driving for you. No automaker today sells a true autonomous system, but some are pushing toward that technology. One such project underway is Waymo, a sister company to Google, that is testing autonomous rideshare vehicles in Phoenix using converted Chrysler Pacifica minivans.\n\nRELATED STORIES: Report: Apple Self-Driving Car Coming by 2024\n\nSix Levels of Self-Driving Technology\n\nSAE International, a global association of engineers and related technical experts in the aerospace, automotive, and commercial-vehicle industries, has laid out a useful framework for thinking about self-driving systems. They sort the technologies into six levels, labeled zero through five (okay, even automotive engineers don\xe2\x80\x99t always do the logical thing).\n\nHowever, not every level is classified as autonomous driving.

Even if it uses sensors to warn you of surrounding traffic, like a blind-spot alert system or a lane-departure warning, it still has no self-driving capability to correct or counter the perceived threat.\n\nLevel 1\n\nAt Level 1, your car can intervene slightly in your driving in an attempt to keep you safe. A lane-keeping system that helps steer to center you in a lane is a Level 1 technology.\n\nRELATED STORIES: What is Adaptive Cruise Control?\n\nLevel 2\n\nAt Level 2, features communicate with one another, and more than one can be active simultaneously. An example of this autonomous technology is an adaptive cruise control system that adjusts your speed to keep you a certain distance from the car ahead while centering the car in its lane.\n\nCurrently, Level 2 systems are the most sophisticated technology sold on cars in America. Some automakers describe these systems in ways that make them seem more advanced than Level 2 standards because they allow drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel briefly. However, all these systems require drivers to keep their eyes focused ahead. Drivers need to be ready at all times to take over control of the car at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice.\n\nLevel 3\n\nAt Level 3, the car can drive itself under limited conditions, but the driver must remain aware and prepared to take over. Automakers have tested Level 3 systems that will allow the driver to take their hands off the wheel in a traffic jam, for instance, but prompt the driver to take over when the congestion eases.\n\nAccording to Honda and a few other reputable sites, the Honda 100 Legend Flagship car is the first Level 3 autonomous car. Right now, it\xe2\x80\x99s only available in Japan for leasing. It was released on March 5, 2021.\n\nThere are no Level 3 systems currently sold to consumers in the U.S.\n\nLevel 4\n\nAt Level 4, the car can drive itself in a fixed loop on known roads. The rider is not required to take over driving at any time. These vehicles may or may not have a steering wheel or pedals. In some places, Level 4 driverless rideshare vehicles (like Waymo\xe2\x80\x99s) are in limited testing. But they are not yet approved for general use in any state.\n\nLevel 5\n\nAt Level 5, the car can drive itself under any conditions and on any road. These vehicles do not have steering wheels or pedals. At this point, Level 5 systems are theoretical.\n\nCan You Trust It?\n\nAll self-driving systems currently for sale in the United States are SAE Level 2 or lower. It is not safe to remove your attention from driving while behind the wheel of any car currently sold with this technology. However, it is safe to briefly remove your hands from the wheel with some Level 2 systems under certain conditions. But you should remain prepared to take over the driving at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice.\n\nTesla advertises its automation systems more aggressively than any other U.S. automaker. Still, its advertising materials flatly state, \xe2\x80\x9cAutopilot and Full Self-Driving Capability are intended for use with a fully attentive driver, who has their hands on the wheel and is prepared to take over at any moment. While these features are designed to become more capable over time, the currently enabled features do not make the vehicle autonomous.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDo You Still Need to Pay Attention to the Road?\n\nYes. Always. Even when using driving assist technology in Levels 0 to 3, it\xe2\x80\x99s required that you always keep your eyes on the road.\n\nHowever, when using low-speed applications, including self-parking features, keeping your eyes on the road or staying inside the vehicle may not be needed. For example, some luxury brands offer a self-parking remote that handles this maneuver for things like parallel parking.\n\nWhich Cars Have Self-Driving Capability?\n\nVirtually every automaker selling cars in the U.S. today offers driver-assistance systems that can reduce the workload on the driver. These include adaptive cruise control that can adjust speed to maintain distance from the car ahead or automatic emergency braking that can slow or stop the car to avoid hitting a vehicle or pedestrian or reduce the severity of a crash.\n\nNone of these systems are so reliable that the driver can take their attention from the task of driving, though.\n\nMany manufacturers currently market systems up to and including Level 2 automation. This approach combines adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assist into a system that requires that the driver keep their hands on the wheel but relieves some of the driver\xe2\x80\x99s workload.\n\nA prime example is cruise control with stop-and-go capability that allows the driver to negotiate heavy traffic without using the pedals.\n\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s a breakdown of what to expect from several of them.\n\nNissan ProPILOT\n\nNissan markets this as ProPILOT, \xe2\x80\x9ca hands-on driver-assist system that combines Nissan\xe2\x80\x99s Intelligent Cruise Control and Steering Assist technologies and includes a stop and hold function that can bring the vehicle to a full stop, hold in place, and can bring you back up to speed when traffic starts moving again.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNewer versions use the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s navigation system information to slow for curves ahead and prompt the driver to adjust for posted speed limits. While it will keep the car centered in its lane, it will not steer the car through curves like Kia\xe2\x80\x99s, Ford\xe2\x80\x99s, GM\xe2\x80\x99s, or Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s systems.\n\nSubaru EyeSight\n\nSubaru\xe2\x80\x99s EyeSight system does much the same. It also has a pre-collision braking system that alerts the driver to an impending crash and applies full braking power to try to prevent it.\n\nVolvo Pilot Assist\n\nVolvo\xe2\x80\x99s Pilot Assist allows the driver to set a preferred speed and preferred distance from the vehicle ahead. It can then change speed to maintain that distance and keep the car centered in its lane. But Pilot Assist will warn the driver audibly and shut itself off if the road starts to curve or if it detects that the driver has removed their hands from the wheel.\n\nMercedes-Benz Distronic Plus with Steering Assist\n\nMercedes-Benz\xe2\x80\x99s Distronic Plus with Steering Assist also combines adaptive cruise control with a lane-centering system. In keeping with Mercedes\xe2\x80\x99 autobahn image, it functions at up to 120 mph and warns drivers if they are about to be passed.\n\nAnother feature, called Parktronic, allows drivers to follow the car\xe2\x80\x99s commands under 20 mph as it self-parks the vehicle. The driver keeps control of the car with the gas and brake pedals. The driver just needs to put the car in drive or reverse as it drives and steers itself into a parking space.\n\nTesla Autopilot and Full Self-Driving\n\nTesla markets its evolving suite of self-driving technologies more aggressively than any other automaker. This has led to some confusion as to what level of automation Tesla cars are currently capable of. The electric car company sells the systems under two names: Autopilot, and Full Self-Driving.\n\nEvery Tesla vehicle available in 2021 ships with the company\xe2\x80\x99s Autopilot system enabled. Autopilot is a traffic-aware cruise control system that accelerates and slows the car to match the speed of the cars around it, combined with a lane-keeping assist system that centers the car in a clearly marked lane. That\xe2\x80\x99s all it is. The marketing name \xe2\x80\x9cAutopilot\xe2\x80\x9d may make it sound considerably more advanced. But it is similar to adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assist systems offered by most automakers, like Nissan\xe2\x80\x99s ProPILOT or Subaru\xe2\x80\x99s EyeSight.\n\nOlder Teslas use torque sensors in the steering wheel to monitor the driver\xe2\x80\x99s attention level and promptly alert them if their attention seems to be waning. Newer models use a more accurate camera for the same purpose.\n\nFull Self-Driving\n\nTesla\xe2\x80\x99s Full Self-Driving is considerably more sophisticated. Despite its name, it does not possess SAE Level 5 self-driving capability. Full Self-Driving can park the car in a parking space, back it out of a parking space, and change lanes on its own at highway speeds. A more advanced system in beta testing can slow the car for stop signs and traffic lights and navigate highway on-ramps and off-ramps. Tesla regularly sends updates to this system remotely to cars currently involved in the beta test.\n\nCrucially, Full Self-Driving does not allow the driver to take their attention from the road. They may temporarily take their hands from the wheel but should be prepared to take over driving at any moment. Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s own marketing materials caution, \xe2\x80\x9cThe currently enabled Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFull Self-Driving is a costly option, even by luxury car standards. As of this writing, the Tesla self-driving price for the feature adds $10,000 to the total cost. Tesla promises to update it regularly in hopes of eventually releasing an SAE Level 5 autonomous driving system to everyone who has purchased Full Self-Driving.\n\nHowever, in a recent letter to California state regulators, Tesla said that Full Self-Driving would remain at Level 2. The company said it did \xe2\x80\x9cnot expect significant enhancements\xe2\x80\x9d that would \xe2\x80\x9cshift the responsibility for the entire dynamic driving task to the system.\xe2\x80\x9d Instead, the letter said, Full Self-Driving \xe2\x80\x9cwill continue to be an SAE Level 2, advanced driver assistance feature.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nConsumers should be aware that the company has told shoppers it will someday have Level 5 capability and has told government regulators that it would not.\n\nCheck out our YouTube videos on the Tesla Model Y and Tesla Model S\n\nGeneral Motors Super Cruise\n\nGeneral Motors offers its own advanced driver assistance system, an SAE Level 2 system called Super Cruise. Like Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s Autopilot, Super Cruise includes an adaptive cruise control that will speed up and slow down the vehicle to maintain a driver-selected distance from the vehicle ahead. It also has a lane-keeping system that tries to center the car in its lane even through curves in the road, and automatic emergency braking that brakes the car in an attempt to avert a collision.\n\nSuper Cruise requires the driver to stay alert and keep their hands near the wheel. It includes a driver monitoring system that watches the driver\xe2\x80\x99s eyes and warns them if their attention seems to be drifting from the road. GM says, \xe2\x80\x9cSuper Cruise allows the driver to drive hands-free when compatible road driving conditions allow the feature to be available. But the driver still needs to pay close attention to the road. Even while using the Super Cruise driver assistance technology, drivers should always pay attention while driving and not use a hand-held device.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSuper Cruise is currently available on most Cadillac vehicles and the Chevy Bolt and Bolt EUV electric vehicles. GM plans to extend it to parts of the Buick and GMC lineup in 2022. Super Cruise is free for the first three years but requires a subscription after that.\n\nOf note, Super Cruise works only on roads mapped by GM. The company mapped at least 200,000 miles of roads in the U.S. and Canada using lidar mapping technology.\n\nFord Blue Cruise\n\nFord and its Lincoln luxury division recently introduced their own Level 2 automation system, called Blue Cruise. Buyers can order Blue Cruise on many new Ford and Lincoln vehicles today. But the system isn\xe2\x80\x99t active yet. Ford expects to activate it late in 2021 through an over-the-air software update that will not require a visit to the dealership.\n\nLike Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s Autopilot and GM\xe2\x80\x99s Super Cruise systems, Blue Cruise pairs an adaptive cruise control with lane-keeping assistance. It allows drivers to temporarily remove their hands from the wheel while keeping their eyes on the road.\n\nBlue Cruise automatically steers the vehicle using more than 100,000 miles of pre-mapped roads stored in the system. In Blue Cruise-equipped cars, the driver\xe2\x80\x99s instrument cluster switches to a blue background when driving on a road where the system can be activated.\n\nA subscription to Blue Cruise costs $600 for three years. However, to use it, you must buy an option package that has all the necessary equipment. The cost range is $995 to $2,600, depending on the model.\n\nTraffic Jam Assists\n\nLuxury automakers have begun developing semi-autonomous driving systems specifically for use in heavy traffic. They allow the driver to relax their attention and let the car accelerate and brake to keep its place in traffic, but systems work only at lower speeds.\n\nBMW\xe2\x80\x99s Active Driving Assistant Pro, for instance, shuts off when traffic exceeds 40 mph. It will not steer the vehicle through curves.\n\nAudi is developing its own Traffic Jam Pilot that, it says, should allow drivers to remove their hands from the wheel below 37 mph. But that system has not received regulatory approval.\n\nThe Future of Self-Driving Cars\n\nEngineers from more than a dozen companies are testing self-driving systems in hopes of producing an SAE Level 5 self-driving car. It seems safe to predict that the technology is coming.\n\nBut the engineering challenge of getting there is immense. A car that can drive itself on well-maintained roads may make a critical mistake on poorly maintained roads. What if a car that can react safely to normal traffic may not react safely to unusual situations? A car that can do everything engineers ask of it may fail when presented with a problem they never considered (in one recent incident, a self-driving car in testing was baffled by a truck bed full of traffic signs being delivered to a construction site. The car had no idea what to do).\n\nBeyond the engineering challenge, 50 sets of state laws (plus the District of Columbia) must adapt to decide safety and liability issues before self-driving cars can become common.\n\nThe market will also have its say. Volkswagen recently unveiled a concept car that would charge by the mile for self-driving capability. Executives reasoned that as long as getting your car to drive you somewhere costs less than a train ticket to that same place, they could charge for using the self-driving feature. So, while some automakers hope to charge buyers upfront for automation, others may make it available for short-term rental only.\n\nLastly, there\xe2\x80\x99s the matter of marketing. It\xe2\x80\x99s already growing difficult to sort what manufacturers claim their cars can do from what they can actually do. That will only grow cloudier as the technology advances.\n\nSo, while you may be able to own a self-driving car in your lifetime, it may be further away than advancing technology would indicate.\n\nMore: Best Cars and Top 10 Lists\n\nRelated Self-Driving Stories:'";"Autonomous Cars";"202.txt-Autonomous Cars"

"205.txt";"b'Who wouldn\'t want to just press a button, have the steering wheel and pedals stowed, and let your self-driving car whisk you in cocooned comfort to your parent\'s house five hours away while you sleep, work, or play with your kids? That\'s a dream scenario self-driving cars promise. Proponents say there would be no more crashes, no more drunk driving, no more traffic. It\'s tantalizing to think that cars will one day be able to drive us. It can also be terrifying to others who fear letting go of the wheel of control.\n\nSelf-driving cars are already here, in a sense. There are limited trials of vehicles running with no drivers along predetermined, hyper-limited routes in the U.S. and other countries, operated by their makers and technology companies. But the day when millions of self-driving cars ply the world\'s roads is still a long way out. But how far? We take a look at some of the most common questions surrounding self-driving cars and when you might no longer be behind the wheel.\n\nHow Much Does a Self-Driving Car Cost?\n\nAccording to former Waymo CEO John Krafcik, in an interview with German publication Manager Magazin, a Jaguar I-Pace equipped with Waymo\'s sensors and computers costs no more than a moderately equipped Mercedes-Benz S-Class. So likely in the $130,000-$150,000 ballpark. Of course, these costs will come down as the technologies used to power self-driving cars (cameras, radar systems, sensors, advanced automotive computers) drop as the costs to make them become more affordable at scale and they advance enough to be relied upon in all circumstances and conditions. Using Waymo\'s lidar as an example, its engineering team was able to build a version that costs 90 percent less than what used to be $75,000 a unit.\n\nSee all 3 photos See all 3 photos\n\nWhat Are These Automated Driving Levels I Keep Hearing About?\n\nThe Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) has classified six levels of automation. Level 0, Level 1, and Level 2 systems require a human to be actively driving and monitoring the vehicle and the driving environment at all times; think lane-keep assist or active cruise-control systems as seen on current vehicles. But Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 are where automated systems start to take control and when ""self-driving"" enters the picture. Level 3 is in essence a bridge level where the system can drive the car for a period of time, but the driver must still be ready to re-engage with the system at a moment\'s notice. Level 4 and 5 are where the car essentially drives you, with Level 4 still having a few limited scenarios where the driver may need to take over. Level 5 means never having any control of the vehicle whatsoever.\n\nCan I Buy a Self-Driving Car Now?\n\nNo. No vehicles available for sale in the U.S. today are self-driving. Cars equipped with Tesla Autopilot, Ford BlueCruise, and GM SuperCruise are NOT self-driving. They may appear to be self-driving, given that you can drive without your hands on the steering wheel for a predetermined length of time, but they are not reliable or capable enough to be true self-driving. Those systems are classified as Level 2 capable, where the driver can briefly cede driving responsibilities but must be alert and always ready to take over. In effect, the driver is still in charge of the operation of the vehicle, no matter what the system is capable of performing.\n\nSee all 3 photos See all 3 photos\n\nWhen Can I Buy a Self-Driving Car in the Future?\n\nAt this point, self-driving cars are more of a future technology like what you might see in Black Mirror (a near future science fiction TV drama). The tech seems highly plausible, but we are not there yet in reality. We are at a point where we may see Level 3 self-driving cars in the next five years, but they would only work in very limited conditions. Chances are, you may be able to ride in a self-driving taxi without a driver before seeing a self-driving car for sale on a dealer lot. There are still many problems to tackle before Level 4 or 5 autonomous cars can become a real thing. In the meantime, companies will sell some intermediate products to fund their self-driving development. For example, Tesla\'s Full Self-Driving (FSD) system. In theory, a Tesla with FSD has the hardware to ""self-drive,"" but development is not there yet. What Tesla is selling now is a Level 2 driving assist system for real and self-driving as a promise.\n\nWhat Are the Advantages of Self-Driving Cars?\n\nSafety is a major benefit of self-driving cars. The prevailing wisdom is that self-driving systems will drastically reduce or even remove human error on the road, which will reduce crashes to virtually zero. Humans can get tired and distracted, something machines and algorithms will never be. Computers are also able to strictly follow rules and cooperate with one another, so along with a reduced number of crashes, self-driving cars can help smooth out traffic flow and reduce traffic jams. They can also solve the headache of looking for a parking spot by self-parking by themselves. For people who cannot drive (age, disability, or any other reason), automated vehicles can provide them with new personal mobility options.\n\nWhat are Disadvantages of Self-Driving Cars?\n\nIn today\'s stage, the self-drive working condition is very limited. Honda\'s Traffic Jam Pilot can only self-drive under 30 mph (Audi\'s under 37 mph), and Level 4 Waymo vehicles can only operate within a confined zone when weather permits. High cost will also remain a disadvantage until the technology becomes mainstream. Then there\'s the question of how infallible all of the computing power and technology necessary to power self-driving cars will be. Personal computers freeze all the time. What happens when a car\'s computer brain freezes?\n\nCan You Sleep in a Self-Driving Car?\n\nIn a true Level 4 or 5 automated vehicle, yes, you could sleep, but at that point, you\'re basically a passenger, much like riding in a taxi. But in a Level 3 car you\'ll need to remain awake because whenever self-driving conditions are not met, the system needs a human driver to take control. And NO, DO NOT sleep in a Tesla on Autopilot. It is not a self-driving car, even if you bought the Full Self-Driving option.\n\nWhat Technologies Are Essential for Self-Driving Cars?\n\nDriving is a complicated task, so there are many technologies involved. To name a few: ultra-high-resolution cameras with high-dynamic-range sensors to see in various light conditions, ultrasonic sensors to detect objects around the car, light-emitting radar (lidar) to detect faraway objects, ultra-fast computer chips to process the large influx of data pouring in by the millisecond (not to mention storage of said data), and sophisticated software to do the driving. You also need high-speed internet connections to move data to and from the car, to and from other cars, and to and from any infrastructure. One major tech development that will help speed up self-driving car development is machine learning. It contributes to a boost in developing greater image recognition and driving algorithms.\n\nWhat Is Machine Learning for Cars?'";"Autonomous Cars";"205.txt-Autonomous Cars"

"21.txt";"b'Why Driverless Cars?\n\nThe idea of an \xe2\x80\x9cautonomous\xe2\x80\x9d vehicle that can navigate without human intervention fascinates consumers, and they enjoy watching videos of motorists working on a laptop or reading the newspaper while riding passively in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat.\n\nOn the technology side, much attention has been given to how these vehicles navigate using sophisticated sensors paired with map information, satellite location signals and tremendous computing power. However, the real story is the potential benefits to consumers that could come from automated vehicles. These include:\n\nFewer Crashes: According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, more than 35,000 lives were lost on U.S. highways in 2015. In addition, the economic and societal costs of collisions are a staggering $836 billion per year. Studies estimate more than 94 percent of all collisions are the result of human error, and autonomous vehicles could potentially eliminate most crashes by managing the hazards of driving better than most people. A computerized car can react faster than a human, and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get distracted or tired, talk or text on a cell phone or suffer road rage.\n\nAccording to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, more than 35,000 lives were lost on U.S. highways in 2015.

Road Use Efficiency: Autonomous vehicles will support more widespread use of car sharing, reducing the total number of vehicles on the road. Self-driving vehicles can also operate with less space between cars than is needed to allow for human driver reaction times. As a result, more vehicles can be accommodated on each mile of roadway, and could help identify specific areas for additional infrastructure.\n\nHowever, all of these benefits depend on a number of factors: achieving a critical mass of reliable autonomous vehicles that minimizes human input on driving, and creating interoperable and cooperative systems where vehicles and infrastructure can communicate in order to create more efficient traffic management, and consumer acceptance. These could be decades away.\n\nAutomated Vehicles to Hit the Road by 2020? Not So Fast\n\nWhen automakers and tech companies talk about Level 5 or fully self \xe2\x80\x93 driving vehicles, they aren\xe2\x80\x99t trying to find cars in a parking garage. Instead, modern vehicles are categorized by the level of autonomous technology they offer. Levels start at 0, for cars with no autonomous controls, and rise to Level 5 for cars that can perform all driving tasks and monitor the driving environment under all conditions in which a human driver could do the same.\n\nAutomakers and their partners, technology companies and research institutions are all working to develop self-driving technology and some experts say Level 5 vehicles could be on the road by 2020. In truth, autonomous technology exists on the road today in the form of safety features like adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking or lane keeping technologies that monitor the road and intervene when necessary.\n\nSome companies are already testing Level 4 or 5 vehicles, but these advanced technologies face technical challenges and human issues involving how drivers will interface with self-driving cars. Meanwhile, federal and state governments are determining how to adapt existing safety, licensing and liability laws and regulations to accommodate self-driving vehicles. As consumers slowly replace old cars with new cars, the U.S. will likely see a mix of vehicles with differing levels of automation on our roads for decades.\n\nAAA Q&A on Self-Driving Cars\n\nGreg Brannon has a bird\xe2\x80\x99s eye view of advancements in autonomous vehicles. As AAA\xe2\x80\x99s director of automotive engineering and industrial relations, Brannon manages the tests AAA runs on advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) such as adaptive cruise control and automatic emergency braking, which are precursors to fully-autonomous cars and trucks.\n\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s what Brannon has to say about where autonomous vehicle technology is today, its safety and security, and issues that will need to be addressed before fully automated self-driving cars hit the highway.'";"Autonomous Cars";"21.txt-Autonomous Cars"
"214.txt";"b""When it comes to self-driving cars, the future was supposed to be now.\n\nIn 2020, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be a \xe2\x80\x9cpermanent backseat driver,\xe2\x80\x9d the Guardian predicted in 2015. \xe2\x80\x9c10 million self-driving cars will be on the road by 2020,\xe2\x80\x9d blared a Business Insider headline from 2016. Those declarations were accompanied by announcements from General Motors, Google\xe2\x80\x99s Waymo, Toyota, and Honda that they\xe2\x80\x99d be making self-driving cars by 2020. Elon Musk forecast that Tesla would do it by 2018 \xe2\x80\x94 and then, when that failed, by 2020.\n\nBut the year is here \xe2\x80\x94 and the self-driving cars aren\xe2\x80\x99t.\n\nDespite extraordinary efforts from many of the leading names in tech and in automaking, fully autonomous cars are still out of reach except in special trial programs. You can buy a car that will automatically brake for you when it anticipates a collision, or one that helps keep you in your lane, or even a Tesla Model S (which \xe2\x80\x94 disclosure \xe2\x80\x94 my partner and I own) whose Autopilot mostly handles highway driving.\n\nBut almost every one of the above predictions has been rolled back as the engineering teams at those companies struggle to make self-driving cars work properly.\n\nWhat happened? Here are nine questions you might have had about this long-promised technology, and why the future we were promised still hasn\xe2\x80\x99t arrived.\n\n1) How exactly do self-driving cars work?\n\nEngineers have been attempting prototypes of self-driving cars for decades. The idea behind it is really simple: Outfit a car with cameras that can track all the objects around it and have the car react if it\xe2\x80\x99s about to steer into one. Teach in-car computers the rules of the road and set them loose to navigate to their own destination.\n\nThis simple description elides a whole lot of complexity. Driving is one of the more complicated activities humans routinely do. Following a list of rules of the road isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough to drive as well as a human does, because we do things like make eye contact with others to confirm who has the right of way, react to weather conditions, and otherwise make judgment calls that are difficult to encode in hard-and-fast rules.\n\nAnd even the simple parts of driving \xe2\x80\x94 like tracking the objects around a car on the road \xe2\x80\x94 are actually much trickier than they sound. Take Google\xe2\x80\x99s sister company Waymo, the industry leader in self-driving cars. Waymo\xe2\x80\x99s cars, which are fairly typical of other self-driving cars, use high-resolution cameras and lidar (light detection and ranging), a way of estimating distances to objects by bouncing light and sound off things.\n\nThe car\xe2\x80\x99s computers combine all of this to build a picture of where other cars, cyclists, pedestrians, and obstacles are and where they\xe2\x80\x99re moving. For this part, lots of training data is needed \xe2\x80\x94 that is, the car has to draw on millions of miles of driving data that Waymo has collected to form expectations about how other objects might move. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to get enough training data on the road, so the cars also train based on simulation data \xe2\x80\x94 but engineers have to be sure that their AI systems will generalize correctly from the simulation data to the real world.\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s far from a complete description of the systems at work when a self-driving car is on the road. But it illustrates an important principle to keep in mind when wondering where our self-driving cars are: Even the \xe2\x80\x9ceasy\xe2\x80\x9d things turn out to hide surprising complexity.\n\n2) Why is it taking longer than expected to get self-driving cars on the road?\n\nSelf-driving cars rely on artificial intelligence to work. And the 2010s were a great decade for AI. We saw big advances in translation, speech generation, computer vision and object recognition, and game-playing. AI used to have a hard time identifying dogs in pictures; now that\xe2\x80\x99s a trivial task.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s this progress in AI that drove the optimistic predictions for self-driving cars in the mid-2010s. Researchers anticipated that we could build on the amazing gains they\xe2\x80\x99d seen (and are still seeing) in other arenas.\n\nBut when it came to self-driving cars, the limitations of those gains became very apparent. Even with extraordinary amounts of time, money, and effort invested, no team could figure out how to have AI solve a real-world problem: navigating our roads with the high degree of reliability needed.\n\nMuch of the problem is the need for lots of training data. The ideal way to train a self-driving car would be to show it billions of hours of footage of real driving, and use that to teach the computer good driving behavior. Modern machine learning systems do really well when they have abundant data, and very poorly when they have only a little bit of it. But collecting data for self-driving cars is expensive. And since some events are rare \xe2\x80\x94 witnessing a car accident ahead, say, or encountering debris on the road \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s possible for the car to be out of its depth because it has encountered a situation so infrequently in its training data.\n\nCarmakers have tried to get around this in lots of ways. They\xe2\x80\x99ve driven more miles. They\xe2\x80\x99ve trained the cars in simulations. They sometimes engineer specific situations so that they can get more training data about those situations for the cars.\n\nAnd they are getting closer. Waymo cars do roam the streets of Arizona with no one behind the wheel (a small pool of specially screened people can call them up like they would an Uber). If all goes well, they may expand to more cities later this year (more on this below). But it\xe2\x80\x99s a hard problem, and progress has been slow.\n\n3) What does a world with self-driving cars look like?\n\nCompanies continue to invest despite the setbacks because self-driving cars, when they happen, will change a lot for the world \xe2\x80\x94 and make their creators lots of money.\n\nMany consumers will want to upgrade. Imagine being able to read or doze off during your morning drive to work or on long car trips. It also seems likely that taxi and ride-hailing companies will offer self-driving cars, rather than paying drivers (in fact, companies like Uber are betting on it). Self-driving cars should also make a huge difference for Americans with disabilities, many of whom can\xe2\x80\x99t get a driver\xe2\x80\x99s license and have trouble getting to work, the store, and doctor\xe2\x80\x99s appointments.\n\nExperts disagree on whether self-driving cars will change anything fundamental about car ownership in America. Some argue that people won\xe2\x80\x99t need to own a car if they can order one on their phone and get a timely robot ride anywhere.\n\nOthers have pointed out that people generally still own a car even in areas with good ride-share coverage and that self-driving cars might not be any different. Polls suggest that most Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be driven to work by a self-driving car \xe2\x80\x94 but that might change fast once such cars actually exist. Gallup polling on this question found a small share (9 percent) of Americans who\xe2\x80\x99d get such a car right away, with a larger contingent (38 percent) saying they\xe2\x80\x99d wait a while, and half holding steadfast that they\xe2\x80\x99d never use one.\n\nOver time, our infrastructure will likely change to make it easier for self-driving cars to navigate, and in fact, some researchers have argued that we won\xe2\x80\x99t have widespread self-driving cars until we\xe2\x80\x99ve made major changes to our streets to make it easier to communicate information to those cars. That would be expensive and require nationwide coordination, so it seems likely that it would follow the widespread introduction of self-driving cars rather than precede it.\n\n4) What are the leading self-driving car programs, and what are they doing?\n\nAlmost every major car manufacturer has at least tested the waters with self-driving car research. But some are much more serious about it than others.\n\nThere are two core statistics useful for evaluating how advanced a self-driving car program is. One is how many miles it has driven. That\xe2\x80\x99s a proxy for how much training data the company has, and how much investment it has poured into getting its cars on the road.\n\nThe other is disengagements \xe2\x80\x94 moments when a human driver has to take over because the computer couldn\xe2\x80\x99t handle a situation \xe2\x80\x94 per mile driven. Most companies don\xe2\x80\x99t share these statistics, but the state of California requires that they be reported, and so California\xe2\x80\x99s statistics are the best peek into how various companies are doing.\n\nOn both fronts, Google\xe2\x80\x99s sister company Waymo is the clear leader. Waymo just announced 20 million miles driven overall, most of those not in California. In 2018, Waymo drove 1.2 million miles in California, with 0.09 disengagements every 1,000 miles. Coming in second is General Motors\xe2\x80\x99 Cruise, with about half a million miles and 0.19 disengagements per 1,000 miles. (Cruise argues that since it tests its cars on San Francisco\xe2\x80\x99s difficult streets, these numbers are even more impressive than they look.)\n\nThose two companies are well ahead of everyone else in both miles driven and disengagements in the state of California. While that\xe2\x80\x99s only a limited snapshot of their efforts, most experts consider them the leading programs in general.\n\n5) Didn\xe2\x80\x99t a self-driving car kill a woman? How did that happen? And what are the safety issues involved with self-driving cars?\n\nMarch 18, 2018, was the first time a self-driving car ran down a pedestrian. An Uber car with a safety driver behind the wheel hit and killed Elaine Herzberg, a 49-year-old woman walking her bicycle across the street in Tempe, Arizona.\n\nThe incident was a reminder that self-driving car technology still had a long way to go. Some people were quick to point out that humans frequently kill other humans while driving, and that even if self-driving cars are much safer than humans, there will be some fatal incidents with self-driving cars. That\xe2\x80\x99s true as far as it goes. But it misses a key point. Human driving produces one fatal accident in every 100 million miles driven. Waymo, the leader in miles driven, just reached 20 million miles driven. It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had a fatal accident yet, but given the number of miles its cars have driven, it\xe2\x80\x99s simply far too soon to prove that they\xe2\x80\x99re as safe as or safer than a human driver.\n\nUber hasn\xe2\x80\x99t driven nearly as many miles and has had a fatal incident. The company doesn\xe2\x80\x99t release specific figures, but its filings for its IPO last year said that it had driven \xe2\x80\x9cmillions\xe2\x80\x9d of miles. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to tell without specific numbers, but it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to wonder if Uber\xe2\x80\x99s driving record is much worse than a human\xe2\x80\x99s.\n\nFurthermore, a review of Herzberg\xe2\x80\x99s death suggests that a lot of preventable mistakes were made. The accident report by the National Transportation Safety Board, released in December 2019, found that the near-range cameras and the ultrasonic sensors \xe2\x80\x9cwere not in use at the time of the crash.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAdditionally, the system was having such a problem with false alarms \xe2\x80\x94 detecting dangerous situations when none existed \xe2\x80\x94 that it had been programmed with \xe2\x80\x9ca one-second period during which the ADS [automated driving system] suppresses planned braking while the (1) system verifies the nature of the detected hazard and calculates an alternative path, or (2) vehicle operator takes control of the vehicle,\xe2\x80\x9d according to the NTSB report. So even when the car detected the hazard, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t brake \xe2\x80\x94 which could have made the collision avoidable or much less deadly \xe2\x80\x94 but instead continued with exactly what it was doing for a full second.\n\nThe system was designed to assume that pedestrians would never cross except at a crosswalk, so when one did cross without using one, it failed to identify her. Even worse, when the system was unclear on whether an object was a bicycle (as it was with Herzberg), it was unable to retain any information about how the object was moving. The system sensed her presence six full seconds before the impact \xe2\x80\x94 and yet did nothing (except possibly braking in the last two-tenths of a second) before colliding with her at deadly speed.\n\nThose are avoidable failures.\n\nUber pulled its cars off the road in response, returning to self-driving car trials a year later with a drastically changed program. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve implemented key safety improvements from both safety reviews, shared our learnings with the larger self-driving industry, and accepted the NTSB\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation to implement a Safety Management System, which is underway today,\xe2\x80\x9d Nat Beuse, Uber\xe2\x80\x99s self-driving cars head of safety, told Vox in a statement in response to a request for comment. \xe2\x80\x9cAs we look ahead to the future, we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to keep safety at the center of every decision we make.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNonetheless, deadly accidents with self-driving cars will keep happening \xe2\x80\x94 and it\xe2\x80\x99s not just Uber. A report from the National Transportation Safety Board implicated Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s Autopilot system in another lethal 2018 accident; while the driver had his hands off the wheel, the car steered into a concrete divider and crashed, killing him. A full investigation hasn\xe2\x80\x99t yet been conducted on three more recent deadly Tesla crashes. The problem, according to NTSB chairman Robert Sumwalt, is that drivers assume Autopilot lets them take their attention off the road, when they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. That won\xe2\x80\x99t be a problem with fully autonomous vehicles, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a potentially major one now.\n\nAs I\xe2\x80\x99ve written before, getting good self-driving cars on the road can save hundreds of thousands of lives. But it takes a lot of engineering work to get the cars good enough to be lifesaving.\n\n6) Are self-driving cars going to be good for the environment?\n\nSome advocates have argued that self-driving cars will be good for the environment. They claim they might reduce car trips by making car ownership unnecessary and transitioning society to a model where most people don\xe2\x80\x99t own a car and just call for one when they need one.\n\nIn addition, others have argued that human drivers drive in a wasteful way \xe2\x80\x94 braking hard, accelerating hard, idling the engine, all of which use up fuel \xe2\x80\x94 which a computer could avoid.\n\nBut as self-driving cars have inched closer to reality, most of these claimed benefits have started to look less likely.\n\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s not much evidence that computers are dramatically more fuel-efficient drivers than humans. There\xe2\x80\x99s one small study suggesting adaptive cruise control improves efficiency a little (5 to 7 percent), but there\xe2\x80\x99s little else beyond that. Furthermore, researchers have examined the effects of more fuel-efficient cars on miles traveled and found that, under many circumstances, people drive more when cars get more fuel-efficient \xe2\x80\x94 so self-driving cars having higher fuel efficiency might not mean that they produce lower emissions.\n\nOne study attempting to estimate the effects of self-driving cars on car use behavior simulated a family having a self-driving car by paying for them to have a chauffeur for a week, and telling them to treat the chauffeur service the way they\xe2\x80\x99d treat having a car that could drive itself.\n\nThe result? They went on a lot more car trips.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s still possible that some big transition to a lower-driving world will happen. A study of one week of driving habits isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough to settle the question for sure. The researchers who conducted that study are preparing future studies, and it\xe2\x80\x99s possible those comparisons will turn up more encouraging results.\n\n7) So if they\xe2\x80\x99re not necessarily safer and they\xe2\x80\x99re not necessarily greener, why are we even doing this?\n\nThe above few sections might inspire some pessimism, but there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of reason to be excited about self-driving cars. They will likely make life easier for older people and those with disabilities who cannot safely drive. They might provide better, safer, and cheaper options for people currently forced to own a car to get anywhere. Additional research and development will make them safer \xe2\x80\x94 and once the kinks are worked out, there is a likelihood that self-driving cars will be safer than human-driven ones.\n\nIn a sense, we\xe2\x80\x99re in an awkward transition moment where we want self-driving cars they aren\xe2\x80\x99t yet an uncomplicated positive.\n\nResearch and development is proceeding anyway, mostly because self-driving cars will probably be a gold mine for the first company to get them on the road. They\xe2\x80\x99ll likely be able to establish themselves in ride-hailing, taxi, and trucking markets while competitors are still struggling to catch up, and then they\xe2\x80\x99ll benefit from the additional miles traveled to further improve their cars.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not uncommon for a technology to be dangerous and barely worth it when it is first invented, only to eventually be refined into a valuable part of modern life. The first airplanes were dangerous and commercially useless, but we improved things dramatically from there.\n\n8) What role does policy play in the development of self-driving cars?\n\nThere is no federal law regarding self-driving cars. Much of the action on policy has largely taken place at the state level. And the laws surrounding self-driving cars vary enormously by state, with 29 states having passed legislation.\n\nSelf-driving car development mostly happens in the states that have been friendliest to it \xe2\x80\x94 especially California and Arizona \xe2\x80\x94 and it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to envision some states banning self-driving cars long after they become commonplace in other states, especially if the safety case for them isn\xe2\x80\x99t a slam-dunk.\n\nWhen self-driving cars were first proposed, I heard a lot of worries that regulators would unnecessarily delay their implementation. By 2016, it was obvious that hadn\xe2\x80\x99t come to pass. Indeed, in some cases regulators may have been too permissive \xe2\x80\x94 for example, in light of Uber pulling its cars and instituting new safety procedures, it seems the vehicle that killed Elaine Herzberg probably shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been on the road at all.\n\nPolicy might also shape whether self-driving cars are good or bad for the environment. With high taxes on gasoline, for example, the social costs of carbon emissions could be reflected in the price of using self-driving cars \xe2\x80\x94 and the money can be spent on climate adaptation and clean energy. But right now, our transportation policy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do much of anything about the social costs of driving, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a problem that will only get worse if self-driving cars put more people on the road.\n\n9) So just when are we getting self-driving cars?\n\nIn some senses, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been \xe2\x80\x9cclose\xe2\x80\x9d on self-driving cars for years now. Waymo is doing test runs with no one behind the wheel in Arizona, which it\xe2\x80\x99s been doing since 2017. Cruise delayed the 2019 launch of its autonomous taxi service but thinks it might happen in 2020. Earlier this year, the company unveiled a car with no steering wheel ... and no timetable for when it\xe2\x80\x99ll be available for sale. Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s periodic software updates make its Autopilot highway self-driving work better, but it remains well short of full self-driving.\n\nThere are certainly skeptics. Recently, the CEO of Volkswagen said that fully self-driving cars might \xe2\x80\x9cnever happen.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThat might be an overly harsh forecast, considering the progress that\xe2\x80\x99s been made. But it is exasperatingly difficult to get a good estimate of how long until self-driving cars happen for real for the typical American, both because no one knows for sure and because companies have incentives to publicize optimistic estimates. The companies boast about their progress but don\xe2\x80\x99t publish their mishaps. Timelines slip, and the change in plans is often publicly acknowledged only long after it\xe2\x80\x99s become obvious that the deadline can\xe2\x80\x99t be met.\n\nAt the same time, companies hesitate to put their cars on the road when there\xe2\x80\x99s any chance they aren\xe2\x80\x99t ready. They are well aware that killing someone, as Uber did, is not only horrible but also probably spells doom for their business. So there\xe2\x80\x99s ample incentive to say optimistic things and not actually launch.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not hard to imagine their arrival later this year, at least in sufficiently limited contexts; it\xe2\x80\x99s also not hard to imagine that the deadlines will be pushed out another three or four years.\n\nSelf-driving cars are on their way. They\xe2\x80\x99re closer than they were a year ago.

And road flares.\n\nNew tests, in years of tests, revealed more and more distractions for the driverless cars. Their road skills improved, but matching the competence of human drivers was elusive. The cluttered roads of America, it turned out, were a daunting place for a robot.\n\nThe wizards of Silicon Valley said people would be commuting to work in self-driving cars by now. Instead, there have been court fights, injuries and deaths, and tens of billions of dollars spent on a frustratingly fickle technology that some researchers say is still years from becoming the industry\xe2\x80\x99s next big thing.\n\nNow the pursuit of autonomous cars is undergoing a reset. Companies like Uber and Lyft, worried about blowing through their cash in pursuit of autonomous technology, have tapped out.

"216.txt";"b'What are the challenges with autonomous cars?\n\nFully autonomous (Level 5) cars are undergoing testing in several pockets of the world, but none are yet available to the general public. We\xe2\x80\x99re still years away from that. The challenges range from the technological and legislative to the environmental and philosophical. Here are just some of the unknowns.\n\nLidar and Radar\n\nLidar is expensive and is still trying to strike the right balance between range and resolution. If multiple autonomous cars were to drive on the same road, would their lidar signals interfere with one another? And if multiple radio frequencies are available, will the frequency range be enough to support mass production of autonomous cars?\n\nWeather Conditions\n\nWhat happens when an autonomous car drives in heavy precipitation? If there\xe2\x80\x99s a layer of snow on the road, lane dividers disappear. How will the cameras and sensors track lane markings if the markings are obscured by water, oil, ice, or debris?\n\nTraffic Conditions and Laws\n\nWill autonomous cars have trouble in tunnels or on bridges? How will they do in bumper-to-bumper traffic? Will autonomous cars be relegated to a specific lane? Will they be granted carpool lane access? And what about the fleet of legacy cars still sharing the roadways for the next 20 or 30 years?\n\nState vs. Federal Regulation\n\nThe regulatory process in the U.S. has recently shifted from federal guidance to state-by-state mandates for autonomous cars. Some states have even proposed a per-mile tax on autonomous vehicles to prevent the rise of \xe2\x80\x9czombie cars\xe2\x80\x9d driving around without passengers. Lawmakers have also written bills proposing that all autonomous cars must be zero-emission vehicles and have a panic button installed. But are the laws going to be different from state to state? Will you be able to cross state lines with an autonomous car?\n\nAccident Liability\n\nWho is liable for accidents caused by an autonomous car? The manufacturer? The human passenger? The latest blueprints suggest that a fully autonomous Level 5 car will not have a dashboard or a steering wheel, so a human passenger would not even have the option to take control of the vehicle in an emergency.\n\nArtificial vs. Emotional Intelligence\n\nHuman drivers rely on subtle cues and non-verbal communication\xe2\x80\x94like making eye contact with pedestrians or reading the facial expressions and body language of other drivers\xe2\x80\x94to make split-second judgment calls and predict behaviors. Will autonomous cars be able to replicate this connection? Will they have the same life-saving instincts as human drivers?'";"Autonomous Cars";"216.txt-Autonomous Cars"

Self-driving vehicles\xe2\x80\x94the stuff of science fiction since the first roads were paved\xe2\x80\x94are coming, and they\xe2\x80\x99re going to radically change what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to get from point A to point B.\n\nIn 2009, Google started the self-driving car project with the goal of driving autonomously over ten uninterrupted 100-mile routes. In 2016, Waymo, an autonomous driving technology company, became a subsidiary of Alphabet, and Google's self-driving project became Waymo.\n\nSince then, Waymo has invited the public to join the first public trial of autonomous vehicles operated by the Waymo Driver and introduced its first fully autonomous vehicles operated by the Waymo Driver on public roads without anyone in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat.\n\nKey Takeaways The hype around driverless cars has grown rapidly over the past several years, with many big technology companies getting behind the concept.\n\nGoogle launched its Waymo division to develop and market consumer-ready driverless vehicles around the globe.\n\nThe company, along with several others in the tech and auto industries, is betting that driverless cars will soon change the way we get around in a major way.\n\nAmong the revolutionary changes will be safer roads, fewer fossil fuels, and lower transportation costs.\n\nBasic Technology Already In Use\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe building blocks of driverless cars are on the road now,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Russ Rader, senior vice president of communications at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf. He pointed to the front-crash prevention systems that for several years have been able to warn drivers of an impending obstacle and apply the brakes if they don\xe2\x80\x99t react fast enough.\n\nThese systems were quickly followed by technology that allows cars to self-park by sizing up a free spot and automatically steering into it, with the driver only controlling the accelerator and brake pedals. Mercedes-Benz took autonomous driving even further when they introduced Drive Pilot, which allows the driver to hand over direct control of steering and speed in certain circumstances, while still supervising the overall operation of the car.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nIn 2018, Waymo announced that they would be making self-driving cars available by 2020. However, despite some extraordinary advancements, in the year 2020, self-driving cars are still out of reach, except in some trial programs.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf The current technology on the market is limited to cars that will automatically brake for you if they anticipate a collision, cars that help keep you in your lane, and cars that can mostly handle highway driving.\n\nThe idea behind self-driving cars is fairly simple: build a car with cameras that can track all the objects around it. The car should react if it\xe2\x80\x99s about to steer into one. And once in-car computers know all driving rules, they should be able to navigate to their destination. In the end, you might say that the execution of these ideas has been more complicated than was anticipated.\n\nWaymo's cars, the leader in self-driving technology, use high-resolution cameras and lidar (light detection and ranging, which is a way of estimating the distance to another object by bouncing light and sound off things). This technology helps the self-driving car identify where other cars, cyclists, pedestrians, and obstacles are and where they\xe2\x80\x99re moving.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nA Drastic Change\n\nWith the adoption of any new revolutionary technology, it is predicted there will be problems for businesses that don\xe2\x80\x99t adjust fast enough to future developments in self-driving car technology. Futurists estimate that hundreds of billions of dollars (if not trillions) will be lost by automakers, suppliers, dealers, insurers, parking companies, and many other car-related enterprises. And think of the lost revenue for governments via licensing fees, taxes and tolls, and by personal injury lawyers and health insurers.\n\nWho needs a car made with heavier-gauge steel and eight airbags (not to mention a body shop) if accidents are so rare? Who needs a parking spot close to work if your car can drive you there, park itself miles away, only to pick you up later? Who needs to buy a flight from Boston to Cleveland when you can leave in the evening, sleep much of the way, and arrive in the morning?\n\nIndeed, one of Google\xe2\x80\x99s goals is to facilitate car-sharing.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf That means fewer cars on the road. Fewer cars, period. Who needs to own a car when you can just order a shared one and it\xe2\x80\x99ll drive up minutes later, ready to take you wherever you want?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis [has the potential to] dramatically reduce the number of cars on the street, 80% of which have people driving alone in them, and also a household's cost of transportation, which is 18% of their income\xe2\x80\x94around $9,000 a year\xe2\x80\x94for an asset that they use only 5% of the time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Robin Chase, the founder and CEO of Buzzcar, a peer-to-peer car-sharing service, and co-founder and former CEO of Zipcar.\n\nIn 2030, self-driving cars are expected to create $87 billion worth of opportunities for automakers and technology developers, said a report by Boston-based Lux Research.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf Software developers stand to win big.\n\nA Manufacturing Revolution\n\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re an automaker, such as Ford Motor Co. (F), General Motors Co. (GM), Chrysler Group LLC, Toyota Motor Corp. or Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (HMC), which account for almost 70% of the U.S. market, you could see an initial surge in the $600 billion in annual new and used car sales globally.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf \xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf But as soon as the technology takes hold, sales could fall off significantly as sharing popularizes.\n\nCars will always need steel, glass, an interior, a drivetrain, and some form of human interface (even if that interface is little more than a wireless connection to your smartphone). But much of everything else could change. As an example, take front-facing seats; they could become an option, not a requirement. Automakers that see the changes coming\xe2\x80\x94such as how the big profits are secured downstream by car servicers, insurers, and more\xe2\x80\x94are focusing on services as much as on what and how they manufacture.\n\nInfrastructure Transformation\n\nWith fewer cars around, parking lots and spaces that cover roughly one-third of the land area of many U.S. cities can be repurposed. That could mean temporary downward pressure on real estate values as supply increases. It could also mean greener urban areas and revitalized suburbs if longer commutes become more palatable. And if fewer cars are on the road, federal, state, and local government agencies may be able to reallocate a good portion of the roughly $180 billion spent annually on highways and roads.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nChanging Oil Demand\n\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re in the business of finding, extracting, refining, and marketing hydrocarbons, such as Exxon Mobil (EOX), Chevron (CVX), or BP (BP), you could see your business fluctuate as use changes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese vehicles should practice very efficient eco-driving practices, which is typically about 20% better than the average driver,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chase. \xe2\x80\x9cOn the other hand, if these cars are owned by individuals, I see a huge rise in the number of trips, and vehicle miles traveled. People will send out their car to run errands they would never do if they had to be in the car and waste their own time. If the autonomous cars are shared vehicles and people pay for each trip, I think this will reduce demand, and thus (vehicle miles traveled).\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSafety Dividend\n\nAutonomous vehicles are also expected to be safer. \xe2\x80\x9cThese cars won't get drunk or high, drive too fast, or take unnecessary risks\xe2\x80\x94things people do all the time,\xe2\x80\x9d Chase said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOver 90% of accidents today are caused by driver error,\xe2\x80\x9d said Professor Robert W. Peterson of the Center for Insurance Law and Regulation at Santa Clara University School of Law. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is every reason to believe that self-driving cars will reduce the frequency and severity of accidents, so insurance costs should fall, perhaps dramatically.\xe2\x80\x9d\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCars can still get flooded, damaged, or stolen,\xe2\x80\x9d notes Michael Barry, vice president of media relations at the Insurance Information Institute. \xe2\x80\x9cBut this technology will have a dramatic impact on underwriting. A lot of traditional underwriting criteria will be upended.\xe2\x80\x9d\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nBarry said it\xe2\x80\x99s too early to quantify exactly how self-driving vehicles will affect rates, but added that injured parties in a crash involving a self-driving car may choose to sue the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s manufacturer or the software company that designed the autonomous capability.\n\nInitially, insurers such as State Farm Insurance, Allstate Corp. (ALL), Liberty Mutual Group, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\xe2\x80\x99s (BRK-A) GEICO, Citigroup Inc.\xe2\x80\x99s (C) Travelers Group could see a huge benefit from lower accident liabilities. But they may wind up losing a big portion of the $200 billion in personal auto premiums they write every year as fewer cars take to the road.\n\nSome experts have even speculated that mandatory insurance for cars could be dropped. And as long as we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about financial services, what about the multitude of banks and creditors that lend buyers money in about 85% of car purchases if sales volume falls?\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nAccording to a University of Texas report, if only 10% of the cars on U.S. roads were autonomous, almost $30 billion of savings could be realized via less wasted time and fuel, as well as fewer injuries and deaths. At 90%, the benefit rises to almost $120 billion a year.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nCloser to Home\n\nSelf-driving cars could have a substantial impact on the taxi and limousine industries and could potentially create new ones. Chase noted that they could be used to share specific trips, as a kind of pay-as-you-go small-scale public transportation\xe2\x80\x94for example, taking a disparate bunch of Manhattanites to the same beach in the Hamptons in one trip.\n\nOne study found that a fleet of 9,000 driverless taxis could serve all of Manhattan at about $0.50 per mile (compared to about $5 per mile now). At the time the study was published, there were licenses for over 13,000 taxis in New York City.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nSelf-driving cars may also challenge train lines. \xe2\x80\x9cA self-driving car offers much of the convenience of rail service with the added convenience that the service is portal-to-portal rather than station-to-station,\xe2\x80\x9d Peterson said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the other hand, a fleet of self-driving cars available at the station may make rail service more palatable. \xe2\x80\x9cThe technology has already been adopted in closed systems, such as campuses, air-terminals, and mining,\xe2\x80\x9d he noted. \xe2\x80\x9cRio Tinto Group (RIO), a large mining company, uses enormous self-driving trucks in its mining operations. European countries are experimenting with the platooning of trucks. Among other things, this saves about 18% in fuel.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRisks and Hurdles\n\nThere are regulatory and legislative obstacles to the widespread use of self-driving cars and substantial concerns about privacy. (Who will have access to any driving information these vehicles store?) There\xe2\x80\x99s also the question of security, as hackers could theoretically take control of these vehicles, and are not known for their restraint or civic-mindedness.\n\nThe Future of Waymo\n\nIn March 2020, Waymo Via, the trucking division of Waymo, was launched. According to Google, since 2017 Waymo Driver had been learning to drive large Class 8 trucks in the same way that it had learned how to drive passenger vehicles. Waymo is currently testing its fleet of trucks in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, and has launched a pilot program for local delivery in the Phoenix, Arizona area.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nWaymo has partnerships with multiple vehicle manufacturers to integrate its technology. In October 2020, Waymo and Daimler Trucks partnered to create an autonomous version of the Freightliner Cascadia truck. This is Waymo's first foray into the freight industry. Daimler's trucks will be equipped with autonomous technology that allows them to drive without a human but only in pre-defined areas.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nGoogle\xe2\x80\x99s Self-Driving Car FAQs\n\nIs Google Making a Car?\n\nGoogle has made it clear that it has no plans to build cars itself. Waymo is a self-driving technology company; it does not intend to manufacture and sell its own line of vehicles.\n\nWhat Year Will There Be Self-Driving Cars?\n\nEarly estimates about self-driving cars being the norm by 2020 have turned into having a few research vehicles on the road by 2020. Even if the technology is not developing as fast as expected, computer-processing capabilities and sophisticated artificial intelligence systems are becoming more advanced and more affordable every year. It's not clear when all the pieces will truly fall into place to allow for driverless technologies to safely navigate public roads among traditional cars. While experts agree that there will be a time in the future when this is true, they disagree on the timeline.\n\nHow Much Does the Google Car Cost?\n\nGoogle does not manufacture or sell its own cars. However, you can purchase a semi-autonomous Honda Civic that comes with advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) that control the steering, lane changing, acceleration, and braking while the car is cruising on the highway. You can also purchase a Tesla Motors vehicle that comes equipped with its semi-autonomous Autopilot feature.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nHowever it plays out, these vehicles are coming\xe2\x80\x94and fast. Their full adoption will take decades, but their convenience, cost, safety, and other factors will make them ubiquitous and indispensable. Such as with any technological revolution, the companies that plan ahead, adjust the fastest, and imagine the biggest will survive and thrive. And companies invested in old technology and practices will need to evolve or risk dying.""";"Autonomous Cars";"217.txt-Autonomous Cars"
"218.txt";"b'Artificial intelligence (AI) is used in a wide variety of products and services, including maps embedded on our smart phones and \xe2\x80\x9cchat bots\xe2\x80\x9d that help answer our questions on websites. Many hope that AI will transform our economy in ways that drive growth, similar to how steam engines did in the late 19th century and electricity did in the early 20th century. But it is hard to imagine that maps on smart phones, chatbots, and other existing AI-enabled services will drive the type of economic growth we saw from stream and electricity. What we need to see are some dramatic new AI-enabled products and services that transform our way of life\xe2\x80\x94in short, we are waiting for an AI \xe2\x80\x9ckiller app.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRobert Seamans Associate Professor and Director of the Center for the Future of Management - Stern School of Business, NYU\n\nAutonomous vehicles (AVs)\xe2\x80\x94vehicles that accelerate, brake, and turn on their own, requiring little or no input from a human driver\xe2\x80\x94may be such a killer app that transforms our economy significantly. AI supports AVs in a variety of ways, including quickly processing and interpreting the large amounts of data generated by the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s cameras and sensors and helping to improve vehicle fuel efficiency and safety. The impacts of broad adoption of AVs are equally numerous, from potentially lowering transportation costs by limiting the need for drivers to possibly transforming mobility in urban and suburban environments. While the relative timing and scale of economic growth is not yet clear\xe2\x80\x94and subject to some debate among scholars\xe2\x80\x94a key step in maximizing the benefits of AVs is passing federal legislation, rather than relying on a patchwork of state and local guidelines. To inform the debate and help prepare policymakers for the task at hand, this report will examine the state of AVs, the potential for them to become a \xe2\x80\x9ckiller app\xe2\x80\x9d with broad impacts, and the existing and potential regulations that could ensure net positive effects on the economy and society as a whole.\n\nThe current state and future of AVs\n\nThe current standards for autonomous driving were developed by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE International). According to the SAE standard, the automation capability of vehicles ranges from Level 0, with no autonomy, to Level 5, which is full automation. Level 1 features include park assist, lane assist and adaptive cruise control. Some Level 3 vehicles, which include full self-driving capabilities but require human intervention in complex situations such as traffic jams, may be commercially available in 2021. No Level 4 or 5 cars, which would not require any human intervention, are yet certified for use on regular roads, though there are some such as Google\xe2\x80\x99s Waymo that are in development.\n\nWhile the potential impacts of AVs are substantial, it will take time for them to be realized; AVs are still some years from being commercially available, let alone in widespread use. To give a reasonable sense of timing, Chris Urmson\xe2\x80\x94a DARPA challenge winner, head of Google\xe2\x80\x99s Waymo autonomous vehicle unit for many years, and now CEO of a self-driving vehicle software company named Aurora \xe2\x80\x94argues it may take up to 30 to 50 years before widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles. Despite predictions to the contrary\xe2\x80\x94e.g., Elon Musk\xe2\x80\x99s 2019 prediction that there would be a Tesla driverless taxi fleet in some regions by 2020\xe2\x80\x94time frames of this magnitude are common in the automobile industry. Choe, Oettl and Seamans (2021) report that widespread adoption of new innovations in the automobile sector historically can take several decades.1 There are a number of factors that contribute to technology adoption, and even if a new technology is feasible, it may not be available at a price point that many consumers will pay. For example, turbo-charged engines, which help to reduce the amount of fuel needed, did not start to become popular until oil prices started to rise in the 1970s.\n\nIn short, the timing of adoption of AVs and the economic impacts that will follow depend on many factors. For regulators and policymakers interested in shaping what will likely be considerable economic and societal impacts of AVs, now is the time.\n\nEffect on our economy and society\n\nSupporters of autonomous vehicles argue that they may provide a variety of benefits including fuel efficiency and safety. Indeed, the Brookings Institution recently published a book on the topic (Winston and Karpilow, 2020).2 The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) argues that AVs are more fuel efficient than human-driven cars, which means fewer emissions. However, AVs may increase vehicle traffic, potentially nullifying emissions reduction from fuel efficiency. Kroger, Kuhnimhof, and Trommer (2019) project the adoption of autonomous vehicle technologies may increase vehicle traffic by 2-9 percent as a result of new automobile user groups as well as lower generalized costs of car travel.3\n\nAVs will likely be safer than human-driven cars, in large part through reducing human error which the National Highway Traffic Safety Association (NHTSA) estimates accounts for 94 percent of crashes. While widespread adoption of AVs should ultimately result in safer roads, there have been several high profile accidents involving AVs, such as a Waymo van that crashed into a car in Arizona. Perhaps as a result of some of these high-profile accidents, consumer demand for AVs seems to be relatively low. According to a 2021 survey by the American Automobile Association, only 14 percent of drivers report that they would trust riding in a vehicle that drives itself, a response similar to the 2020 survey. It is possible, however, that consumer attitudes will change once Level 4 and 5 vehicles become commercially available.\n\nAVs may help to reduce labor input costs in driving-intensive industries. However, as Gittleman and Monaco (2017) point out, there are several types of drivers, and autonomous driving will likely affect some types more than others.4 Autonomous vehicles are more likely to be used for heavy and tractor trailer truck purposes (aka \xe2\x80\x9clong haul\xe2\x80\x9d) than local delivery given the relative ease of navigating on highways and all the other tasks associated with local delivery, including freight handling, paperwork, and customer service. Gittleman and Monaco estimate that Level 4 and 5 automation may ultimately displace 300,000 to 400,000 drivers. But the authors highlight that there are many practical limitations to automation. For example, they highlight that one of the important functions of a truck driver is to serve as a security guard for the freight.\n\nA recent paper by Gelauff, Ossokina, and Teulings (2019) envisions some of the longer-term outcomes from AVs.5 The authors model two countervailing effects from AVs, each of which lead to differing outcomes on population distribution. On one hand, AVs may lead to improved use of time during car trips, which lowers the cost of living at a distance from cities. On the other hand, AVs may lead to improved public transit options in urban environments in the form of shared-ride autonomous vehicles (SAVs). The authors argue that SAVs may be more efficient than existing public transit and may make city living relatively more attractive leading to more population clustering in cities. The authors argue that the second effect may outweigh the first and ultimately may lead to overall population shifts towards large, attractive cities at the expense of smaller urban and non-urban areas. While the authors don\xe2\x80\x99t speculate on the ultimate economic effects of such a change, it is worth noting that literature from economic geography suggests that there are many agglomeration effects from living in or close to cities, including greater economic growth and innovation.6 It is also worth noting that the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a large shift in population away from many urban environments, at least in the short run.\n\nIn short, AVs will likely affect our economy and society in a variety of ways. AVs may lead to fewer emissions and increased safety. By decreasing the need for humans to drive, AVs will likely transform the type of work done by humans in the transportation sector of the economy and may also change the way that humans commute to and from work. How all this plays out, however, depends on numerous factors including, importantly, existing and future regulations.\n\nCurrent and prospective AV legislation\n\nThe National Conference of State Legislatures highlights that a number of states have introduced and enacted laws related to autonomous vehicles. Notably, in December 2020, California State Senator Ben Allen introduced a bill to establish a new Council on the Future of Transportation in California that would promote state legislation for autonomous vehicles, in addition to other transportation-related policy. Also, in November 2020 the California Public Utilities Commission approved autonomous vehicle regulatory framework that would make it easier for companies to provide autonomous vehicle transportation services to the public. While these laws indicate that state legislators are responsive to local concerns about autonomous vehicles, the risk is a resulting patchwork of state laws.\n\nWith this concern in mind, there have been attempts at federal legislation, notably in 2017 with the SELF DRIVE Act in the House and the AV START Act in the Senate. The SELF DRIVE Act (Safely Ensuring Lives Future Deployment and Research In Vehicle Evolution Act) was passed in the House in 2017 but did not advance in the Senate. The bill would have provided NHTSA with the authority to regulate AVs. NHTSA would be authorized to require safety assessment certifications and states would be preempted from enacting laws regarding the design, construction, or performance of AVs unless those laws enact standards identical to federal standards. In addition, the bill would have required that manufacturers of AVs develop written cybersecurity and privacy plans for such vehicles prior to offering them for sale. The AV START Act (American Vision for Safer Transportation through Advancement of Revolutionary Technologies Act) was introduced in the Senate in 2017 but did not advance. Like the SELF DRIVE Act, it would have established a framework for a federal role in oversight of AVs, preempting state laws and providing clarity to stakeholders including car manufacturers and insurance companies.\n\nIt remains to be seen when federal legislation on AVs will be passed, although there are promising signs. Reportedly, there is currently bipartisan support for federal legislation, notably from Republican Senator John Thune and Democratic Senator Gary Peters (who were co-sponsors of the AV START Act). While the Biden administration did not mention autonomous vehicles in its recently proposed infrastructure and jobs plan (instead focusing on electric vehicles and charging stations), Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has stated, \xe2\x80\x9cAutomated vehicle technology is coming, it\xe2\x80\x99s advancing very quickly, it is something that holds the potential to be transformative, and I think in many ways policy has not kept up.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nExisting regulatory barriers: Spectrum\n\nOne important issue to be resolved is around communication standards between autonomous vehicles. The 5.9 GHz spectrum, a 75 MHz band, had initially been set aside for use for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications in 1999, and NHTSA, car manufacturers, and device manufacturers spent the ensuing two decades working on a standard for V2V communications. However, the standard that emerged, called Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC), continues to face considerable resistance, including from a competing standard called Cellular-Vehicle-to-Vehicle (C-V2V). DSRC allows direct communication between two DSRC-enabled devices without relying on an intermediary, such as a cellular network, which in principle makes it fast and deployable in areas without cellular coverage. However, research by Gyawali et al (2020) suggests that DSRC only works well when two vehicles are in sight of each other and not moving too fast.7 C-V2V operates through a cellular network, which may limit its ability to function well in remote areas but handles communications between vehicles that are moving quickly (Gyawali et al 2020).\n\nSeparately, Wi-Fi demands have been growing, and the 5.9 GHz spectrum is increasingly being used for unlicensed Wi-Fi. A 2018 study by Rand Corporation estimated that the value of the consumer and producer surplus from using the entire band for Wi-Fi to be between $82.2 billion and $189.9 billion. In November 2019 Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Ajit Pai announced a plan whereby 45 MHz at the lower end of the band will be made available for Wi-Fi, the next 20 MHz for C-V2V, and the top 10 MHz potentially for C-V2V or DSRC. In November 2020 the FCC voted in favor of the proposal, despite objections by the Trump administration\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Transportation. There are calls for the Biden administration to reverse the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s decision. The plan would seem to bolster the C-V2V standard relative to DSRC, which may hasten resolution of the standards battle, and also favors use of Wi-Fi over transportation. It will be important for policymakers to consider the tradeoffs associated with use of the spectrum. On the one hand, demand for spectrum for Wi-Fi enabled devices is a growing and current need. In contrast, there is currently little need for spectrum for autonomous vehicles\xe2\x80\x94there aren\xe2\x80\x99t any commercially available and consumer demand seems low. On the other hand, spectrum for autonomous vehicles will likely be a future need, and the economic benefits of autonomous vehicles may outweigh the benefits of additional Wi-Fi.\n\nConclusion\n\nAutonomous vehicles will likely transform our economy, including changing the role of humans in transportation-related industries and potentially reducing emissions and increasing safety, all of which should ultimately lead to economic growth. However, large-scale adoption of autonomous vehicles and the ensuing economic growth will likely take time. The technology is still in development and consumers remain wary of autonomous vehicles. Moreover, federal and state legislation is still nascent, and there are competing standards for communication between vehicles. All of this needs to be resolved before AVs can become a \xe2\x80\x9ckiller app.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEditor\xe2\x80\x99s Note: This paper was updated from a previous version to reflect a change in Tesla vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s SAE automation level from 3 to 2.\n\nThe authors did not receive financial support from any firm or person for this article or from any firm or person with a financial or political interest in this article.

"219.txt";"b'Why Driverless Cars?\n\nThe idea of an \xe2\x80\x9cautonomous\xe2\x80\x9d vehicle that can navigate without human intervention fascinates consumers, and they enjoy watching videos of motorists working on a laptop or reading the newspaper while riding passively in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat.\n\nOn the technology side, much attention has been given to how these vehicles navigate using sophisticated sensors paired with map information, satellite location signals and tremendous computing power. However, the real story is the potential benefits to consumers that could come from automated vehicles. These include:\n\nFewer Crashes: According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, more than 35,000 lives were lost on U.S. highways in 2015. In addition, the economic and societal costs of collisions are a staggering $836 billion per year. Studies estimate more than 94 percent of all collisions are the result of human error, and autonomous vehicles could potentially eliminate most crashes by managing the hazards of driving better than most people. A computerized car can react faster than a human, and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get distracted or tired, talk or text on a cell phone or suffer road rage.\n\nAccording to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, more than 35,000 lives were lost on U.S. highways in 2015.

Improved Fuel Economy: Shorter commute times and reduced braking and acceleration thanks to better traffic management equals less fuel used.

Road Use Efficiency: Autonomous vehicles will support more widespread use of car sharing, reducing the total number of vehicles on the road. Self-driving vehicles can also operate with less space between cars than is needed to allow for human driver reaction times. As a result, more vehicles can be accommodated on each mile of roadway, and could help identify specific areas for additional infrastructure.\n\nHowever, all of these benefits depend on a number of factors: achieving a critical mass of reliable autonomous vehicles that minimizes human input on driving, and creating interoperable and cooperative systems where vehicles and infrastructure can communicate in order to create more efficient traffic management, and consumer acceptance. These could be decades away.\n\nAutomated Vehicles to Hit the Road by 2020? Not So Fast\n\nWhen automakers and tech companies talk about Level 5 or fully self \xe2\x80\x93 driving vehicles, they aren\xe2\x80\x99t trying to find cars in a parking garage. Instead, modern vehicles are categorized by the level of autonomous technology they offer. Levels start at 0, for cars with no autonomous controls, and rise to Level 5 for cars that can perform all driving tasks and monitor the driving environment under all conditions in which a human driver could do the same.\n\nAutomakers and their partners, technology companies and research institutions are all working to develop self-driving technology and some experts say Level 5 vehicles could be on the road by 2020. In truth, autonomous technology exists on the road today in the form of safety features like adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking or lane keeping technologies that monitor the road and intervene when necessary.\n\nSome companies are already testing Level 4 or 5 vehicles, but these advanced technologies face technical challenges and human issues involving how drivers will interface with self-driving cars. Meanwhile, federal and state governments are determining how to adapt existing safety, licensing and liability laws and regulations to accommodate self-driving vehicles. As consumers slowly replace old cars with new cars, the U.S. will likely see a mix of vehicles with differing levels of automation on our roads for decades.\n\nAAA Q&A on Self-Driving Cars\n\nGreg Brannon has a bird\xe2\x80\x99s eye view of advancements in autonomous vehicles. As AAA\xe2\x80\x99s director of automotive engineering and industrial relations, Brannon manages the tests AAA runs on advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) such as adaptive cruise control and automatic emergency braking, which are precursors to fully-autonomous cars and trucks.\n\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s what Brannon has to say about where autonomous vehicle technology is today, its safety and security, and issues that will need to be addressed before fully automated self-driving cars hit the highway.'";"Autonomous Cars";"219.txt-Autonomous Cars"

"230.txt";"b'Only a few years ago self-driving cars were no more than a vision in a science fiction movie. Today, the first partially automated vehicles with various assistance systems can already be seen on our roads. Autonomous driving is also no longer just a dream.\n\nAutonomous means that the car is fully independent in making decisions and responding to situations, including emergencies; no driver and no external intervention are needed. Enabling an even faster connection between transport systems, the 5G network will offer new application options advancing the development of autonomous cars. Not only will they be able to make autonomous decisions in the future, they will also communicate and cooperate with each other. Automated driving is the term used to describe a scenario where a fully interconnected and intelligent road transport system is created as a result of these capabilities.\n\n5G network as important foundation for autonomous driving\n\nIntelligent transport infrastructure through interconnectedness\n\nThe foundations for autonomous driving are fast and reliable communication networks, such as LTE and 5G. Therefore, Deutsche Telekom plans to install the 5G network on all key transport routes \xe2\x80\x93 such as freeways, main roads, and rail tracks \xe2\x80\x93 by 2025. Experts from various sectors are working at the 5G Automotive Association (5GAA), defining the basics for common standards in order to ensure that the new mobile communication standard meets the specific requirements for interconnecting the various transport users and for automated driving.\n\nThanks to wireless technology and internet connection, connected cars with their digital and location-related services can greatly improve our driving comfort. The car relies on regular data updates for navigation, e.g. detailed road maps, plus updates in unexpected traffic situations, such as congestion, rain, or black ice. In combination with apps for the driver and cloud systems, information for maintenance or other status reports can be retrieved and sent. Thanks to mobile edge computing, these functions are already realized today, based on LTE at a transmission rate of up to 300 megabit per second and latencies of less than 100 milliseconds, even in emergencies or remote-controlled driving at low speeds. 5G will offer even higher quality for many digital in-car services in the future.\n\n5G network expands automated systems\n\nSafety aspects are of course also a focus of attention for driving a car. In addition to the 4G capabilities, 5G offers special features for safety-relevant requirements that no other wireless network can provide.\n\nAutomated systems reach their limits when unexpected or unknown situations occur. In such a case an ""autopilot"" will decide to deactivate the system for safety reasons, if in doubt. An automated car would then return the task and responsibility of driving to the human driver. However, if the vehicle is not taken over by the driver, or not as quickly as required, then the car will be moved to the roadside in a secure driving mode.\n\nWith 5G, the car could, for instance, be controlled remotely by an external operator acting as traffic controller. The remote control through an operator is, however, definitely impossible without a 5G network, which offers key features such as very short response times and guaranteed network resources.\n\nBenefits of 5G for autonomous driving\n\nOne huge benefit of 5G is what is known as network slicing. The wireless network is subdivided into virtual network levels. One network level is then used only for automated driving, for instance. This ensures that safety-relevant notifications to self-driving cars will not end up in a traffic jam on the data highway and will be given priority over other infotainment services used in parallel.\n\nAnother benefit is the data processing and storage in data centers that are in close proximity to the transport routes. Such ""edge"" data centers ensure that data can be processed even faster in the network. In initial 5G tests on the A9 freeway between Nuremberg and Munich, latencies of less than 20 milliseconds were achieved. An autonomous car driving at a speed of 100 km/h would have traveled a mere 60 centimeters in that time. The virtual network levels and short transmission paths guarantee important quality features of the 5G mobile technology, such as low latencies and high bandwidths.\n\nSensors are used to implement car-to-car communication for automated driving. This includes, for example, intelligent camera systems, which enable the direct exchange of data between the cars. These systems have crucial physical disadvantages, however. They can neither look around corners, nor over hills, nor through obstacles. This is why they restrict the functioning of self-driving cars. This simple form of automation is also unsuitable at higher speeds.\n\nThis is where the 5G network offers another huge advantage. The mobile technology expands the scope of autonomous mobility through direct and, above all, fast and broadband data communication with cars and an appropriately equipped transport infrastructure, such as traffic lights. This can ensure improved traffic flows, for example by enabling cars to travel at higher speeds or reducing their speed in good time when necessary.\n\nAutomated driving has already begun with assisted driving\n\nThe automation of vehicles happens gradually, however. Fully automated driving, which can operate reliably in a large number of driving situations, is only the final stage of a long-lasting process. Half of all cars are already equipped with intelligent assistance systems. These are digital navigations systems, parking assistance, or speed regulation systems using cruise control as well as distance-regulation systems. Functions of an autonomous steering system for cars are already partially performed by driver assistance systems, such as steering and lane keeping assistants. Cars that can park themselves are also already available today. Despite these assistants it is the driver who remains responsible at all times. If, however, the vehicle is fully automated, the responsibility shifts from the driver to the means of transport and consequently to its manufacturer or operator. This is why many of the automation functions will at first be limited to sufficiently controllable driving situations, such as driving at lower and medium speeds on freeways or parking in a demarcated parking space.\n\nAutomatism creates personal freedoms\n\nHumans use automated functions in their day-to-day lives mainly in order to save time, which can then be used in a more meaningful or convenient way. So in the future \xe2\x80\x93 as mere passengers in self-driving cars \xe2\x80\x93 making use of mobile networks, we will surely be able to read the latest news on our smartphones or tablets, participate in video conferences or work, use entertainment services or shop online while on the move. Or we can simply sleep during the ride to arrive at our vacation destination well-rested or turn up for a business meeting refreshed and relaxed.'";"Autonomous Cars";"230.txt-Autonomous Cars"

Often called ""self-driving"" cars, AVs partially or entirely remove the need for a driver to control the vehicle.\n\n\n\nConnected and automated vehicles could increase travel options and make our roads safer. ODOT is monitoring technology developments, evaluating safety benefits and exploring ways connected and automated vehicles can increase mobility options for Oregonians.\n\n\n\nODOT is the lead agency coordinating autonomous vehicle programs and policies in Oregon, as designated by the Legislature in House Bill 4063 of 2018\n\nWhy do we need AV technology?\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says 94 percent of vehicle crashes are caused by human error. The majority of crashes are caused by 1) recognition errors, where drivers are not paying attention to the road or the vehicles around them; and, 2) decision errors, such as speeding, performing illegal maneuvers and misjudging gaps between vehicles or others\xe2\x80\x99 speed. Automated vehicles could eliminate the majority of these crashes.\n\nWhile automated vehicle systems require much more testing and validation before they are ready for commercial deployment, engineers are working to ensure they drive safely, closely follow traffic laws, and respond appropriately to changing road conditions. Automated vehicles do not get distracted and can monitor their environment in 360-degree, high-precision 3D.\n\nAutomated vehicles can also provide increased mobility to seniors, children, people with disabilities and others who are unable or choose not to drive. They could operate more efficiently than conventional vehicles, reducing congestion and emissions.\n\nSAE, the Society of Automotive Engineers, identified six levels of vehicle automation starting with Level 0, or no automation whatsoever, through Level 5, in which the vehicle has complete control. SAE, the Society of Automotive Engineers, identified six levels of vehicle automation starting with Level 0, or no automation whatsoever, through Level 5, in which the vehicle has complete control.\n\nYou might already be driving a vehicle that is above Level 0.

"238.txt";"b'By Erick Guerra\n\nAlthough technological, financial, and regulatory hurdles remain, fully autonomous vehicles will likely be driving themselves on city streets and highways in the next 20 years \xe2\x80\x94 well within a long-range planning horizon. Major car manufacturers already market and sell high-end vehicles with features like automated braking, self-parking, lane-departure warning, and variable-speed cruise control. Most are racing to develop fully autonomous vehicles \xe2\x80\x94 as are technology firms like Google and Uber \xe2\x80\x94 and nearly half a dozen states have passed laws allowing testing of driverless vehicles on public roads. (Current regulations require a human operator behind the wheel of an autonomous test vehicle, but these regulations are likely to change as the technology advances.)\n\nSelf-driving cars will have a number of social and economic effects. In addition to freeing drivers to engage in tasks other than driving, autonomous vehicles promise to reduce traffic collisions by removing humans, and thus human error and negligence, from behind the wheel. By allowing closer platooning and lowering the number of collisions, self-driving vehicles will also increase effective road capacity, particularly on highways.\n\nSince the initially steep upfront costs of driverless vehicles can be offset by lower labor costs, the freight, transit, and taxi industries could be early adopters of driverless technologies, affecting the country\'s 4.5 million bus, taxi, and truck drivers \xe2\x80\x94 mostly men with high school degrees or less, a demographic that has not fared well in the recent recession or the larger digital revolution.\n\nSelf-driving cars also could have profound, though highly uncertain, impacts on sustainability and urban form, two areas of particular interest to city and regional planners.\n\nTwo scenarios\n\nWhether self-driving cars reduce harmful emissions or the amount of land, energy, money, and other resources consumed by the transportation system depends largely on whether they reduce car ownership and driving. Optimists envision a future where driverless cars lead to a revolution in shared urban mobility. Why own a car when you can summon one to pick you up while avoiding the worries of parking, insurance, or maintenance?\n\nIn this scenario, the shift in ownership will also encourage payment based on miles driven and time of day rather than lumpy vehicle purchases, insurance fees, and parking. Instead of thinking about how much gas is in the tank, travelers will now consider the full marginal cost of a car trip when deciding whether to walk, bike, drive, or take transit. Transit service may also improve as a result of shared cars and minivans operating on fixed and flexible routes.\n\nThe biggest opportunity for improvement is in cities and neighborhoods where densities are currently too low to justify frequent bus or rail service. If shared or public, self-driving cars will dramatically reduce the demand for parking. Even privately owned vehicles will drop off passengers at front doors before driving off-site or behind a building to park, thus decoupling parking from other urban land uses. This would allow cities to dedicate more space to housing, shops, and offices, as well as stormwater management, street trees, and other sustainable features.\n\nPessimists, by contrast, see vehicle automation as one more technology that makes driving more comfortable and convenient and thus increases the amount that people drive. In this scenario, most households will own one or more self-driving cars, send their vehicles to run errands, circle to avoid paying for parking, and treat travel as if it had zero or very low time costs.\n\nMany cars may become full-time mobile offices, whisking people between meetings, and the number of workers commuting between metropolitan regions will almost certainly increase. Making long commutes more productive will support the growing trend in long-duration commutes. Between 1990 and 2010, the proportion of commuters traveling more than 60 minutes and more than 90 minutes to work increased from six to eight percent and 1.6 to 2.5 percent, respectively.\n\nSelf-driving cars will also expand personal mobility for the third of the population without drivers\' licenses and the tenth of households without cars due to age, disability, low income, or preference. A demonstration video of one of Google\'s prototype self-driving cars features a legally blind man riding to a Taco Bell in a self-driving vehicle.\n\nExpanded access to cars may be particularly important for the nation\'s elderly, many of whom live in and would like to remain in car-dependent communities. In this scenario, even if self-driving cars double existing capacity, this capacity will fill quickly \xe2\x80\x94 encouraging dispersed development and greater land consumption, which would further erode any sustainability benefits from increased efficiency.\n\nGlass half full or half empty?\n\nWhose view is more realistic \xe2\x80\x94 the optimists\' or the pessimists\'? Both may be partially correct. Net effects will vary across states, cities, and neighborhoods. In dense urban areas with good transit where the demand for space and shared mobility is higher, driverless cars will tend to increase density and improve transit. In sprawling areas, self-driving cars will encourage more sprawl by making it easier to live farther from employment centers and other destinations. Urban cores will likely concentrate while peripheral areas expand. Suburban areas will probably continue to rely on privately owned vehicles but could see improvements in transit and shared mobility.\n\nWhat can planners do to prepare for driverless vehicles? The new technology could produce rapid and radical changes to metropolitan transportation systems, particularly freight and transit. However, the timing, scale, and direction of the impacts are uncertain and the opportunities to influence outcomes are limited. For better or worse, major changes to passenger travel might be slow to materialize \xe2\x80\x94 the technology remains expensive and the vehicle fleet turns over slowly (the average passenger car is just over 11 years old). Some 15 years after the commercial release of the Toyota Prius, hybrid vehicles make up only a tiny share of the U.S. car fleet.\n\nRegardless, planners should pay close attention to the technology, start thinking about which regulations (particularly on-site parking requirements) could change quickly in response to new technologies, and perhaps redirect capital investments away from infrastructure-heavy projects with a long lifespan to shorter term, more flexible projects that are insulated from some of the uncertainty around the timing and impacts of self-driving cars.\n\nErick Guerra is an assistant professor of city and regional planning at the University of Pennsylvania, where his research focuses on the relationships between transportation infrastructure, land use, urban development, and travel behavior.\n\nWeb-Only Expanded Sidebar\n\nRead ""Attention: The Age of Automation Is Right Ahead,"" an expanded version of the article that appeared in the printed magazine.\n\nResources\n\nImage: This early prototype of Google\'s self-driving car was designed to go from point A to point B without human intervention.

This follows fatal crashes that may have involved its Autopilot feature. Tesla advertises a \xe2\x80\x9cFull Self-Driving\xe2\x80\x9d upgrade option. One man has been busted in Teslas more than once for reckless driving. He hangs out in the backseat and steers with his feet.\n\nMeanwhile, no cars are fully self-driving yet. I spoke with Missy Cummings, the director of the Humans and Autonomy Laboratory at Duke University. She says the so-called deep learning that cars need to see the road around them doesn\xe2\x80\x99t actually learn. The following is an edited transcript of our conversation.\n\nMissy Cummings (Photo courtesy Duke University)\n\nMissy Cummings: I can show a convolutional neural net a million images of a stop sign, and it will learn what a stop sign is from those images. But if it sees a stop sign that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t match exactly those images, then it can\xe2\x80\x99t recognize it. And this is a huge problem, because if a strand of kudzu leaves starts to grow across just the top 20% of a stop sign, that is enough to make that algorithm be dumb, and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t recognize it, because it\xe2\x80\x99s never seen a stop sign with one strand of kudzu leaves across it.\n\nMolly Wood: Is there an awareness of this, do you think? Is everybody sort of still trying to push the same solution when it comes to self-driving cars? Are people starting to realize these limitations and internalize them and change their approach at all?\n\nCummings: I think there are three camps of people not just in self-driving, but in robotics and artificial intelligence in general. There\xe2\x80\x99s the camp of people like me who know the reality. We recognize it for what it is, we\xe2\x80\x99ve recognized it for some time, and we know that unless we change fundamentally the way that we\xe2\x80\x99re approaching this problem, it is not solvable with our current approach. There\xe2\x80\x99s another larger group of people who recognize that there are some problems but feel like with enough money and enough time, we can solve it. And then there\xe2\x80\x99s a third group of people that no matter what you tell them, they believe that we can solve this problem. And you can\xe2\x80\x99t talk them off that platform.\n\nChange the approach to the problem\n\nThe people who are the biggest problem are the people in that second group, the ones that believe that with enough time and money, we can fix it, instead of recognizing the elephant in the room for what it is, which is not fixable under our current approach. And this is why you see companies like Starsky, a trucking company that went out of business, and you starting to see all the mergers across the automotive industry where all companies are either teaming up with each other or with software companies, because they realize that they just cannot keep hemorrhaging money the way they are. But that pit still has no bottom. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t see this becoming a viable commercial set of operations in terms of self-driving cars for anyone anywhere, ever, until we address this problem.\n\nWood: What about the tests that seem to be going fine, like Waymo testing fully operating taxis in Phoenix with no support drivers and not having crashes?\n\nCummings: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s interesting to me that that\xe2\x80\x99s your perception, because that\xe2\x80\x99s the perception that Waymo wants you to have. But the reality is behind every self-driving car in Phoenix, there are a team of humans that are remotely monitoring and potentially intervening when the systems go down. And there was recently a video that went viral on YouTube, where a Waymo car in its fully self-driving mode got stuck by a single orange cone. And eventually, they had to send a team of people to put a human in the car and drive the poor passenger out of the conundrum that he was in. And this is very recent. And you have to ask yourself, if we are having a car that supposedly is fully self-driving, so there\xe2\x80\x99s no driver, but we have to have a team of four to six people managing that one car for problems. First of all, that\xe2\x80\x99s not scalable.\n\nIntervention needed\n\nAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s not really self-driving if there has to be so much intervention. And if that\xe2\x80\x99s where we are in technology today, how are we going to make a business out of this? And John Krafcik, the former CEO of Waymo, I mean, he recently left. I feel like John, in that way, was basically admitting what I have been trying to tell people all these years, is that we just can\xe2\x80\x99t solve this problem in the way that you think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to. We need to completely clean sheet this and start over.\n\nWood: So when we see Uber and Lyft, for example, essentially exiting this self-driving car business, do you think it is a sign of companies who have sort of said \xe2\x80\x9cthis is just a money pit\xe2\x80\x9d?\n\nCummings: Yes, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly right.\n\nWood: On the other hand, we have Tesla, which is not doing any of that. What are we to make of that?\n\nCummings: Well, I think the Tesla situation is a little different. Should they be allowed to call their driving assist technology Full Self-Driving? So that\xe2\x80\x99s one problem. And then, if you want to ask, is Tesla ever going to have a robotaxi program? I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you, that answer is no. But that problem is less acute for Tesla, because they have what is otherwise a great product. I love Tesla cars. I just think Autopilot and especially Full Self-Driving are both overhyped, and they underdeliver in terms of performance, and they\xe2\x80\x99re dangerous.\n\nWood: So there\xe2\x80\x99s a math problem and there is a pretty significant marketing problem?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe religion of Tesla\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nCummings: That\xe2\x80\x99s right. So I think that we\xe2\x80\x99re starting to see increasing numbers of crashes in this country and abroad, where drivers think that their car is far more capable. I think what is interesting to me was how the Tesla driver who got arrested for being in his backseat while he was driving vocalized that he\xe2\x80\x99d already been warned once, and he defied the warning and did it again, and then said he would keep doing it because he knows Elon [Musk] knows what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing. And he fully believes in Tesla.\n\nAnd so what I find most interesting about that statement is that one man is vocalizing what so many people believe. They believe that this technology really can be fully self-driving, despite all the warnings and despite all the statements and the owner\xe2\x80\x99s manual, and you having to agree that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to pay attention. Despite all of those warnings, there\xe2\x80\x99s some belief likely based in calling a technology Full Self-Driving and calling it Autopilot where people believe in the religion of Tesla full self-driving, and that is dangerous.\n\nRelated links: More insight from Molly Wood\n\nTesla\xe2\x80\x99s website does call the upgrade option Full Self-Driving, but also says the cars can\xe2\x80\x99t drive themselves. Back in March, a Tesla engineer told the DMV that despite Elon Musk\xe2\x80\x99s claims that the company would have a fully self-driving car by the end of this year, that claim did not match the engineering reality. For a refresher, there are five agreed-upon levels of autonomous driving, where No. 1 is you driving your car with your hands and feet, and No. 5 is the car doing everything while you sleep in the back seat in a way that does not endanger you or everyone around you. The Tesla engineer told the DMV, according to a memo produced by the agency, that Tesla is currently at level 2 \xe2\x80\x94 some self-driving functionality, but requiring a human with hands on the wheel at all times.\n\nHere is a column about deep learning and why that author also thinks the tech is too limited to be able to adapt to real-world conditions, because the algorithms would have to pre-learn every single possible thing that could happen on the road \xe2\x80\x94 from a kudzu stop sign to a spaceship landing on the freeway. There\xe2\x80\x99s also a little more reading and listening on Uber and Lyft getting out of the self-driving game. Marketplace\xe2\x80\x99s Meghan McCarty Carino covered that on the \xe2\x80\x9cMarketplace Morning Report.\n\n\n\nApple might still be working on this \xe2\x80\x94 maybe? It got a patent in March for a night-vision tech system to let its self-driving cars see in the dark. Earlier this week, MacReports noted that Apple has increased the number of self-driving cars it\xe2\x80\x99s registered with the DMV from 66 to 68, but dramatically decreased the number of people licensed to operate those cars. And it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t applied for a driverless testing permit. Apple has been flirting off and on with self-driving cars for a few years now. First it laid off almost everyone involved with its so-called Project Titan, and then it bought a self-driving car startup that was almost defunct. So I guess that puts them in the second category of technologists that Missy Cummings described. We\xe2\x80\x99ll call them the self-driving Dorys \xe2\x80\x94 you know, the fish that just keeps swimming.'";"Autonomous Cars";"242.txt-Autonomous Cars"

An engaged and fully present driver is required to perform all aspects of the driving task. These technologies do offer tremendous safety promise, as they can prevent or lessen the severity of a crash. CDOT is evaluating how roadway design (striping, pavement markings, and signs) can improve the performance of these driver assistance technologies.\n\nThere are manufacturers and other companies that are interested in testing, deploying and researching vehicles that change the basic architecture of the vehicle or remove the human driver. Understanding innovations in technology and the recent focus on advancing highly automated vehicles limiting the need for a human, the State of Colorado has adopted legislative policy that provides definition to highly automated vehicles or driving systems.

If the exact location of the surrounding objects is known, this technology can provide the absolute vehicle location with assistance from a high amount of map data. When integrated with complimentary technology such as: ultrasonic, inertial motion, digital maps, radar/LiDAR and cameras, GNSS acts as the sixth sense to deliver the positioning performance required by autonomous vehicles.\n\nMany technologies onboard vehicles provide local or relative localization. GNSS provides an absolute localization solution, and with the following technologies can achieve the accuracy and availability requirements of a full autonomous driving solution.\n\nSPAN\xc2\xae GNSS+INS Navigation\n\nWith the growing developments in automotive technology, the need for accurate, reliable and robust ground reference has emerged.

In the remaining conditions, the human driver executes the necessary tasks.\n\nAt level 4, the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s ADS is able to perform all driving tasks independently in certain conditions in which human attention is not required.\n\nFinally, level 5 involves full automation whereby the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s ADS is able to perform all tasks in all conditions, and no driving assistance is required from the human driver. This full automation will be enabled by the application of 5G technology, which will allow vehicles to communicate not just with one another, but also with traffic lights, signage and even the roads themselves.\n\nOne of the aspects of the vehicle technology used in automated vehicles is ACC, or adaptive cruise control. This system is able to adjust the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s speed automatically to ensure that it maintains a safe distance from the vehicles in front of it. This function relies on information obtained using sensors on the vehicle and allows the car to perform tasks such as brake when it senses that it is approaching any vehicles ahead. This information is then processed and the appropriate instructions are sent to actuators in the vehicle, which control the responsive actions of the car such as steering, acceleration and braking. Highly automated vehicles with fully automated speed control are able to respond to signals from traffic lights and other such non-vehicular activities.\n\nWhat are the Advantages?\n\nAutonomous vehicle technology may be able to provide certain advantages compared to human-driven vehicles. One such potential advantage is that they could provide increased safety on the road \xe2\x80\x93 vehicle crashes cause many deaths every year, and automated vehicles could potentially decrease the number of casualties as the software used in them is likely to make fewer errors in comparison to humans. A decrease in the number of accidents could also reduce traffic congestion, which is a further potential advantage posed by autonomous vehicles. Autonomous driving can also achieve this by the removal of human behaviours that cause blockages on the road, specifically stop-and-go traffic.\n\nAnother possible advantage of automated driving is that people who are not able to drive \xe2\x80\x93 due to factors like age and disabilities \xe2\x80\x93 could be able to use automated cars as more convenient transport systems.\n\nAdditional advantages that come with an autonomous car are elimination of driving fatigue and being able to sleep during overnight journeys.'";"Autonomous Cars";"254.txt-Autonomous Cars"

Pennsylvania\xe2\x80\x99s world-class research universities have continually served as a breeding ground for technological advances, with Carnegie Mellon University known as the ""birthplace of self-driving vehicles"" and the University of Pennsylvania\xe2\x80\x99s robotics research program is renowned worldwide. Without doubt, Pennsylvania has emerged as a leading location for on\xe2\x80\x90road testing of HAVs as they steadily advance toward practical use.\n\n\n\nPennDOT has supported these advances in automation through the deployment of Dedicated Short-Range Communication (DSRC) Roadside Units (RSUs) at select signalized intersections to enable communications between the vehicles and the infrastructure. PennDOT has also been active in national efforts to develop uniform standards and practices for HAVs. With the pace of HAV innovation accelerating, Transportation Secretary Yassmin Gramian, P.E., challenged PennDOT to take action to sustain Pennsylvania\xe2\x80\x99s leadership in HAV research, while simultaneously ensuring that public safety remains the paramount priority as HAVs are tested on the roadways.\n\nContent Editor \xe2\x80\xad[2]\xe2\x80\xac\n\n\n\n'";"Autonomous Cars";"262.txt-Autonomous Cars"
"265.txt";"b'As of early 2021, multiple rumors have suggested that Apple has entered into negotiations with well-known automative electronics suppliers for components for a potential upcoming vehicle-related product, and Apple is also said to be working to establish a production facility in the United States.\n\nApple was rumored to be cosidering a partnership with Hyundai for manufacturing the Apple Car, with plans to transition the Apple Car development to its Kia brand as part of an arrangement that could see production happen in the United States, but that hasn\'t panned out.\n\nRumors suggested that under the partnership with Hyundai, Hyundai Mobis would be in charge of design and production for some Apple Car components, and Hyundai Group affiliate Kia would provide the U.S. production line for Apple Cars. Hyundai executives were said to be divided over the prospect of a deal with Apple, though Apple planned to invest 4 trillion won ($3.6 billion) in Kia Motors, with Kia set to manufacture the Apple Car in its U.S. facility located in Georgia.\n\nApple reportedly considered Hyundai-Kia because the deal would give Apple access to an established automaker with the capability to produce vehicles in North America. Hyundai-Kia was also willing to give Apple control over both the Apple Car software and the hardware, with Apple planning for a full Apple-branded vehicle and not a Kia model that included Apple software.\n\nDespite all the rumors of an Apple/Hyundai-Kia partnership, Apple paused the talks and has also been discussing Apple Car plans with other automobile manufacturers. According to Bloomberg, Apple was upset that Hyundai confirmed that it was in talks with Apple even though Hyundai eventually retracted and revised the statement.\n\nHyundai and its Kia affiliate confirmed in February 2021 that they are not in discussions with Apple to cooperate on the development of a self-driving electric vehicle, so it appears the discussions between Apple and the two car manufacturing companies may have been tabled for now. It\'s not clear if the talks will resume, but some Korean media sites do believe that the partnership could survive and Apple could opt to go with Kia.\n\nApple also allegedly approached Nissan about a potential partnership, but negotiations were brief and did not make it up to executive levels due to disagreements over Apple Car specifics. The two companies clashed over the idea of a partnership, with Nissan worried that Apple would downgrade it to a simple hardware supplier. Apple wants full control over the Apple Car\'s design and software, and Nissan has said that it has no plans to change the way that it makes cars. Nissan has since confirmed that it is not in talks with Apple.\n\nAccording to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple\'s initial vehicle chassis could be based on Hyundai\'s E-GMP electriv vehicle (BEV) platform, which uses up to two motors, five-link rear suspension, an integrated drive axle, battery cells that can provide range over 500km on a full charge, and can be charged up to 80% within 18 minutes through high-speed charging. A high performance model based on E-GMP is capable of accelerating from 0-60 miles per hour in less than 3.5 seconds, with a top speed of 160 miles per hour.\n\nApple may also work with General Motors and European manufacturer PSA for subsequent models or in other markets. Apple\'s ""deep collaboration"" with manufacturing partners will shorten Apple car development time.\n\nBloomberg\'s Mark Gurman has explained that Apple is struggling to find an appropriate existing automaker to build its vehicle and automakers are said to be concerned about the implications of such an agreement on their own brand. As a result, Apple is reportedly looking into contract manufacturers such as Foxconn, which has an existing relationship with the company.\n\nFoxconn is the main assembler of iPhones, and also recently unveiled an electric vehicle chassis and a software platform to help carmakers bring models to market faster. Contract manufacturer Magna is purportedly another possibility, but Apple may also choose to manufacture the vehicle itself.\n\nAccording to The Korea Times, Apple is ""very near"" to signing an agreement with LG Magna e-Powertrain. Apple is apparently comfortable with LG Magna e-Powertrain\'s smaller manufacturing capacity, from which it may be inferred that the company does not intend to produce the vehicle on the same large scale as other major automakers. Apple\'s first-generation of electric vehicles is reportedly seen as an opportunity to evaluate the project\'s marketability, rather than a true mass-market vehicle.\n\nIf the agreement with LG Magna e-Powertrain is reached, the two parties will then jointly establish the precise details for the production of the Apple car, and a prototype will apparently be teased in early 2024.\n\nApple in June 2021 entered into ""early-stage talks"" with two Chinese companies that might supply batteries for a future Apple Car. Apple is discussing battery options with CATL and BYD, with Apple pushing for the building of manufacturing facilities in the United States.\n\nApple may instead be planning to work with Taiwanese manufacturers on batteries that are could be made in the U.S. Taiwan-based Foxconn and Advanced Lithium Electrochemistry both plan to set up factories in the United States that could end up manufacturing batteries for the Apple Car.\n\nApple in 2021 also sent a team of Apple Car employees to South Korea to meet with LG, the SK group, and others to discuss possible business opportunities related to the Apple Car. Apple is continuing to work to find new partners to join its supply chain for the upcoming vehicle. Apple is pursuing companies who can make lithium iron phosphate batteries, which Korean suppliers mass produce.\n\nApple in September was rumored to be visiting Toyota as talks to find and secure suppliers continue.'";"Autonomous Cars";"265.txt-Autonomous Cars"
"266.txt";"b""Two of Apple's self-driving cars operating in manual mode were involved in minor collisions in August, according to the California DMV.\n\n\n\nThe first incident [PDF] occurred in San Diego, California in the Hillcrest area on August 19. The Lexus RX 450h was stopped in traffic and was hit by a Hyundai. The accident was described as minor with no injuries.\n\nThe second accident [PDF] occurred on August 23 in Cupertino, California, right near the Apple Park campus. The vehicle with Apple's self-driving equipment was in manual mode and it was stopped in traffic when it was rear ended by a Subaru Outback.\n\nBoth of these incidents were not the fault of the self-driving vehicle or the person operating the vehicle, and are largely not notable. What is interesting, though, is that Apple vehicles were involved in two collisions in the same month after no accidents since September 2019.\n\nEarlier this year, the California DMV's disengagement and mileage reports suggested that Apple's Lexus SUVs with self-driving software traversed more than 18,000 miles in 2020, a steep increase compared to prior years. It's possible that Apple has ramped up its testing in 2021, leading to a higher number of incidents.\n\nApple has been testing its self-driving software since early 2017, using the aforementioned Lexus RX 450h vehicles outfitted with sensors and cameras. The work on autonomous driving is part of Apple's longtime car project, and rumors suggest Apple is planning to release a vehicle in the mid to late 2020s.""";"Autonomous Cars";"266.txt-Autonomous Cars"
"267.txt";"b'Last Updated 9/222020\n\nAccording to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA),""autonomous"" or ""self-driving"" vehicles are those in which operation of the vehicle occurs without direct driver input to control the steering, acceleration, and braking and are designed so that the driver is not expected to constantly monitor the roadway while operating in self-driving mode. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers predict that 75% of cars on the roads in the world will be autonomous by 2040. Moreover, a 2018 KPMG Study predicts that self-driving cars may become a commercial reality in the next five years.\n\nGoogle is the pioneer in autonomous driving technology. In 2005, Google established a team of engineers, led by Sebastian Thrun, who developed a robotic vehicle that won a contest sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Since 2009, Google (now Waymo), has been test-driving autonomous vehicles on public roads, traveling more than 10 million miles in over 25 U.S. cities. According to previous crash reports, Waymo cars have been in numerous minor accidents, but only one accident in 2016, was reported to be the fault of Google\'s self-driving car. In 2017, the company removed monthly accidents reports from their site and they will no longer be publicly available.\n\nWaymo continues to be the industry leader in driverless technology. In December of 2018, the company officially launched Waymo One, the nation\xe2\x80\x99s first autonomous vehicle taxi service, in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nGoogle believes that self-driving cars can make driving more efficient and safer by eliminating distracted driving and other human error. According to NHTSA, 3,166 fatalities in 2017 were crashes involving distracted drivers, while an additional 10,874 fatalities involved an alcohol-impaired driver. A KMPG report predicts that by 2050, the adoption of autonomous vehicle technology could reduce the frequency of accidents by almost 90%.\n\nAs excitement and momentum for self-driving cars grows, there are numerous insurance questions that will need to be addressed before such vehicles take the road. For example: What happens if a self-driving car gets into an accident? Who is liable for the damages? Will the human ""copilot"" be at fault or will the car\'s manufacturer? Will the \'driver\' have to maintain a constant vigil on the road ahead at all times? What are they allowed to do inside the vehicle\xe2\x80\xa6can they nap, read a book or text message while the car does all the navigating? Will they even need a driver\'s license? A 2017 KMPG report highlights the ""chaotic middle"" the auto insurance industry is facing in this new period.\n\nThere is also a long list of safety and legal issues to iron out before self-driving cars hit the road. In September 2017, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) presented, Automated Driving Systems: A Vision for Safety, as part of U.S. Department of Transportation\'s (DOT) multimodal efforts to support the safe introduction of automation technologies. In July 2018, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) released the Comprehensive Management Plan for Automated Vehicle Initiatives as a response to the requirements in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (Omnibus Bill) signed into law on March 23, 2018, directing the (DOT) to conduct research on the development of Automated Vehicles (AV).\n\nCurrently, twenty-nine states and Washington D.C. have enacted legislation related to autonomous vehicles, while eleven governors issued executive orders regarding autonomous vehicles. Getting the technology to make the vehicles is only half the challenge; the other half will be creating a legal, liability and regulatory framework to govern their use on public streets.\n\nStatus: The NAIC Innovation and Technology (EX) Task Force is charged with monitoring emerging technologies like autonomous vehicles in the insurance sector. The Task Force provides a forum for discussion of innovation and technology developments in the insurance sector to provide resources for and educate state insurance regulators on how these developments impact consumer protection, insurer, and producer oversight. Additionally, the NAIC Center for Insurance Policy and Research (CIPR) held an Autonomous Vehicle forum in October 2018. Resources from this forum are available on the CIPR Events page. The CIPR also hosted a webinar, The Road Ahead for Autonomous Vehicles and Auto Insurance in December 2019. Both of these events provided insights on the future of insurance in the autonomous vehicle industry.'";"Autonomous Cars";"267.txt-Autonomous Cars"
"271.txt";"b'Autonomous vehicles are also known as self-driving cars, driverless cars, or robotic cars. The term self-driving car is becoming a standard as these technologies continue to mature.\n\nAutonomous vehicles rely on advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) systems to \xe2\x80\x9cunderstand\xe2\x80\x9d their environment and react to commands. Complex sensors and actuators, together with advanced computer vision functions are used to create a constantly updated map of their surroundings, detect the presence of nearby vehicles and pedestrians, measure distances and detect uneven surfaces in roads and sidewalks. Autonomous vehicles can also be interconnected with other external devices such as smart traffic lights and roads, although many of these ideas are still hypothetical.\n\nAn autonomous vehicle is a vehicle that can drive itself without input from a human driver. There are several types of self-driving vehicles, depending on their level of automation. These levels have been defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) which has set 6 of them adopted by the U.S. Department of Transportation ranging from Level 0 (fully manual) to Level 5 (fully autonomous).\n\nTechopedia Explains Autonomous Vehicle\n\nIn some ways, the story of the autonomous vehicle is a tale of technological evolution that is not finished yet, a gradual advance of integrated artificial intelligence services and sensor-based driver safety features that may or may not eventually replace human drivers entirely.\n\nAutonomous cars must rely on the presence of sensors situated in various parts of the vehicle to sense their surroundings. Lidar is mostly used for ranging purposes, measure distances, identify lane markings and anomalies such as holes and pits on the road.\n\nRadar sensors are used to track other vehicles, while video cameras can be used to read road signs and detect traffic lights. Advanced AI-powered software will then process all those inputs coming from sensors, and generate instructions to the car\xe2\x80\x99s actuators to plot paths, control steering, braking and acceleration, or dodge obstacles.\n\nEarly Advances in Autonomous Vehicles\n\nThe earliest edge of the autonomous driving frontier was the evolution of multiple driver safety features that are now standard in many new vehicles. For example, a lane departure warning system alerts drivers if the vehicle seems to be leaving a particular space on a multilane road. Parking assist features, automated braking, and other features also apply. Each one has its own specialized function and controls a given task.\n\nWhat these systems have in common is that, although they promote the idea of autonomous vehicle design, they still do not approach what some would call a self-driving car. The human driver is still in control, and needs to be in control, but utilizes the warnings and alerts to make better driving decisions.\n\nThese forms of partial automation that still require a human driver pertain to the SAE levels 0 to 2. Only when the automated system is in charge of monitoring the driving environment and human intervention is purely optional then a vehicle could be defined as \xe2\x80\x9cautonomous\xe2\x80\x9d (levels 3 to 5). As we progress toward autonomous vehicle design, intermediate types of autopilot systems are becoming more common, with Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s one being probably the most prominent.\n\nObstacles to Adoption of Autonomous Cars Technology\n\nFully autonomous (Level 5) vehicles are currently being tested, but we\xe2\x80\x99re still far from making them available to the general public. Although the autonomous vehicle has come a long way, it is not yet a common mode of transportation, and various obstacles to adoption apply.\n\nIn particular, some of the technologies required for build a functional self-driving car very expensive, making the final cost of each vehicle prohibitive for the general public. Radar and Lidar work for prototypes, but if mass production is achieved, their signals and frequency might interfere with one another.\n\nMany anomalous conditions such as snow, debris or oil may represent a significant challenge whenever they cover lane markings and dividers. Also, it\xe2\x80\x99s still early to trust AI to be smart enough to make consistent decisions or split-second judgement calls in life-or-death scenarios, such as when a pedestrian suddenly traverses the road after a steep turn.'";"Autonomous Cars";"271.txt-Autonomous Cars"
"273.txt";"b'With the explosion of data, every application is now a data application. Learn why this has hundreds of software teams building their applications in the cloud across multiple use cases and industries.\n\nPresented by Pony.ai\n\nThe vision of safe, reliable autonomous vehicle transportation at scale is closer than ever to being realized, says James Peng, CEO at Pony.ai. Since the company\xe2\x80\x99s founding in Fremont, California in late 2016, the company\xe2\x80\x99s been making strides in autonomous mobility deployment in both the U.S. and China. The company was the first to launch and offer a public-facing Robotaxi service in both countries.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe technology is moving from experience-level to application,\xe2\x80\x9d Peng says. \xe2\x80\x9cThe first half of the game is to build stable and mature products and accumulate experience. The second half is to move from R&D to mass production and scale, in addition to achieving commercially viable products.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn 2019, Peng predicted that the world would see a wide adoption of fully autonomous driving vehicles on the open roads within five years, and that forecast is gaining momentum. Pony.ai just received a driverless permit from California DMV, a milestone for their engineers to perform driverless testing without a human driver behind the wheel on public roads within the state. These tests are accelerating commercial growth across their operation sites worldwide, and they plan to launch driverless Robotaxi service to the public in California starting in 2022.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m pretty confident that in many of the larger cities in the U.S., people will soon be able to ride with a driverless Robotaxi vehicle,\xe2\x80\x9d says Tiancheng Lou, CTO at Pony.ai. \xe2\x80\x9cA significant portion of taxi services will be supported by driverless vehicles.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPony.ai currently offers ride-hailing in its autonomous vehicles in five markets: Irvine and Fremont in California; as well as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou in China. The company plans to install its technology in hundreds of vehicles next year, rising to tens of thousands in 2024-2025.\n\nWaymo, Google\xe2\x80\x99s self-driving car arm, has been piloting a fleet of fully driverless robotaxis in Phoenix for the past year, while Amazon-owned Zoox unveiled its autonomous robotaxi service last December.\n\nThe goals of autonomous driving\n\nAccording to most companies, the biggest benefit of autonomous driving is safety. The U.S. Department of Transportation has reported that 94% of car crashes are caused by human error. While overall driving was down in 2020 because of the pandemic, traffic fatality rates surged 24% \xe2\x80\x94 the highest spike in nearly a century. Autonomous driving is the solution to this issue, Peng says, and companies like Pony.ai, Google, and Uber, along with most of the major automakers, are sinking considerable money into R&D, optimistic about the future of autonomous driving.\n\nA transition to autonomous vehicles also has potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and support U.S. economic growth, points out the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets. The coalition, which includes members Ford, Volvo, Lyft, Uber, and Waymo, promotes the benefits of fully self-driving vehicles and supports the fastest deployment possible \xe2\x80\x93 or advancing the scale of the technology, which would enable mass production and start moving autonomous vehicles to the center of the smart city vision.\n\nChallenges of driving autonomy at scale\n\nPony is hoping to achieve large enough scale to reduce costs and meet commercial needs by 2022 with Alpha X, the working name for their latest generation of autonomous vehicles, Lou says, which are designed to be manufactured on a production line.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo have a large number of vehicles, we need to manufacture them in a standardized way,\xe2\x80\x9d Lou says. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a critical step to achieve front-loading mass production of self-driving cars.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe company established a production line and a set of standardized processes specifically for L4-level autonomous driving systems last November. With the support of the production line, the production efficiency of the autonomous driving system doubled six times compared with the previous generation, and production pace accelerated.\n\nWith PonyAlpha X, they established a L4 level autonomous driving system scale production line, Lou says. To manufacture the vehicle, they established a supply chain management process, hardware module design and verification, test production, and car conversion before final assembly. The end phase consists of overall quality inspection, off-line calibration, and road testing. The project helps them set up a standardized production process, which shortened production time, effectively reduced costs, and improved the stability of the overall system.\n\nCompared with the previous generation, PonyAlpha X is more compact, integrated, and lightweight in terms of system hardware integration, reducing the cost of post-maintenance. They recently partnered with Toyota to equip PonyAlpha X on Lexus RX models.\n\nIn February of this year, the company rolled out the new self-driving vehicles equipped with the latest generation system from the standardized production line. The cars will go through all-day autonomous-driving open-road tests in Guangzhou, Beijing, and Shanghai before they join the company\xe2\x80\x99s Robotaxi fleet for large-scale operations.\n\nTheir recent partnership with Luminar, an autonomous vehicle sensor and software company, has also allowed them to significantly bring down the cost of manufacturing, which is always a major hurdle for mass production.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the next generation, one of the biggest challenges is we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to use auto-grade sensors,\xe2\x80\x9d Lou says. \xe2\x80\x9cOne of the critical pieces is Luminar LiDAR. Using that LiDAR, we\xe2\x80\x99re moving one step toward to being ready for mass production, and then we can prepare for large scale production. Luminar LiDAR, compared to our current solution, is more reliable and much cheaper.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLiDAR is a laser sensor that sends millions of laser points out per second and measures how long they take to bounce back, a key component to safe autonomous driving. Luminar says that its Iris LiDAR has a maximum range of 500 meters (1,640 feet), including 250-meter range with less than 10 percent reflectivity. The self-driving sensor solution offers better perception accuracy and field of view breadth to enhance the ability to cope with long-tail scenarios. The new pony vehicles with Luminar\xe2\x80\x99s LiDAR sensor will be up and running in 2022, and will be ready for the company\xe2\x80\x99s robotaxi customers in 2023.\n\nAutonomous driving at scale is, literally, in sight\n\nThe past year hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been easy, Lou says, but it pushed their contactless delivery initiative further along in Irvine, which helped the community cope during the pandemic, while adding testing and collecting mileage for data points. But full autonomy at scale still requires testing.\n\nTo help accelerate their commercial growth and global deployment, they\xe2\x80\x99ve tapped Lawrence Steyn, vice chairman of investment banking at JPMorgan Chase & Co, as chief financial officer.\n\nAnd looking ahead, in 10 years or 20 years, it could be possible that owning a vehicle would entirely be a luxury, Lou says.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe need to carefully think about whether that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary, having personal vehicles,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it\xe2\x80\x99s mathematically possible to get a vehicle within as little as 30 seconds, most people may not have to own a vehicle.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe also points out that if most vehicles are running autonomously, the vehicle form factor can be reshaped for accessibility, opening up safe transportation for a larger population of older and disabled riders who could turn to cheaper, more efficient autonomous transportation for their travel needs.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI still keep the engineering part in me, and with that part, I dream of pushing the world forward with state-of-art technology,\xe2\x80\x9d Peng says. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are working hard to largely scale and deploy our technology across countries and regions to benefit more and more people.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDig deeper.

"275.txt";"b'These Vehicles Can Almost Drive Themselves There is no such thing as a self-driving car. Let\xe2\x80\x99s make that clear right away, not a single car on the road today can operate in all types of weather and driving conditions without any human intervention. That type of vehicle, one with what\xe2\x80\x99s called Level 5 autonomy (which we\'ll explain in further detail later), remains years into the future. This doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean many cars on sale today don\xe2\x80\x99t have impressive technology that\xe2\x80\x99s making them increasingly smarter and safer. Some of these driving aids are targeted at reducing driver stress, by taking over some or all steering functions, or automatically matching the car\xe2\x80\x99s speed to posted road signs. Certain systems, like Cadillac\xe2\x80\x99s Super Cruise, can only be used within specific parameters, such as pre-mapped divided highways with dedicated on- and off-ramps. There are also a number of active safety features, such as automatic emergency braking, that help minimize the risk of an accident by stopping the car if sensors detect an obstacle. While the era of robot cars hasn\xe2\x80\x99t yet arrived, let\xe2\x80\x99s look at examples of self-driving technology available today.\n\n<h3><strong>What Are the Levels of Vehicle Autonomy?</strong></h3> <p>To make things as simple as possible, let\xe2\x80\x99s explain the five levels of vehicle autonomy before we look at the cars and SUVs on this list. The levels of autonomy are determined by SAE International, a professional group of worldwide engineers devoted to establishing standardized values for the transportation field. To better understand self-driving cars, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand each level of autonomy.</p> <p>Level 0 means the car is always under human control. Cars in this category can have active safety features, like automatic emergency braking and forward collision warning, but these features only offer visual or audible alerts, and they never actively control the car.</p> <p>Level 1 vehicles might include adaptive cruise control or lane keep assist. These safety features are capable of providing a small degree of steering, acceleration, or braking input. However, their primary focus is accident avoidance. </p> <p>Level 2 autonomy entails several active safety features working in unison to take some degree of driving duty away from the driver. Onboard cameras and radar sensors could keep the car driving at a steady speed in its intended lane of travel, for example, and clear of surrounding vehicles. At this level you\xe2\x80\x99ll find a number of today\xe2\x80\x99s self-driving systems, such as Cadillac Super Cruise and Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s AutoPilot. One key thing to remember: A Level 2 vehicle requires the driver to remain focused on the road. This can be done via cameras that monitor the driver\xe2\x80\x99s eyes or sensors that can tell if the driver lets go of the steering wheel.</p> <p>At Level 3, a vehicle takes over all driving controls in select conditions and allows the driver to focus elsewhere. These conditions might be specific types of highway, or geofenced locations. The vehicle may not be able to drive itself in poor weather.</p> <p>At Level 4, the self-driving car is able to adapt to more road and weather conditions. The limitations of Level 3 are lessened, and the vehicle theoretically requires almost no driver input.</p> <p>Finally, at Level 5, the car drives all the time, no matter the type of road or weather outside. This robo-car is the end game for self-driving technology, though it remains years into the future.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>2020 Tesla Model S</strong></h3> <p><strong>Price w/ Autonomous Driving Features: $69,420 | U.S. News Overall Score: 9.0/10</strong></p> <p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s start with the car company and electric-powered sedan that put self-driving technology on the map. True, the idea of robo-cars didn\xe2\x80\x99t start with Tesla, but the Silicon Valley-based automaker has put them front and center in terms of cutting-edge car technology. </p> <p>Every <a href=""/cars-trucks/tesla/model-s/2020"">Model S</a> is fitted with Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s AutoPilot self-driving aid, though you can upgrade to the Full Self-Driving Capability package for an extra $8,000. While AutoPilot maintains vehicle speed and keeps the Model S in its intended lane of travel, Full Self-Driving Capability allows for lane changes (if the sensors detect it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to do so), automatic parking assist, and a mode to summon the car from a parking spot. </p> <p>Tesla remains at the forefront of this technology, though the company\xe2\x80\x99s reputation has been dinged by high profile accidents while its vehicles were operating with some degree of autonomy. This has often been linked to driver inattention, though the fact that AutoPilot usage is not geo-fenced to certain roads \xe2\x80\x93 such as the next system we\xe2\x80\x99re going to discuss \xe2\x80\x93 has been a heated safety topic.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>2020 Cadillac CT6</strong></h3> <p><strong>Price w/ Autonomous Driving Features: $74,495 | U.S. News Overall Score: 7.2/10</strong></p> <p>While Tesla has adopted a more free-spirited attitude to self-driving assistance, the Cadillac Super Cruise system takes a more measured approach. Like Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s AutoPilot, when Super Cruise is in operation the car maintains its speed, distance to other vehicles, and adheres to its intended lane of travel. </p> <p>Unlike some rival lane keep assist technology, Super Cruise is credited for being very smooth and avoiding the \xe2\x80\x98ping-pong\xe2\x80\x99 feel that other systems cause as onboard sensors read and respond to lane markings. This is a hands-free system, but a camera in the interior keeps an eye on the driver to make certain they\xe2\x80\x99re looking ahead and paying attention. If that isn\xe2\x80\x99t the case, Super Cruise will issue a series of visual and audible alerts. Should this still not get the driver\xe2\x80\x99s attention, the car will turn on its hazard lights and slow to a stop in its lane of travel.</p> <p>Available on the <a href=""/cars-trucks/cadillac/ct6/2020"">CT6</a> luxury sedan in the Premium Luxury trim level, Super Cruise can only be activated on divided highways with dedicated on-ramps and off-ramps. </p> <p>As of this writing, roughly 130,000 miles of roads throughout North America have been programmed into Super Cruise.

"278.txt";"b'While the major automakers are developing autonomous vehicles behind closed doors, we were able to experience Audi\xe2\x80\x99s latest prototype at Las Vegas\xe2\x80\x99 CES show in January. California, Florida, Michigan, and Nevada are the only states, along with Washington, D.C., that currently allow companies to test such vehicles on public roads.\n\nAudi\xe2\x80\x99s A7 test car is equipped with the company\xe2\x80\x99s traffic-jam assist feature, which uses an array of cameras, sensors, and radar to let the car take over the driving in highway traffic. In the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat was Bj\xc3\xb6rn Giesler, Ph.D., project leader for development of piloted driving at Audi AG, and in the backseat was an engineer equipped with a laptop and radio to monitor the system and communicate with our police escorts and other Audi vehicles.\n\nDuring rush-hour traffic, we headed out on Route 15, one of Las Vegas\xe2\x80\x99 major freeways. With the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s speed under 40 mph, a notification appeared that the system\xe2\x80\x99s pilot mode was available. Then with the push of a button on the steering wheel, the car took control and the instrument cluster graphic changed to an illustration of the road with vehicles in the lanes.\n\nAs Giesler took his hands off the wheel and his foot off the pedals, the vehicle seamlessly followed the car in front at a safe distance. When a vehicle cut into our lane, the A7 automatically slowed down and adjusted the distance. When that car moved out of the lane, our car again closed the gap with the next car in front. The driver can turn off the system at any time by placing his hands on the steering wheel and foot back on the pedals.\n\nWith the A7 in control, the driver could do other things, although sleeping was not one of them. The vehicle was equipped with two cameras with facial recognition that monitored the driver\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. Giesler showed off that feature in an unnerving moment. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to lie to you, this is still pretty scary for me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said as he pretended to sleep. After about 10 seconds the vehicle noticed. An audible alert sounded and, when he still didn\xe2\x80\x99t open his eyes, the vehicle shut down in the middle of the highway and activated the hazard lights. That is a safeguard on the prototype A7 in case the driver is ill or incapacitated. But production cars will be designed so that they can make autonomous lane changes, which will allow the vehicle to safely pull off the road.\n\nDuring the demonstration, Giesler pointed out an eye-opening reminder of how quickly the technology is advancing. The previous year the test car\xe2\x80\x99s trunk was filled with three desktop-sized computers to make the system work. This year the hardware had been reduced to the size of a small box, which was tucked away in the trunk\xe2\x80\x99s side storage compartment.\n\nOverall we were quite impressed with the Audi\xe2\x80\x99s capabilities. The company expects the technology to be available in a production car within five years.'";"Autonomous Cars";"278.txt-Autonomous Cars"

The company, a division of Intel (INTC), describes NYC as \xe2\x80\x9cone of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most challenging driving environments\xe2\x80\x9d and says the data from the trial will push full self-driving capability closer to prime time.\n\nIn an interview, Mobileye CEO Amnon Shashua said fully autonomous cars could be in showrooms by the end of President Biden\xe2\x80\x99s first term. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have contracts underway with car makers for the 2024 or 2025 time frame,\xe2\x80\x9d Shashua told Yahoo Finance. \xe2\x80\x9cA level 4 vehicle can be purchased by a consumer at a very, very reasonable add-on cost.\xe2\x80\x9d Level 4 is the second-highest level of vehicle autonomy and it means a driver is never needed.\n\nSystems on the market today, including Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s Autopilot and General Motors\xe2\x80\x99 Supercruise, are Level 2 autonomy, which means computers can control steering and speed but the driver needs to be ready to intervene if necessary. Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s system has been controversial because of several fatal crashes that occurred with Autopilot engaged. Drivers may have mistakenly thought the system could avoid all hazards, which it\xe2\x80\x99s not yet designed to do. The Transportation Department\'s safety agency is investigating at least 30 Tesla crashes involving 10 deaths.\n\nMobileye\xe2\x80\x99s CEO Amnon Shashua poses with a Mobileye driverless vehicle at the Nasdaq Market site in New York, U.S., July 20, 2021. REUTERS/Jeenah Moon\n\nMobileye and Tesla on different paths\n\nMobileye supplied autonomous systems for Tesla in the past, but the two companies went different directions on the technology. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are on diverging paths,\xe2\x80\x9d Shashua says. \xe2\x80\x9cThere may be places in which we can collaborate again, but being a full stack supplier to Tesla, that is something that was in the past and is not going to occur again.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nStory continues\n\nMobileye\xe2\x80\x99s self-driving systems compete with those being developed by Alphabet\xe2\x80\x99s (GOOG) Waymo division and other suppliers. Tesla is developing its own system. Most automakers, including General Motors (GM) and Ford (F), use proprietary in-house technology along with systems provided by suppliers such as Mobileye. Autonomous vehicles are complex and a handful of sophisticated firms will probably end up dominating the market, which is likely to be lucrative.\n\nShashua sees robotaxis arriving before self-driving cars consumers buy at dealerships. Mobileye, which was an Israeli company before Intel bought it for $15 billion in 2017, has permission to operate driverless taxis in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, most likely by the end of 2022, and in Munich as well. Two programs in California could allow driverless rides for hire on a similar timeframe\n\nMobileye driverless car is seen at the Nasdaq Market site in New York, U.S., July 20, 2021. REUTERS/Jeenah Moon\n\nRobotaxis will come first because companies like Uber or Lyft operating fleets of vehicles will be better able to absorb the cost than individual consumers. Robotaxis may also be easier to regulate, through rules governing their use inside a fixed geography such as a city\xe2\x80\x99s boundaries. Driverless cars for consumers probably need the ability to go virtually anywhere, plus some regulatory guidance that isn\xe2\x80\x99t yet fully developed. Level 4 autonomy could add $10,000 to $15,0000 to the cost of a vehicle, though that should come down as the technology scales up.\n\nThe United States isn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily ahead on autonomous vehicles. \xe2\x80\x9cI think China and Germany are in the lead position,\xe2\x80\x9d Shashua says. China has made self-driving technology one of its top industrial priorities, and Germany, home to Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz and BMW, has legally sanctioned AVs in ways the United States has not.

With that said, a recent report provided by Cox Automotive points out that 84-percent of people surveyed would still prefer the option of driving themselves, leaving just 16-percent of those surveyed willing to give up full control. To make matters worse, the overall acceptance of self-driving technology over the last two years has fallen by 18-percentage points. That probably, at least in part, comes thanks to recent high-profile autonomous car accidents, like the fatal accident with one of Uber\xe2\x80\x99s self-driving cars. As such, it\xe2\x80\x99s not surprising that automakers are scrambling to prove that their autonomous technology is safe \xe2\x80\x93 we can always trust them, right?\n\nIn the video you see below, BMW has chosen one of its autonomous test vehicles with the co-star being none other than a scary-looking ghost in the woods. Naturally, the self-driving car stops in the middle of the road, long before it could run over the scary ghost because, you know, self-driving technology is just that good. As the video proceeds, the ghost opens the car door to find nobody in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat, gets scared, and scurries off into the woods like a very naughty mouse that was caught in your kitchen cupboard. Then we see the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cNOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF\xe2\x80\x9d flash across the screen.\n\nThis video can be seen in one of two ways. The way BMW wants you to see it is that its self-driving technology is so good that it can even stop for a lifeless entity in the middle of a dark wooded road in the middle of the night \xe2\x80\x93 a place where no car (or driver for that matter) really has any business being anyway. That\xe2\x80\x99s great- BMW\xe2\x80\x99s self-driving tech will stop for anything.

Anyway, YAY; it is super safe.\n\nI, on the other hand, look at this video a completely different way. First off, why was this self-driving car in the middle of the darkest, creepiest looking wooded road in the middle of the night? Maybe the car had gone rogue after the passenger stopped to take a leak. A brave soul that would have been. But, I digress. I think the real message here is that even ghosts \xe2\x80\x93 the leftover souls of those that once walked this earth \xe2\x80\x93 are scared of self-driving technology. Now, that, my friends, is something to take note of. If a creepy ghost walking down a dark road in the middle of the night, with clear intentions of scaring the hell out of someone, is scared of self-driving cars, then shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we be scared of them as well?

"285.txt";"b'TOKYO -- Prices of one key type of the sensors used in autonomous cars are falling rapidly, raising hopes of accelerating progress in the development of self-driving technology.\n\nVelodyne Lidar, the leading manufacturer of lidar sensors, has developed a product with a price only one-hundredth of those up until now. This dramatic drop in price for the sensors at the heart of many autonomous car designs could rev up the speed of the evolution of self-driving vehicles.\n\nMost of today\'s autonomous vehicles are equipped with two key types of sensors: cameras and radars.\n\nSensors using lidar (light detection and ranging) work like radar systems, with the only difference being that they use laser light instead of radio waves.\n\nLidar technology uses near-infrared light to detect objects around a vehicle. The advantage of lidar is that it can generate precise three-dimensional images of everything from cars to traffic lights to pedestrians in a wide range of environments and under diverse lighting conditions.\n\nHonda Motor\'s new self-driving Legend luxury sedan, equipped with the world\'s first certified Level 3 autonomous driving technology, uses lidar sensors.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk, however, has famously disparaged lidar sensors, saying in 2019 that they are ""expensive sensors that are unnecessary"" and likening them to ""a whole bunch of expensive appendices.""\n\nMusk has shown such distaste for lidar technology mainly because lidar sensors have been so costly, with a system for one vehicle costing as much as $70,000. He has argued that sophisticated cameras are sufficient for self-driving cars\' vision systems.\n\nIndeed, the biggest hurdle to widespread lidar adoption has been an economic one.\n\nBut technological innovation has significantly undermined the assumption underlying Musk\'s argument.\n\nVelodyne CEO Anand Gopalan told Nikkei that Musk\'s view of lidar technology is ""five, six years out of date.""\n\nGopalan asked whether it is wise to rely on just one component for safety. ""If you\'re driving at 70 miles per hour, or 100 kilometers per hour, you\'re taking your hand off the steering wheel and you\'re shutting your brain off ... can you rely on just one sensor?"" he said.\n\nAs the costs of lidar sensors decline, they can be combined with cameras to create truly safe and affordable vision systems, he asserted. ""If lidar can become small and low-cost, [it will help] create a safe system.""\n\nMany major carmakers have apparently agreed. Velodyne\'s customer list includes Volkswagen and Honda.\n\nVelodyne CEO Anand Gopalan holds the company\'s new palm-size lidar unit.\n\nWhen Google initially started its autonomous vehicle research, it used custom-made lidar sensors from Velodyne. They were rotating models mounted on the roof.\n\nVelodyne has sharply reduced lidar production costs by developing solid-state lidars. This new approach has helped shrink the size of the sensors, eliminate moving parts in the optical mechanisms and enable the kind of mass manufacturing that has brought costs down.\n\nThe company\'s new model, its smallest so far, could be sold at around $100 in high-volume production. A sensor system composed of multiple lidars is capable of 360-degree vehicle coverage.\n\nAs the costs of making lidars fall further through mass production, the total cost of lidars per vehicle will likely fall sharply. ""Past 2025, I think you will see the cost of lidars come down even more, in the $700 range"" per vehicle, Gopalan said.\n\nLuminar Technologies, a U.S. vehicle sensor and software startup, has also developed low-priced lidar sensors priced at $500 to $1,000.\n\nLuminar\'s high-performance lidar sensors can accurately detect objects ahead of the car out to 250 meters away and grasp the situation around the vehicle with a perception accuracy of several centimeters. The sensors can also detect dark objects, like black debris or a person wearing black clothes, even on roads with minimum reflectivity.\n\nGermany\'s Daimler, Sweden\'s Volvo Cars, the Israel-based Intel unit Mobileye and Toyota Motor\'s research arm have adopted Luminar\'s lidar sensors for their self-driving prototypes.\n\nLuminar CEO Austin Russell stresses the crucial importance of focusing on safety in developing self-driving technologies. One accident per 100 people is not acceptable, Russell told Nikkei. The goal should be ""to have 99.99999999% -- 10 nines of reliability,"" he said.\n\nRussell was a child prodigy who memorized the whole periodic table at age 2 and made a cellphone on his own while he was an elementary school student. He obtained a patent for a water recycling system he invented when he was 13.\n\nUnder the guidance of billionaire Peter Thiel, a co-founder of PayPal, Russell founded Luminar at the age of 17. Following Luminar\'s listing on Nasdaq in December 2020 through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) -- a shell company that uses the proceeds from an IPO to acquire a private company -- he became a billionaire at age 25.\n\nBesides Luminar, more than five other U.S. lidar startups, including California-based Aeva, have gone public via a SPAC merger.\n\nIn recent years, progress in autonomous driving technology has been markedly slower than that for electric vehicles. One reason has been a rush of major automakers to expand their EV offerings in response to a global trend toward stricter regulatory restrictions on gasoline-powered cars aimed at reducing carbon emissions.\n\nAs their earnings have been battered by the COVID-19 pandemic, carmakers have concentrated their investment on electric vehicles while cutting their R&D spending on self-driving technology.\n\nThe walls of national regulations and high costs have also hampered the advancement of autonomous driving technology. But growing competition among Velodyne and its rivals to develop more accurate and less expensive lidar sensors could help the technology overcome these challenges and come into widespread use.\n\n""Various parts with falling prices, such as sensors and cameras, will help remedy shortcomings [of autonomous driving],"" said professor Toshio Ito at the Shibaura Institute of Technology, an expert in advanced driver assistance systems.\n\nA small number of players, mainly U.S. and Chinese tech companies, are dominating the self-driving business landscape due primarily to its high technological and financial hurdles.\n\nGeneral Motors\' autonomous driving subsidiary, GM Cruise; Waymo, which began as Google\'s self-driving car project; and China\'s Baidu are leading the pack in terms of testing self-driving cars on public roads in California and other parts of the U.S. They have covered far more distance than Daimler or Toyota.\n\nIn a notable strategic move by another tech giant, Amazon acquired the autonomous vehicle startup Zoox to develop driverless delivery vehicles.\n\nApple is another tech powerhouse that is raising its self-driving profile. Since 2017, the Palo Alto, California-based company has been test-driving its own models on public roads around its headquarters. According to documents the company submitted in the past to the state authority, Apple has been testing a Lexus-based self-driving vehicle. A Lexus equipped with self-driving systems provided by DeepRoute.ai, a Chinese company, has been spotted in the area.\n\nVelodyne\'s Gopalan welcomes entries by tech companies like those affiliated with Google\'s parent, Alphabet, and Apple into the mobility sector.\n\n""Their appetite to adopt new technologies like lidar ... is much faster than a traditional automotive [manufacturer]. And so their entry into the space has really forced the rest of the industry to innovate,"" he said.\n\nThese U.S. and Chinese tech companies, armed with not just accumulated test-driving data but also ample financial and human resources, are likely to remain on the leading edge of the self-driving revolution.'";"Autonomous Cars";"285.txt-Autonomous Cars"

"289.txt";"b'Friday, June 25, 2021\n\nDespite all the hype, fully self-driving cars are not yet commercially available to the public. In limited geographical areas, individuals can sometimes be passengers in these vehicles. However, mastering the technology behind these cars has proven highly costly, and a wider rollout has taken much longer than expected.\n\nEven Tesla, who offers an \xe2\x80\x9cAutopilot\xe2\x80\x9d feature and boasts that their cars can run by themselves, admits (sometimes) that there needs to be a human at the controls. This is partly because of the accidents that continue to occur when people allow the car to do what it promises to do: drive itself. Clearly, safety continues to be a significant concern.\n\nIn April of this year, a Tesla vehicle was involved in a fatal crash that killed two people. Just before the drive, eyewitnesses said that the parties left to test-drive the vehicle without a driver utilizing Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s Autopilot feature.\n\nTesla claims the accident occurred because there was no one behind the wheel. The company says they include a warning on when and where to use this feature in the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s manual. They also state on their website that active driver supervision is required, yet they continue to advertise the Autopilot feature as autonomous.\n\nSo, before we examine who\xe2\x80\x99s at fault if you\xe2\x80\x99re involved in an accident with a driverless car, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand the complexities surrounding self-driving cars, from what defines the term to current regulations and the latest developments in the industry.\n\nWHAT ARE SELF-DRIVING VEHICLES?\n\nThe terms \xe2\x80\x9cself-driving,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdriverless,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cautonomous\xe2\x80\x9d are often used synonymously, although there are important distinctions.\n\nSelf-driving vehicles have been assigned levels of autonomy by the NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration). Most cars on the road today operate at Level 1, where there are some autonomous functions such as cruise control or Lane-Keep Assist. It\xe2\x80\x99s worth noting that the NHTSA recently updated their descriptions of Levels 4 and 5 to include a greater degree of autonomy and lack of human intervention.\n\nThere has been some reluctance for people to grab onto the self-driving concept. However, according to forecaster Scott Hardman, as driving becomes more automated, people will drive more, based on his interviews with 35 Tesla BEV with Autopilot owners. Those interviewed perceived less stress and increased comfort associated with partial automation.\n\nIn the meantime, technology is moving forward amidst hope, some trepidation, and, most of all, confusion.\n\nESSENTIAL SELF-DRIVING VEHICLE STATS\n\nExact statistics about driverless vehicles are difficult to get due to the lack of mandates on reporting accidents and the lack of industry-wide standards, where confusion abounds. Nevertheless, here are some important numbers worth considering:\n\nMore than 80 companies are testing over 1,400 self-driving cars in the U.S.\n\nAbout half of the population familiar with self-driving cars say they would be willing to ride in them.\n\nThe Tsukuba Mechanical Engineering Laboratory in Japan launched the first primitive, semi-automated car in 1977.\n\nGoogle\xe2\x80\x99s self-driving car first crashed into a bus in February of 2016; there were no injuries.\n\nTesla autonomous vehicles have been involved in several accidents. The first accident that resulted in death occurred in Florida on May 7, 2016.\n\nThe first Uber self-driving car crash occurred on November 20, 2018, in Tempe, Arizona. The cause was human error and resulted in the death of pedestrian Elaine Hezerberg.\n\nUber was involved in 37 crashes prior to the fatal accident in 2018.\n\nWaymo, the self-driving division of Google parent company Alphabet, Inc., partnered with the trucking giant J.B. Hunt and began hauling commercial loads on Texas highways with Level 4 autonomous big-rig vehicles in March of 2020.\n\nWaymo has also been running a driverless taxi service in the Phoenix, Arizona area since 2018. In May of this year, one of these Waymo taxis got confused in Chandler, Arizona traffic and took off on its own. Fortunately, no one was injured.\n\nLyft predicts autonomous rides could arrive by 2023.\n\nMany experts say driverless cars are safer than those driven entirely by human operators. Regardless, accidents have occurred and will continue to take place for many reasons. But if you\xe2\x80\x99re involved in a driverless car accident, who\xe2\x80\x99s at fault? Do you have any recourse?\n\nWHO\xe2\x80\x99S TO BLAME IN A CRASH?\n\nThe blame, or cause, of the accident, can be murky at best and may rest with more than one party. That\xe2\x80\x99s why it is essential to have a professional and experienced personal injury attorney on your side to accurately assess the situation, interpret the data, and consult the right experts to support your case and present it properly to the court.\n\nWHAT TO DO IF YOU\xe2\x80\x99RE IN AN ACCIDENT WITH A DRIVERLESS CAR\n\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re involved in an accident of any kind, you\xe2\x80\x99ll want to seek medical help as soon as possible. Often physical, mental, or emotional trauma doesn\xe2\x80\x99t show up right away, even if you think you weren\xe2\x80\x99t hurt.\n\nBe sure to:'";"Autonomous Cars";"289.txt-Autonomous Cars"

This situation highlights the difficulties facing the automated vehicle industry, which has gotten billions of dollars in investor money over the past decade.\n\nIn the past year, self-driving startups like Cruise and Pony.ai have begun testing their driverless cars in some parts of California. These cars have human operators.\n\nThe human is not \xe2\x80\x9cdriving,\xe2\x80\x9d but sitting in the passenger seat. Called a safety operator, the human ""has a red button that can stop the vehicle just in case anything happens,"" Pony.ai CEO James Peng told the Reuters news agency.\n\nThe operator will be removed next year when Pony.ai, whose investors include Toyota Motor Corp., sends out its driverless vehicles in some areas of California. Still, an operator will supervise vehicles from a distance and give help when the vehicles run into trouble, Peng said.\n\nCruise is majority-owned by General Motors. It started operating five driverless vehicles in San Francisco at night in October 2020. A human was in the front seat. The person has ""the ability to stop the vehicle at any point during the ride,"" a Cruise spokesman told Reuters.\n\n""Cruise views the development of self-driving vehicles as not only a tech race, but also a trust race,\xe2\x80\x9d the spokesman said. He added that humans help with safe driverless vehicle development and help ""build trust with the public.""\n\nIn the face of many technical and legal difficulties, some self-driving companies are accepting the need for human minders.

"291.txt";"b'Last summer, I asked (with a hint of frustration) where my totally self-driving car was. After all, it was 2020, and I had accumulated a slew of statements from years past that promised millions of them would be on the road by then.\n\nNow, we\xe2\x80\x99re well into 2021, and I\xe2\x80\x99m starting to get discouraged.\n\nFirst, Christopher Mims of The Wall Street Journal reported a few weeks ago that some experts now say, despite an accumulated investment of more than $80 billion toward research and technology, that \xe2\x80\x9cwe may never get the self-driving cars we were promised.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThen, I spoke to an expert I\xe2\x80\x99ve known for years, who told me basically the same thing.\n\nActually, that\xe2\x80\x99s not entirely true. Francesco Biondi did tell me we might see such a car, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I think it will probably be toward the end of my lifetime.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe is 33. I don\xe2\x80\x99t stand a chance.\n\nAll those dreams I had of a car that would take me to doctor appointments in my old age, drop me off at the door, park itself, then come get me when I was done? Poof! Up in smoke, like so many semi-autonomous cars that run into things.\n\nBiondi used to be an assistant professor at the University of Utah, where he conducted tests on volunteers who drove back and forth to Wendover in semi-autonomous cars. They drove one way manually and let the car handle much of the driving in the other direction. They wore contraptions that measured brain waves and had video recorders trained on them, which eventually demonstrated that people tend to lose focus when their cars automatically stay in their lanes and brake for traffic ahead.\n\nWhich is a problem, because those cars aren\xe2\x80\x99t really ready to drive themselves.\n\nIn other words, it\xe2\x80\x99s more dangerous to drive today\xe2\x80\x99s semi-autonomous cars than to pilot that old, dusty beater that requires you to do everything \xe2\x80\x94 brake, accelerate, turn, switch on the radio and watch out for the other guy \xe2\x80\x94 all by yourself.\n\nIf your beater has a manual transmission, you don\xe2\x80\x99t even have a hand free to text while driving.\n\nRelated Legislature approves bill allowing driverless cars on Utah roads\n\nToday, Biondi is a fully tenured assistant professor at the University of Windsor, in Canada. His window lets him look across the river toward Detroit, which once was the symbol of America\xe2\x80\x99s booming automobile industry. He\xe2\x80\x99s still very much involved in similar research.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think that the industry assumed it would be much easier,\xe2\x80\x9d he said about self-driving cars. The reason they were wrong is something that ought to make all of us feel proud:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs much as we like to think that humans are not as smart as machines \xe2\x80\xa6 that\xe2\x80\x99s far from being the case. Even after years of testing, autonomous cars are unable to match the human driver\xe2\x80\x99s performances. There are a lot of scenarios \xe2\x80\x94 weather conditions, road conditions \xe2\x80\x94 where these cars are not as smart as we want them to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSo, rogue machines aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to take over the world any time soon. That\xe2\x80\x99s good news, even though it won\xe2\x80\x99t help me get to the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s office as an old man.\n\nAnd yet that message doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be widespread knowledge. At least, that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the case last April in Texas when two men decided to go for a ride in a Tesla, with one apparently in the back seat and the other in the front passenger seat \xe2\x80\x94 and no one behind the wheel.\n\nThe New York Times said their wives overheard the men talking about the car\xe2\x80\x99s autopilot features as they left. They died when the car left the road on a steep turn.\n\nBiondi said evidence shows many people who buy semi-autonomous cars overestimate what they can do. Dealerships sometimes oversell the products or leave out information about limitations.\n\nMims, of The Wall Street Journal, suggests some experts think the whole idea needs to be rethought. They want to approach the necessary artificial intelligence by building systems that learn the way human babies do. Others want to divide the problem into smaller chunks, developing systems that each handle a piece of the puzzle.\n\nBiondi said he thinks commercial trucking shows more promise at the moment, especially if it involves dedicating lanes of traffic for that use only.\n\nTo me, it all sounds long and laborious and so \xe2\x80\xa6 well \xe2\x80\xa6 20th century.\n\nIt also sounds like I\xe2\x80\x99d better be prepared for that day when, as with my Dad and those before him, the kids discreetly take my keys from me and, in my decrepit state, I have to bum a ride to the doctor.

"292.txt";"b'The most remarkable thing about a ride in a robot car is how unremarkable it is.\n\nIt is definitely eerie to see the steering wheel turn by itself, the car brake and change lanes without human intervention. But just as with cruise control, it soon feels commonplace.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been covering autonomous driving for several years so I\xe2\x80\x99ve taken lots of these rides \xe2\x80\x94 often carefully choreographed to show the cars to best advantage.\n\nFive years ago, I perched nervously in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat of a self-driving Uber Ford Fusion in Pittsburgh, ready to take the wheel as it crisscrossed the city\xe2\x80\x99s notorious bridges. I chugged around the campus of Santa Clara University in a converted golf cart from Auro Robotics, and barreled down Interstate 280 in a self-driving big rig from Otto. Alongside Zoox co-founder Jesse Levinson, who narrated the trip like a proud parent, I wound through narrow San Francisco streets in 2018. Scientists at Stanford University, UC Berkeley and Nissan Research Center told me how they are facilitating communication between robot cars and humans.\n\nWednesday\xe2\x80\x99s jaunt in Waymo\xe2\x80\x99s self-driving Jaguar I-Pace had no surprises. The car smoothly glided to a stop at intersections and signaled before turns. The closest thing to a hiccup was a slight jerkiness when it pulled over to drop off us faux ride-hailing passengers. The company confined our 20-minute test drive to the wide, relatively empty streets of the Sunset District, avoiding the hills and traffic elsewhere in the city, so the car didn\xe2\x80\x99t face any challenges. Ever Guardado, our safety driver, never needed to assume control, but did so once at my request just to demonstrate the tones the car sounds when a driver takes over.\n\nFour years ago when I rode in an earlier-generation Waymo robot car at its testing site on a former military base in Merced County, Waymo staged several complex situations: a bicyclist pedaling alongside, a pedestrian wandering into the crosswalk, a car abruptly cutting off the robot car and boxes sprawling into the road. That robot car, which did not have a person behind the wheel, adapted quickly to all the tests thrown at it.\n\nWaymo, an arm of Google parent Alphabet, now has the distinction of running San Francisco\xe2\x80\x99s first robot taxi service for the public, albeit with backup drivers behind the wheel and limits on how many folks it will accept into its testing program.\n\nJessica Christian/The Chronicle\n\nFleets of robot taxis are how Waymo, Cruise, Zoox and other main contenders in the self-driving race hope to eventually recoup their investors\xe2\x80\x99 multibillion-dollar investments.\n\nWhy test robot taxis in San Francisco?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a major ride-hailing market with a lot of demand from residents,\xe2\x80\x9d said spokesperson Julianne McGoldrick. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the toughest environments for driving \xe2\x80\x94 weather, traffic, road grade, cyclists.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn other words, if a robot car can make it here, it can make it anywhere. That\xe2\x80\x99s also the philosophy of several of Waymo\xe2\x80\x99s competitors, notably GM spin-off Cruise, whose white Chevy Bolts are a common sight on city streets.\n\nWaymo is far along on robot taxis in Phoenix, a much easier city to navigate. It\xe2\x80\x99s given rides to selected testers since 2017, jettisoned the backup drivers since 2019 and now, for almost a year, has been giving hundreds of fully autonomous paid rides \xe2\x80\x94 sans backup driver \xe2\x80\x94 every week to any member of the public who summons one via the Waymo One app, which works pretty much like any other ride-hailing app.\n\nEven when there\xe2\x80\x99s no driver in the car, Waymo has operations specialists who monitor the rides via cameras on the dashboard and the back seat. At a ride\xe2\x80\x99s onset, they check that passengers are buckled up and haven\xe2\x80\x99t brought more than three people along. Riders can talk to them by pressing a button on the app or on a console in the back seat.\n\nJessica Christian/The Chronicle\n\nFor now San Francisco rides are free \xe2\x80\x94 Waymo doesn\xe2\x80\x99t yet have permission to charge a fee. And although it\xe2\x80\x99s had permission since 2018 to ditch backup drivers in California, it has not yet done so. Rival Cruise has been testing some cars without backup drivers in San Francisco for nine months.\n\nBut McGoldrick said its trajectory here to fully autonomous paid rides will be quicker than that in Phoenix.\n\nBack in 2016, lots of smart people said fully autonomous cars would be ubiquitous by 2020. AI researchers told me that their then-toddler-aged kids would never get driver\xe2\x80\x99s licenses.\n\nBut the prospect of robot cars \xe2\x80\x94 and the promise that they\xe2\x80\x99ll improve transportation, end traffic fatalities and reduce congestion \xe2\x80\x94 has stayed tantalizingly out of reach.\n\nAir Quality Tracker Check levels down to the neighborhood Ratings for the Bay Area and California, updated every 10 minutes\n\nThe technology got very far along \xe2\x80\x94 but not all the way. The public got disenchanted, especially after an Uber self-driving car struck and killed a pedestrian in 2018. Companies like Uber and Lyft sold off their self-driving units as the industry consolidated.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe low-hanging fruit in this field is some combination of slow speeds, simple environments and semi-supervised operations,\xe2\x80\x9d Bryant Walker Smith, a longtime industry observer and affiliate scholar at the Stanford Law School Center for Internet and Society, said in an email. \xe2\x80\x9cWaymo and Cruise have long been more interested in moon shots.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJessica Christian/The Chronicle\n\nThose companies need to find \xe2\x80\x9csweet spots that are both technically and financially feasible,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, noting that while Phoenix is technically much easier than the Bay Area, it\xe2\x80\x99s also much less lucrative.\n\nCurrent ride-hailing has low expenses, he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAn Uber trip is basically just a poorly paid driver in a midtier car.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut the robot car fleets, even though they eliminated the labor expenses, have to cover costs for cars that mount up to several hundred thousand dollars each, \xe2\x80\x9cas well as a vast infrastructure for remote human monitoring and support.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTV and movies are replete with far-out images of the future. But I was most struck by a low-tech image in the comedy-drama series \xe2\x80\x9cCasual.\xe2\x80\x9d The final season, which aired in 2018, purportedly took place a couple of years in the future.

Oh, and that pedestrian looks as if he might jaywalk in front of you, and that guy in the SUV sure is riding your rear bumper\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nOdds are you\xe2\x80\x99ll do just fine. You\xe2\x80\x99ll make the right adjustments in braking and accelerating, picking just the right moment to go in and out of your lane, all while carrying on a conversation with your passenger.\n\nGenerally, human drivers do relatively well with this kind of complexity. We\xe2\x80\x99re able to respond to the out-of-the-ordinary intuitively.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOn the other hand, we get bored, tired, and easily distracted. Even with all the improvements in automotive safety over the years and depressed vehicle miles traveled from the COVID-19 pandemic, an estimated 38,000 Americans died on the roads in 2020.\n\nAutonomous vehicles have long been promised as the solution, with their sensors that see far ahead in all kinds of weather and their ever-vigilant computers that follow the rules of the road with hyper focus.\n\nBut the reality is more complex. As often happens with new technologies, some challenges are harder than they seemed at first. In fact, the industry is going through a bit of a reset, with companies like Uber and Lyft selling their autonomous vehicle units.\n\nWhy is autonomy hard? The roadways are highly cluttered with many sizes and shapes of obstacles; various objects move in and out quickly and unpredictably; and human behavior is difficult for a machine to predict. Whenever people \xe2\x80\x9cact naturally\xe2\x80\x9d during an odd scenario, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good time to worry about autonomous vehicles.\n\nFor a long time, the answer appeared to be to let an autonomous vehicle do the bulk of the driving, but only with a human behind the wheel, ready to take over in case of failure. The best of both worlds, right?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nUnfortunately, no.\n\nResearch has shown that humans make poor safety drivers. By the time they gain situational awareness in an emergency, it\xe2\x80\x99s often too late to react. In fact, relying upon \xe2\x80\x9chuman fallback\xe2\x80\x9d might actually be more dangerous than fully automated systems.\n\nFurther, the approach of using virtual simulations to prove system safety is facing a harsh reality: The endlessly complex environment, coupled with constantly evolving hardware and software, means that relying upon systems to drive millions of simulated miles, while necessary, is insufficient.\n\nSo, the promise of widely deployed self-driving vehicles remains elusive.\n\nWe still think it\xe2\x80\x99s likely that highly automated vehicles, in some form and performing certain tasks, will become a reality. Where we first see these systems on the roads is uncertain: Maybe electric vehicles \xe2\x80\x94 cheaper to produce than complex gas vehicles \xe2\x80\x94 will include expensive autonomous systems; or maybe autonomous freight trucks on highways may have the right economic incentives for autonomy adoption.\n\nRegardless of which operational model succeeds, we believe there are four major steps we can take in the short term:\n\nLet autonomous vehicles communicate with one another through connected vehicle technology \xe2\x80\x94 The world is a complex place for autonomous vehicles. Weather makes it hard to virtually \xe2\x80\x9csee\xe2\x80\x9d with sensors; emergency responders alter the roadways to make accident scenes safe; and people around the vehicle are hidden by buildings and foliage. Any technology that simplifies this world is crucial to fast and safe adoption of these capabilities. Connected vehicle technology lets these systems \xe2\x80\x9ctalk\xe2\x80\x9d with each other and with the world around them, sharing information about traffic, objects, and intended vehicle paths. To make this vision a reality, industry and the government must come together to implement and standardize these communications, as well as invest in necessary infrastructure.\n\nThe world is a complex place for autonomous vehicles.

"294.txt";"b""Self-driving cars are being developed by several major technology companies and carmakers. credit: VCG/Getty\n\nWhen a driver slams on the brakes to avoid hitting a pedestrian crossing the road illegally, she is making a moral decision that shifts risk from the pedestrian to the people in the car. Self-driving cars might soon have to make such ethical judgments on their own \xe2\x80\x94 but settling on a universal moral code for the vehicles could be a thorny task, suggests a survey of 2.3 million people from around the world.\n\nThe largest ever survey of machine ethics1, published today in Nature, finds that many of the moral principles that guide a driver\xe2\x80\x99s decisions vary by country. For example, in a scenario in which some combination of pedestrians and passengers will die in a collision, people from relatively prosperous countries with strong institutions were less likely to spare a pedestrian who stepped into traffic illegally.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople who think about machine ethics make it sound like you can come up with a perfect set of rules for robots, and what we show here with data is that there are no universal rules,\xe2\x80\x9d says Iyad Rahwan, a computer scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge and a co-author of the study.\n\nThe survey, called the Moral Machine, laid out 13 scenarios in which someone\xe2\x80\x99s death was inevitable. Respondents were asked to choose who to spare in situations that involved a mix of variables: young or old, rich or poor, more people or fewer.\n\nPeople rarely encounter such stark moral dilemmas, and some critics question whether the scenarios posed in the quiz are relevant to the ethical and practical questions surrounding driverless cars. But the study\xe2\x80\x99s authors say that the scenarios stand in for the subtle moral decisions that drivers make every day. They argue that the findings reveal cultural nuances that governments and makers of self-driving cars must take into account if they want the vehicles to gain public acceptance.\n\nAt least one company working on self-driving cars \xe2\x80\x94 the German carmaker Audi \xe2\x80\x94 says that the survey could help prompt an important discussion about these issues. (Other firms with autonomous-vehicle programmes, including auto manufacturer Toyota and technology companies Waymo and Uber, declined to comment on the findings.) And Nicholas Christakis, a social scientist at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, is fascinated by the results.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a remarkable paper,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. The debate about whether ethics are universal or vary between cultures is an old one, says Christakis, and now the \xe2\x80\x9ctwenty-first century problem\xe2\x80\x9d of how to programme self-driving cars has reinvigorated it.\n\nThe road not taken\n\nSome of the world\xe2\x80\x99s biggest tech companies \xe2\x80\x94 including Google's parent, Alphabet; Uber; and Tesla \xe2\x80\x94 and carmakers now have self-driving car programmes. Many of these companies argue that the vehicles could improve road safety, ease traffic and improve fuel efficiency. Social scientists say the cars raise ethical issues, and could have unintended consequences for public safety and the environment.\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nIn 2016, Rahwan\xe2\x80\x99s team stumbled on an ethical paradox about self-driving cars2: in surveys, people said that they wanted an autonomous vehicle to protect pedestrians even if it meant sacrificing its passengers \xe2\x80\x94 but also that they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t buy self-driving vehicles programmed to act this way.\n\nCurious to see if the prospect of self-driving cars might raise other ethical condundrums, Rahwan gathered an international team of psychologists, anthropologists and economists to create the Moral Machine. Within 18 months, the online quiz had recorded 40 million decisions made by people from 233 countries and territories.\n\nNo matter their age, gender or country of residence, most people spared humans over pets, and groups of people over individuals. These responses are in line with rules proposed in what may be the only governmental guidance on self-driving cars: a 2017 report by the German Ethics Commission on Automated and Connected Driving.\n\nBut agreement ends there. When the authors analysed answers from people in the 130 countries with at least 100 respondents, they found that the nations could be divided into three groups. One contains North America and several European nations where Christianity has historically been the dominant religion; another includes countries such as Japan, Indonesia and Pakistan, with strong Confucian or Islamic traditions. A third group consists of Central and South America, as well as France and former French colonies. The first group showed a stronger preference for sacrificing older lives to save younger ones than did the second group, for example.\n\nThe researchers also identified correlations between social and economic factors in a country and the average opinions of its residents. The team found that people from countries with strong government institutions, such as Finland and Japan, more often chose to hit people who were crossing the road illegally than did respondents in nations with weaker institutions, such as Nigeria or Pakistan.\n\nScenarios that forced survey participants to choose whether to save a homeless person on one side of the road or an executive on the other revealed another point of departure: the choices people made often correlated with the level of economic inequality in their culture. People from Finland \xe2\x80\x94 which has a relatively small gap between the rich and the poor \xe2\x80\x94 showed little preference for swerving one way or the other. But the average respondent from Colombia \xe2\x80\x94 a country with significant economic disparity \xe2\x80\x94 chose to kill the lower-status person.\n\nAzim Shariff, a psychologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, finds this result interesting because it suggests that the survey really does reveal people\xe2\x80\x99s moral preferences. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you assume that places that have a lower level of income inequality have political policies that favor egalitarianism, this shows that the moral norms that support those policies are expressed in the way that people play these games.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPotholes ahead?\n\nAlthough autonomous vehicles aren't yet for sale to the public, test versions are cruising through several US cities. By 2021, at least five manufacturers hope to have self-driving cars and trucks in wide use.\n\nBryant Walker Smith, a law professor at the University of South Carolina in Columbia, is sceptical that the Moral Machine survey will have any practical use. He says that the study is unrealistic because there are few instances in real life in which a vehicle would face a choice between striking two different types of people. \xe2\x80\x9cI might as well worry about how automated cars will deal with asteroid strikes,\xe2\x80\x9d Walker Smith says.\n\nBut the study\xe2\x80\x99s authors say that their scenarios represent the minor moral judgements that human drivers make routinely \xe2\x80\x94 which can sometimes be fatal. A driver who veers away from cyclists riding on a curvy mountain road increases her chance of hitting an oncoming vehicle. If the number of driverless cars on the road increases, so too will the likelihood that they will be involved in such accidents.\n\nSome car companies are listening. Barbara Wege, who heads a group focused on autonomous-vehicle ethics at Audi in Ingolstadt, Germany, says such studies are valuable. Wege argues that self-driving cars would cause fewer accidents, proportionally, than human drivers do each year \xe2\x80\x94 but that events involving robots might receive more attention.\n\nSurveys such as the Moral Machine can help to begin public discussions about these inevitable accidents that might foster trust. \xe2\x80\x9cWe need to come up with a social consensus,\xe2\x80\x9d she says, \xe2\x80\x9cabout which risks we are willing to take.\xe2\x80\x9d""";"Autonomous Cars";"294.txt-Autonomous Cars"
"295.txt";"b""B Y THE AGE of seven months, most children have learned that objects still exist even when they are out of sight. Put a toy under a blanket and a child that old will know it is still there, and that he can reach underneath the blanket to get it back. This understanding, of \xe2\x80\x9cobject permanence\xe2\x80\x9d, is a normal developmental milestone, as well as a basic tenet of reality.\n\nListen to this story Your browser does not support the <audio> element. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.\n\nIt is also something that self-driving cars do not have. And that is a problem. Autonomous vehicles are getting better, but they still don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the world in the way that a human being does. For a self-driving car, a bicycle that is momentarily hidden by a passing van is a bicycle that has ceased to exist.\n\nThis failing is basic to the now-widespread computing discipline that has arrogated to itself the slightly misleading moniker of artificial intelligence ( AI ). Current AI works by building up complex statistical models of the world, but it lacks a deeper understanding of reality. How to give AI at least some semblance of that understanding\xe2\x80\x94the reasoning ability of a seven-month-old child, perhaps\xe2\x80\x94is now a matter of active research.\n\nModern AI is based on the idea of machine learning. If an engineer wants a computer to recognise a stop sign, he does not try to write thousands of lines of code that describe every pattern of pixels which could possibly indicate such a sign. Instead, he writes a program that can learn for itself, and then shows that program thousands of pictures of stop signs. Over many repetitions, the program gradually works out what features all of these pictures have in common.\n\nSimilar techniques are used to train self-driving cars to operate in traffic. Cars thus learn how to obey lane markings, avoid other vehicles, hit the brakes at a red light and so on. But they do not understand many things a human driver takes for granted\xe2\x80\x94that other cars on the road have engines and four wheels, or that they obey traffic regulations (usually) and the laws of physics (always). And they do not understand object permanence.\n\nIn a recent paper in Artificial Intelligence, Mehul Bhatt of Orebro University, in Sweden, who is also the founder of a firm called CoDesign Lab which is developing his ideas commercially, describes a different approach. He and his colleagues took some existing AI programs which are used by self-driving cars and bolted onto them a piece of software called a symbolic-reasoning engine.\n\nThe heart has its reasons...\n\nInstead of approaching the world probabilistically, as machine learning does, this software was programmed to apply basic physical concepts to the output of the programs that process signals from an autonomous vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s sensors. This modified output was then fed to the software which drives the vehicle. The concepts involved included the ideas that discrete objects continue to exist over time, that they have spatial relationships with one another\xe2\x80\x94such as \xe2\x80\x9cin-front-of\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbehind\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and that they can be fully or partly visible, or completely hidden by another object.\n\nAnd it worked. In tests, if one car momentarily blocked the sight of another, the reasoning-enhanced software could keep track of the blocked car, predict where and when it would reappear, and take steps to avoid it if necessary. The improvement was not huge. On standard tests Dr Bhatt\xe2\x80\x99s system scored about 5% better than existing software. But it proved the principle. And it also yielded something else. For, unlike a machine-learning algorithm, a reasoning engine can tell you the reason why it did what it did.\n\nYou could, for instance, ask a car fitted with a reasoning engine why it had hit the brakes, and it would be able to tell you that it thought a bicycle hidden by a van was about to enter the intersection ahead. A machine-learning program cannot do that. Besides helping improve program design, such information will, Dr Bhatt reckons, help regulators and insurance companies. It may thus speed up public acceptance of autonomous vehicles.\n\nDr Bhatt\xe2\x80\x99s work is part of a long-standing debate in the field of artificial intelligence. Early AI researchers, working in the 1950s, chalked up some successes using this sort of preprogrammed reasoning. But, beginning in the 1990s, machine learning improved dramatically, thanks to better programming techniques combined with more powerful computers and the availability of more data. Today almost all AI is based on it.\n\nDr Bhatt is not, though, alone in his scepticism. Gary Marcus, who studies psychology and neural science at New York University and is also the boss of an AI and robotics company called Robust. AI , agrees. To support his point of view, Dr Marcus cites a much-publicised result, albeit from eight years ago. This was when engineers at DeepMind (then an independent company, now part of Google) wrote a program that could learn, without being given any hints about the rules, how to play Breakout, a video game which involves hitting a moving virtual ball with a virtual paddle.\n\nDeepMind\xe2\x80\x99s program was a great player. But when another group of researchers tinkered with Breakout\xe2\x80\x99s code\xe2\x80\x94shifting the location of the paddles by just a few pixels\xe2\x80\x94its abilities plummeted. It was not able to generalise what it had learned from a specific situation even to a situation that was only slightly different.\n\nBack to the future\n\nFor Dr Marcus, this example highlights the fragility of machine-learning. But others think it is symbolic reasoning which is brittle, and that machine learning still has a lot of mileage left in it. Among them is Jeff Hawke, vice-president of technology at Wayve, a self-driving-car firm in London. Wayve\xe2\x80\x99s approach is to train the software elements running a car\xe2\x80\x99s various components simultaneously, rather than separately. In demonstrations, Wayve\xe2\x80\x99s cars make good decisions while navigating narrow, heavily trafficked London streets\xe2\x80\x94a task that challenges many humans.\n\nAs Dr Hawke puts it, \xe2\x80\x9cthe complexity of most real-world tasks is greater than is possible to solve with handcrafted rules, and it\xe2\x80\x99s well known that expert systems built with rules tend to struggle with complexity. This is true regardless of how well thought out or structured the formal logic is.\xe2\x80\x9d Such a system might, for instance, craft a rule that a car should stop at a red light. But lights are designed differently in different countries, and some are intended for pedestrians rather than cars. There are also situations in which you might need to jump a red light, such as to make way for a fire engine. \xe2\x80\x9cThe beauty of machine learning\xe2\x80\x9d, Dr Hawke says, \xe2\x80\x9cis that all these factors and concepts can be automatically uncovered and learned from data. And with more data, it continues to learn and become more intelligent.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNicholas Rhinehart, who studies robotics and AI at the University of California, Berkeley, also backs machine learning. He says Dr Bhatt\xe2\x80\x99s approach does indeed show you can combine the two approaches. But he is not sure it is necessary. In his work, and also that of others, machine-learning systems alone can already predict probabilities a few seconds into the future\xe2\x80\x94such as whether another car is likely to give way or not\xe2\x80\x94and make contingency plans based on those predictions.\n\nDr Bhatt responds that you can train a car with data accumulated over millions of kilometres of driving, and still not be sure you have covered all the necessary situations. In many cases, it might be simpler and more effective to program some of the rules in from the start.\n\nFor champions of both strategies, the question goes beyond self-driving cars to the future of AI itself. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think we're taking the right approach right now,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr Marcus says. \xe2\x80\x9c[Machine learning] has proven useful for some things like speech recognition, but it's not actually the answer to AI . We haven\xe2\x80\x99t really solved the intelligence problem.\xe2\x80\x9d One way or another, then, it seems seven-month-olds still have a lot to teach machines. \xe2\x96\xa0\n\nAn early version of this article was published online on September 1st 2021""";"Autonomous Cars";"295.txt-Autonomous Cars"
"296.txt";"b'National Security Implications of Leadership in Autonomous Vehicles\n\nJune 28, 2021\n\nDigital technologies have created a transitional moment for societies. High-speed connectivity, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI) are ubiquitous (even if not always visible) and are reshaping economies by creating new opportunities. This follows a pattern set centuries ago. Automation of basic tasks began in the eighteenth century and accelerated rapidly at the end of the nineteenth century, with a new wave of automation now well underway. Autonomous systems already create value across global markets by lowering costs and improving services. The ability to combine better sensors, more powerful computer processing, and faster connectivity expands the productivity of human labor, creates new services, and automates existing ones.\n\nOne of the most important parts of the next wave of automation is transportation, specifically the appearance of self-driving, or \xe2\x80\x9cautonomous,\xe2\x80\x9d vehicles (AVs). Self-driving cars offer immense gains in productivity and safety. The technologies developed for self-driving cars have broad commercial (and potentially military) implications. A self-driving car is a vehicle capable of navigating without a driver actively operating or monitoring it. Self-driving cars are a kind of specialized robot\xe2\x80\x94not the humanoid robot common to popular culture, but self-operating devices that provide a commercially valuable service and automate routine tasks.\n\nThe impact of autonomous systems on the auto industry will be significant, as the technology behind AVs will reshape transportation and urban life as profoundly as the move from horses to cars. AVs are already a leadingsector for private AI investment, reflecting the market\xe2\x80\x99s estimate of their future importance.\n\nAutomation and the larger digital transformation create major challenges for national security, and the implications of AVs on national security deserve further attention. In addition to new opportunities, widespread deployment of AVs can also create new risks and vulnerabilities, particularly when considered in the context of tech competition between the United States and China.\n\nNational security can be defined as the condition where people can choose how they are governed and live in a world guided by the rule of law. To attain this requires an ability to defend the national interest and, increasingly, an ability to create and use technology in ways that support national security for both the near and long term. Technological leadership used to be seen as important for a few sectors, but its importance has spread across the entire economy. Innovation and the adoption of new technologies are the keys to the long-term growth needed for national security. This is particularly true for automobiles. Cars are now high-tech devices. Vehicles are built around semiconductors and software more than precisely engineered metal parts. The ability to build the cars of the future will be a good indicator of a country\xe2\x80\x99s technological strength and abilities.\n\nThe Military Applications of Autonomous Vehicles\n\nAs much of the innovation and work on AVs is now happening in the private sector, it is reasonable to ask how much carryover there will be from commercial to military uses. In the early stages of developing AV technology, there was considerable overlap. As development progressed, there has been divergence, and the direct application of commercial autonomy will be smaller (the same way a combat aircraft and a passenger aircraft that share certain technologies can jointly benefit from research and development but are ultimately designed for fundamentally different purposes and requirements).\n\nAutonomous devices that operate without human control are deeply attractive to militaries and are already deployed in aerospace and undersea vehicles by leading military powers. Autonomous ground vehicles are more challenging to develop, given the much more complex and varied terrain in which operations take place, but innovation in the commercial self-driving sector could improve military vehicles\xe2\x80\x99 operations. This will be seen first in logistics and support vehicles (e.g., autonomous trucks), where the transition from commercial to military is simpler, and perhaps later in combat vehicles.\n\nIt is not an accident that the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) was the government agency that began work on autonomous driving in 1984 with its Autonomous Land Vehicle program. DARPA then sponsored the earliest AV test in its Grand Challenges, which sought to accelerate the development of AV technologies by holding a race among prototypes for a cash prize. No one completed the first Grand Challenge in 2004. The second iteration, held in a desert area in 2005, was won by a university team which completed the 132-mile course in seven hours. DARPA held a third Grand Challenge two years later in a simulated urban environment, which was also won by another university team. These DARPA efforts, established in response to a 2001 National Defense Authorization Act mandate, jump-started the research into autonomous driving.\n\nBut the current geopolitical contest that threatens U.S. security is not a traditional military competition. It is a new kind of contest that underscores the importance of innovation capabilities and technology leadership. This means that having a strong AV sector, even if not directly applied to military use, is essential for national security. While there may be \xe2\x80\x9cspillover\xe2\x80\x9d effects from technology developed for commercial vehicles for military equipment, the primary contribution will be in strengthening digital industries. That is what will improve national economic performance and help reduce supply chain and espionage concerns. The importance of commercial development has grown. Since the end of the Cold War, advanced technologies have frequently originated in the private sector. The countries that will do best in economics and security will be those that have a strong private-sector tech base from which they can draw upon commercial technological developments.\n\nThe current geopolitical contest that threatens U.S. security is not a traditional military competition. . . . having a strong AV sector, even if not directly applied to military use, is essential for national security.\n\nThe main contribution of AVs to national security, however, does not come from self-driving tanks, but from the importance of the automotive sector to the nation. The automotive industry contributes 3.5 percent of U.S. GDP, making it one of the most important areas of industrial activity (as a comparison, the space and aerospace sector\xe2\x80\x99s share is 4 percent). The development of autonomous and electric vehicles involves the ability to develop and deploy a broad range of important emerging technologies, such as AI, autonomy, and electric propulsion and batteries, and will drive progress in innovation in ways that shape many sectors. Even though the vast majority of the vehicle market is commercial and civilian, when looking at the value of economic strength to national security, AVs are a critical sector for overall national security.\n\nAV Development in the Context of Tech Competition\n\nThe digital transition comes at a moment of significant geopolitical competition. The nature of global competition has changed and is increasingly a battle over technology and economic growth. The national capability to design, build, and innovate in technology will be crucial in this contest.\n\nTechnology creates new kinds of competition and conflict. Leadership in innovation and technology is central to global influence, prestige, and power. AVs are at the cutting edge of technology and are crucial to future U.S. strength. The United States has learned the hard way\xe2\x80\x94in the case of telecom infrastructure manufacturing and Huawei\xe2\x80\x99s extensive deployment and reach\xe2\x80\x94that it is not in the United States\xe2\x80\x99 interest to lose a strategic industry or to find itself dependent on an adversarial foreign power for key technologies. While there is minimal risk that the dynamic automotive sector in the United States would disappear like Nortel or Lucent, keeping this sector strong is essential for the national interest and national security. Automobiles are not an industry the United States can afford to lose any more than it would want to lose its aerospace industry.\n\nDeploying fully autonomous cars is an immense technological challenge, requiring advances in computing, sensors, and networking. The first step has been the deployment of assisted driving systems, which are now relatively common in newer cars. Full autonomy is several levels beyond this and in various stages of testing by several companies. This involves further advances in sensors and processing. The work to meet these challenges will deepen the U.S. technological base and, by commercializing research, strengthen it. Companies will also need a supportive regulatory environment to be able to deploy AVs at commercial scale. For the United States, a strong technology base and supportive regulatory environment is crucial for national security and for maintaining its global influence and economic strength.\n\nThe ability to apply new technologies to commercial and security matters is as important as the ability to create them. Nations that have the companies and skills to develop AI and apply it to economic activities will be stronger and more secure. It is not surprising then that more and more countries are developing their own AI strategies, highlighting their importance for growth and safety. Sixty countries have already collectively issued over 600 AI policy initiatives, including governance efforts and financial support for the sector. These policies will also help make the implementers more influential in the global arena, where global perceptions of tech leadership and economic performance provide substantial political benefit. This has been a core part of the United States\xe2\x80\x99 international strength since landing on the moon in the late 1960s and is one reason why the competition with China creates such serious concerns.\n\nFor the United States, a strong technology base and supportive regulatory environment is crucial for national security and for maintaining its global influence and economic strength.\n\nAdopting new technologies is the best path to creating wealth for countries such as the United States and the best way to increase productivity (which has been a problem for the United States and others, including China). AVs\xe2\x80\x99 most important contribution to national security may come from increasing the United States\xe2\x80\x99 productivity and wealth as part of the larger AI and robotics revolution.\n\nThe United States and China\n\nThere is a clear competition between the United States and China, and a major part of this competition is over leadership in technology. Both sides recognize the economic and security returns of technological leadership, and China has sought technological independence from the West for more than a century. The longer-term contest between the two is over how the world will be structured, and technological leadership is increasingly a determinant of national power.\n\nChina has a very different view of how societies should be governed, how international relations should be structured, and what its place should be among great powers. China is making a concerted and public effort to obtain superiority and to dominate key markets. The MIC2025 plan exemplifies the focus and importance of the technology sector. There are long-standing plans in China (albeit with mixed results) for a massive expansion of its technological capability. There is now a growing realization in the United States that it needs to respond to this, embodied in proposed legislation such as the Endless Frontier Act.\n\nThe desire in China to develop indigenous technological capabilities equivalent to the West dates back to the nineteenth century when European industrialization and its consequences displaced China from what it sees as its rightful place. China\xe2\x80\x99s lack of advanced technologies allowed troubling European interventions in China\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign affairs and began what the Chinese refer to as the \xe2\x80\x9cCentury of Humiliation,\xe2\x80\x9d where the once-great power lost sovereign control to imperialist states in Europe. Almost two centuries later, after surpassing Europe economically, China believes it has reached a moment when it can return to the center of global power. The obstacle to this return is the United States.\n\nThere are many questions about this Chinese narrative of resurgence under the Chinese Communist Party\xe2\x80\x99s (CCP) rule, but it meets compelling domestic political needs. The CCP\xe2\x80\x99s claim to unchallenged rule is buttressed by powerful nationalist sentiments, long present in China as a reaction to the West and now exploited by the CCP. China\xe2\x80\x99s president Xi Jinping has been clear in his views that the West is in decline and that a new world order should be centered on China. China\xe2\x80\x99s rise has been propelled by a number of factors, including heavy state investment in technology, but also by illicit measures, including a disregard for its World Trade Organization (WTO) commitments on the treatment of foreign companies, intellectual property (IP) theft, and a massive industrial espionage campaign targeting Western technology. China feels justified in these actions because of the Century of Humiliation and an artificial narrative about how the United States also relies on similar measures.\n\nChina\xe2\x80\x99s goals are to ensure that its economic development and modernization continues, to end reliance on foreign technologies, and to build a technology base strong enough to produce high-tech weaponry and commercial products that, when combined with subsidies, can displace foreign competitors. China uses a hybrid state/market model. \xe2\x80\x9cMilitary-Civil Fusion\xe2\x80\x9d moves China\xe2\x80\x99s economy much closer to a wartime footing, with a deep integration of the civilian and defense technological systems. Except in a few key areas, China\xe2\x80\x99s innovation system remains weaker than that of the United States. Self-driving cars, however, are an area where there are several competitive Chinese firms and Chinese technology is strong. China\xe2\x80\x99s government seeks to replace the United States in technological leadership and utilize technologies such as AVs to boost its military and economic competitiveness.\n\nThe 2021 annual threat assessment by the U.S. intelligence community addressed the risks to the United States\xe2\x80\x99 national security from emerging technologies. The report concludes that China will maintain its policies to promote indigenous technological innovation, since Chinese leaders perceive these policies as the way to \xe2\x80\x9creduce the dependence on foreign technologies, enable military advances, and sustain economic growth and thus ensure the CCP\xe2\x80\x99s survival.\xe2\x80\x9d AVs and self-driving cars are part of this larger competition between the United States and China. They are also central to the competition over the development and use of AI. In all countries, this AI competition involves a blend of government funding and private actors driven in part or entirely by market incentives and government subsidies.\n\nChina already has a robust AV industry aimed at the commercial market. In early 2017, Qiushi (the official journal of the CCP) identified innovative military technologies, such as unmanned tanks and remote-controlled shop trucks, as a unique opportunity for China to exceed the United States in military power.\n\nBoth China and the United States have advantages and disadvantages in a contest that revolves around technology, research, and investment. The United States benefits from a robust entrepreneurial environment, a dynamic and risk-taking financial system, a strong research base, and an innovation community skilled at commercializing research. China also has an entrepreneurial private sector and a growing research sector, but the government\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to invest large amounts over many years in its technological base is its primary advantage over the United States.\n\nChinese behaviors have eroded the commercial and technological globalization of the last three decades and, more importantly, pose a real national security risk to the United States. A world where China sets the rules will find that the rules are used to meet the needs of the CCP. Privacy is nonexistent in China and will be nonexistent in a world China leads. China will use its political power to confer commercial advantage on its companies at the expense of foreign competitors. This sounds harsh, but it is a description of the CCP, not of China itself.\n\nToday, China has the world\xe2\x80\x99s second-largest economy, supported by state-directed investment, is conducting aggressive industrial espionage programs globally over the internet, and is exhibiting a continued unwillingness to observe trade obligations. Using a Chinese AV, with all its internet connections, could be as risky as using Chinese telecoms.\n\nAutonomous Vehicles Will Create New Cybersecurity Risks and Vulnerabilities\n\nCybercrime is a lucrative activity. It cost the global economy more than a trillion dollars in 2019, and the rate of increase in costs has accelerated since 2010. Cybercrime harms public safety, undermines national security, and damages economies. Ransomware, phishing schemes, and cryptocurrencies make it easier to succeed and monetize cybercrime and, when combined with the sanctuary offered by big countries, help explain the rapid increase. AVs, given their reliance on software, computing, and connectivity, could be a new vector for cybersecurity risks.\n\nCars have become rolling computers, loaded with cameras, microphones, and other sensors, all operated by complex software. Increasingly, modern cars connect to the internet and collect information on location, speed, and perhaps on driver communications (e.g., text, email, voice). This means that data from cars can be accessed remotely, with the owner\xe2\x80\x99s permission or perhaps without it. Manufacturers already use this information for safety, convenience, predictive maintenance, and increasingly for entertainment. Future cars will collect even more data.\n\nSome of that data can reference locations and geographical features. Cross-border data transmission can be problematic if sensitive information is being collected. A 2017 paper from the Chinese Academy of Telecommunication Research of China\xe2\x80\x99s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology addresses that collection of information and considers it a matter of national security if foreign cars are used in China.\n\nAnything that is connected to the internet is vulnerable. The hardware and software behind AVs create a range of opportunities to hackers, as does the need to integrate hardware and software. Many different systems interact in a self-driving car and provide opportunities for hacking to manipulate different systems, including navigation, entertainment, or connectivity with other cars and infrastructure. Given their reliance on continuous communication, another concern is external manipulation of AV systems. From manipulating indicators or attacking the camera system to read speed signs incorrectly, to tampering with road paint to misguide the vehicle, AVs contribute to a vulnerable threat environment.\n\nIn-vehicle and inter-vehicle communication systems are necessary for the safe operation of AVs. In similar ways to the vulnerabilities created by the Internet of Things (IoT), the \xe2\x80\x9cInternet of Vehicles\xe2\x80\x9d (IoV) creates new challenges for cybersecurity. Cars have become another device at the edge of the network where connectivity tempts attackers. Vehicles require not only that their systems be able to communicate with each other, but also connect with other AVs or infrastructure relying on a wireless network.\n\nAnything that is connected to the internet is vulnerable. The hardware and software behind AVs create a range of opportunities to hackers, as does the need to integrate hardware and software.\n\nSupply chains can be compromised from the start. If AVs come from an untrustworthy source or if there are supply chain risks, even the best cybersecurity will not have an impact in risk reduction. A vehicle could be 100 percent unhackable, but if the manufacturer has built-in access and collection or if the information collected by the vehicle is sent over the internet to a hostile country, it will circumvent any defense. There is no need for a back door when the manufacturer has the key to the front door.\n\nRecent events highlight the potential for cybersecurity risks with AVs. Ransomware attacks, where an individual car or a class of cars could be rendered inoperable until a ransom is paid, are possible. While these could be aimed at individual car owners, it is more likely that cybercriminals will go after fleet operations or car manufacturers as better-paying possibilities. While a strong domestic AV industry will not eliminate cybersecurity risk, it would be much more preferable than a supply and car industry located in a hostile competitor.\n\nEspionage and Autonomous Vehicles\n\nThe concerns regarding cybersecurity and data protection are not only important for user protection, but also in the context of national security and geopolitical competition with China. The trove of data collected by AVs, paired with cybersecurity vulnerabilities, creates an appealing target for intelligence collection. AVs will require thinking of cars in a new way when it comes to espionage risk.\n\nIt is unlikely that the governments of other major car producers\xe2\x80\x94Germany, Japan, and Korea\xe2\x80\x94will exploit this advantage. They have no political or security motive to do so. China is another matter, however. A 2020 survey of Chinese espionage by CSIS found 152 publicly reported instances of Chinese espionage directed at the United States since 2000. This did not include espionage against U.S. firms or persons located in China, nor did it include the more than 1,200 IP theft cases brought by U.S. companies against Chinese entities. U.S. officials have repeatedly stated that China\xe2\x80\x99s espionage efforts exceed in scope and scale what was seen in the Cold War. This is because global digital networks and technologies provide China with immense new opportunities for espionage.\n\nIn China, the 2017 National Intelligence Law permits the Chinese government to demand and receive information from Chinese companies and citizens. Article 14 reads that \xe2\x80\x9cstate intelligence work organs, when legally carrying forth intelligence work, may demand that concerned organs, organizations, or citizens provide needed support, assistance, and cooperation.\xe2\x80\x9d Legally carrying forth intelligence work means any action authorized by the CPP leadership, which keeps close control over China\xe2\x80\x99s intelligence agencies and activities.\n\nThis means that data on location, behavior, and potentially conversations from the operators of Chinese-made cars could be accessed by the government over the internet. China is the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest surveillance state, and Chinese network technologies provide the Chinese government with the tools for monitoring behavior and collecting information on residents in its territory\xe2\x80\x94early examples include \xe2\x80\x9cGolden Shield\xe2\x80\x9d (a massive communications surveillance program) and \xe2\x80\x9cGreen Dam\xe2\x80\x9d (a monitoring and censorship program required on laptops in China). China may have tipped its hand about intent when it banned Tesla vehicles from driving into military facilities and housing compounds for personnel working in sensitive industries and state agencies. (Tesla has attempted to placate the Chinese by promising to hold all Chinese data in China.) The features that allow the collection and exfiltration of data potentially make cars an ideal surveillance platform.\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nIf this contest did not involve an unscrupulous and adversarial foreign power, it would be a normal commercial competition among companies, governed by the rules that apply to trade and the protection of IP. Commercial competition shapes U.S., European, Korean, and Japanese auto companies, but the same is not always true for China, where the government can play a much more directive role. That difference is what makes the contest over AVs so important.\n\nThere is a strong research base in Europe, and a long heritage of skilled engineering, but they have had difficulty commercializing the results of research. This may be less of a handicap in self-driving cars, given the strength and central position of the German auto industry, as long as Europe has access to leading-edge AI research and microelectronics from European and non-European sources. The contest takes place in a complicated international political environment. The chief complication is with Europe. Simply put, Berlin is a major driver of European policy, and it is currently unwilling to push hard on China because it is an essential market for Germany\xe2\x80\x99s car industry\xe2\x80\x94even though the Germans fear that China\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate intent is to ransack their automotive technology and displace German carmakers. This could damage a major U.S. security and economic partner in ways that harm both its interests and those of the United States. Trends in European politics suggest this more relaxed approach to China may be changing as suspicions about China\xe2\x80\x99s economic and political power grow.\n\nThe United States has also begun to address the decades-long shortfall in public investment on research and technology. The United States is unused to being challenged and was not prepared for this challenge from China. It has relied on technology to provide a qualitative advantage over opponents since World War II, but the requirements for technological advantage have changed. In the past, technological superiority was produced by a superb scientific establishment, long-term federal support for research, and close links between the research and industrial communities. Both support and linkages atrophied in the last few decades. More importantly, technological innovation is now led by the private sector and oriented toward commercial markets. This is where qualitative advantage for national security will come from in the future.\n\nTechnological progress is cumulative and continuous, and the pace at which nations adopt new technologies will help to determine their security relative to others. The nation that \xe2\x80\x9cdominates\xe2\x80\x9d AI (to quote Russian president Vladimir Putin) will not be \xe2\x80\x9cthe ruler of the world,\xe2\x80\x9d but the nation that is best at creating and accommodating technological change will do better in economics and security than others. The ability to employ AI and autonomous systems to gain better performance, new digital services, and create wealth is at the core of the new international competition and an area where the United States must ensure that its policies and regulations keep it competitive. No nation will \xe2\x80\x9cdominate\xe2\x80\x9d AI or the AV market, but being a leader in autonomy is a vital U.S. interest and crucial for national security.\n\nJames Andrew Lewis is a senior vice president and director of the Strategic Technologies Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, D.C.\n\nThis report is made possible by support from Cruise LLC.\n\nThis report is produced by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a private, tax-exempt institution focusing on international public policy issues.

Maybe take a nap or play a game on the in-car entertainment screen. Regardless, you will not need to watch the road. The car will get you there and back safely.\n\nAre we there yet? If not, when will we be?\n\nAutomation and autonomous driving are complex subjects. What engineers can safely deliver doesn\xe2\x80\x99t always match what marketers want to sell.\n\nThis guide will walk you through what you need to know about automotive autopilot, self-driving technology, and driver aids today and tomorrow.\n\nWhat is a Self-Driving Car?\n\nWhen discussing automotive assistance systems\xe2\x80\x99 terminology, no one agrees on what to call anything in this field. From engineering jargon to marketing speak, the lingo continues to evolve.\n\nRoughly speaking, you can sort the technologies people might refer to as self-driving into two categories \xe2\x80\x94 driver support and automation systems. Read on to see how they differ.\n\nDriver Support\n\nDriver support technology reduces the workload on the driver. Today, most automakers sell various driver support systems, either as standard equipment or as options on their cars. These include intelligent or adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assists, and hands-free capability.\n\nAutonomous Systems\n\nAutonomous systems do the driving for you. No automaker today sells a true autonomous system, but some are pushing toward that technology. One such project underway is Waymo, a sister company to Google, that is testing autonomous rideshare vehicles in Phoenix using converted Chrysler Pacifica minivans.\n\nRELATED STORIES: Report: Apple Self-Driving Car Coming by 2024\n\nSix Levels of Self-Driving Technology\n\nSAE International, a global association of engineers and related technical experts in the aerospace, automotive, and commercial-vehicle industries, has laid out a useful framework for thinking about self-driving systems. They sort the technologies into six levels, labeled zero through five (okay, even automotive engineers don\xe2\x80\x99t always do the logical thing).\n\nHowever, not every level is classified as autonomous driving. According to SAE, levels zero through two are considered driver support features, while levels three through five are classified as having autonomous capability.\n\nLevel 0\n\nAt Level 0, the car reacts only to the driver\xe2\x80\x99s input. Even if it uses sensors to warn you of surrounding traffic, like a blind-spot alert system or a lane-departure warning, it still has no self-driving capability to correct or counter the perceived threat.\n\nLevel 1\n\nAt Level 1, your car can intervene slightly in your driving in an attempt to keep you safe. A lane-keeping system that helps steer to center you in a lane is a Level 1 technology.\n\nRELATED STORIES: What is Adaptive Cruise Control?\n\nLevel 2\n\nAt Level 2, features communicate with one another, and more than one can be active simultaneously. An example of this autonomous technology is an adaptive cruise control system that adjusts your speed to keep you a certain distance from the car ahead while centering the car in its lane.\n\nCurrently, Level 2 systems are the most sophisticated technology sold on cars in America. Some automakers describe these systems in ways that make them seem more advanced than Level 2 standards because they allow drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel briefly. However, all these systems require drivers to keep their eyes focused ahead. Drivers need to be ready at all times to take over control of the car at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice.\n\nLevel 3\n\nAt Level 3, the car can drive itself under limited conditions, but the driver must remain aware and prepared to take over. Automakers have tested Level 3 systems that will allow the driver to take their hands off the wheel in a traffic jam, for instance, but prompt the driver to take over when the congestion eases.\n\nAccording to Honda and a few other reputable sites, the Honda 100 Legend Flagship car is the first Level 3 autonomous car. Right now, it\xe2\x80\x99s only available in Japan for leasing. It was released on March 5, 2021.\n\nThere are no Level 3 systems currently sold to consumers in the U.S.\n\nLevel 4\n\nAt Level 4, the car can drive itself in a fixed loop on known roads. The rider is not required to take over driving at any time. These vehicles may or may not have a steering wheel or pedals. In some places, Level 4 driverless rideshare vehicles (like Waymo\xe2\x80\x99s) are in limited testing. But they are not yet approved for general use in any state.\n\nLevel 5\n\nAt Level 5, the car can drive itself under any conditions and on any road. These vehicles do not have steering wheels or pedals. At this point, Level 5 systems are theoretical.\n\nCan You Trust It?\n\nAll self-driving systems currently for sale in the United States are SAE Level 2 or lower. It is not safe to remove your attention from driving while behind the wheel of any car currently sold with this technology. However, it is safe to briefly remove your hands from the wheel with some Level 2 systems under certain conditions. But you should remain prepared to take over the driving at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice.\n\nTesla advertises its automation systems more aggressively than any other U.S. automaker. Still, its advertising materials flatly state, \xe2\x80\x9cAutopilot and Full Self-Driving Capability are intended for use with a fully attentive driver, who has their hands on the wheel and is prepared to take over at any moment. While these features are designed to become more capable over time, the currently enabled features do not make the vehicle autonomous.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDo You Still Need to Pay Attention to the Road?\n\nYes. Always. Even when using driving assist technology in Levels 0 to 3, it\xe2\x80\x99s required that you always keep your eyes on the road.\n\nHowever, when using low-speed applications, including self-parking features, keeping your eyes on the road or staying inside the vehicle may not be needed. For example, some luxury brands offer a self-parking remote that handles this maneuver for things like parallel parking.\n\nWhich Cars Have Self-Driving Capability?\n\nVirtually every automaker selling cars in the U.S. today offers driver-assistance systems that can reduce the workload on the driver. These include adaptive cruise control that can adjust speed to maintain distance from the car ahead or automatic emergency braking that can slow or stop the car to avoid hitting a vehicle or pedestrian or reduce the severity of a crash.\n\nNone of these systems are so reliable that the driver can take their attention from the task of driving, though.\n\nMany manufacturers currently market systems up to and including Level 2 automation. This approach combines adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assist into a system that requires that the driver keep their hands on the wheel but relieves some of the driver\xe2\x80\x99s workload.\n\nA prime example is cruise control with stop-and-go capability that allows the driver to negotiate heavy traffic without using the pedals.\n\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s a breakdown of what to expect from several of them.\n\nNissan ProPILOT\n\nNissan markets this as ProPILOT, \xe2\x80\x9ca hands-on driver-assist system that combines Nissan\xe2\x80\x99s Intelligent Cruise Control and Steering Assist technologies and includes a stop and hold function that can bring the vehicle to a full stop, hold in place, and can bring you back up to speed when traffic starts moving again.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNewer versions use the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s navigation system information to slow for curves ahead and prompt the driver to adjust for posted speed limits. While it will keep the car centered in its lane, it will not steer the car through curves like Kia\xe2\x80\x99s, Ford\xe2\x80\x99s, GM\xe2\x80\x99s, or Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s systems.\n\nSubaru EyeSight\n\nSubaru\xe2\x80\x99s EyeSight system does much the same. It also has a pre-collision braking system that alerts the driver to an impending crash and applies full braking power to try to prevent it.\n\nVolvo Pilot Assist\n\nVolvo\xe2\x80\x99s Pilot Assist allows the driver to set a preferred speed and preferred distance from the vehicle ahead. It can then change speed to maintain that distance and keep the car centered in its lane. But Pilot Assist will warn the driver audibly and shut itself off if the road starts to curve or if it detects that the driver has removed their hands from the wheel.\n\nMercedes-Benz Distronic Plus with Steering Assist\n\nMercedes-Benz\xe2\x80\x99s Distronic Plus with Steering Assist also combines adaptive cruise control with a lane-centering system. In keeping with Mercedes\xe2\x80\x99 autobahn image, it functions at up to 120 mph and warns drivers if they are about to be passed.\n\nAnother feature, called Parktronic, allows drivers to follow the car\xe2\x80\x99s commands under 20 mph as it self-parks the vehicle. The driver keeps control of the car with the gas and brake pedals. The driver just needs to put the car in drive or reverse as it drives and steers itself into a parking space.\n\nTesla Autopilot and Full Self-Driving\n\nTesla markets its evolving suite of self-driving technologies more aggressively than any other automaker. This has led to some confusion as to what level of automation Tesla cars are currently capable of. The electric car company sells the systems under two names: Autopilot, and Full Self-Driving.\n\nEvery Tesla vehicle available in 2021 ships with the company\xe2\x80\x99s Autopilot system enabled. Autopilot is a traffic-aware cruise control system that accelerates and slows the car to match the speed of the cars around it, combined with a lane-keeping assist system that centers the car in a clearly marked lane. That\xe2\x80\x99s all it is. The marketing name \xe2\x80\x9cAutopilot\xe2\x80\x9d may make it sound considerably more advanced. But it is similar to adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assist systems offered by most automakers, like Nissan\xe2\x80\x99s ProPILOT or Subaru\xe2\x80\x99s EyeSight.\n\nOlder Teslas use torque sensors in the steering wheel to monitor the driver\xe2\x80\x99s attention level and promptly alert them if their attention seems to be waning. Newer models use a more accurate camera for the same purpose.\n\nFull Self-Driving\n\nTesla\xe2\x80\x99s Full Self-Driving is considerably more sophisticated. Despite its name, it does not possess SAE Level 5 self-driving capability. Full Self-Driving can park the car in a parking space, back it out of a parking space, and change lanes on its own at highway speeds. A more advanced system in beta testing can slow the car for stop signs and traffic lights and navigate highway on-ramps and off-ramps. Tesla regularly sends updates to this system remotely to cars currently involved in the beta test.\n\nCrucially, Full Self-Driving does not allow the driver to take their attention from the road. They may temporarily take their hands from the wheel but should be prepared to take over driving at any moment. Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s own marketing materials caution, \xe2\x80\x9cThe currently enabled Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFull Self-Driving is a costly option, even by luxury car standards. As of this writing, the Tesla self-driving price for the feature adds $10,000 to the total cost. Tesla promises to update it regularly in hopes of eventually releasing an SAE Level 5 autonomous driving system to everyone who has purchased Full Self-Driving.\n\nHowever, in a recent letter to California state regulators, Tesla said that Full Self-Driving would remain at Level 2. The company said it did \xe2\x80\x9cnot expect significant enhancements\xe2\x80\x9d that would \xe2\x80\x9cshift the responsibility for the entire dynamic driving task to the system.\xe2\x80\x9d Instead, the letter said, Full Self-Driving \xe2\x80\x9cwill continue to be an SAE Level 2, advanced driver assistance feature.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nConsumers should be aware that the company has told shoppers it will someday have Level 5 capability and has told government regulators that it would not.\n\nCheck out our YouTube videos on the Tesla Model Y and Tesla Model S\n\nGeneral Motors Super Cruise\n\nGeneral Motors offers its own advanced driver assistance system, an SAE Level 2 system called Super Cruise. Like Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s Autopilot, Super Cruise includes an adaptive cruise control that will speed up and slow down the vehicle to maintain a driver-selected distance from the vehicle ahead. It also has a lane-keeping system that tries to center the car in its lane even through curves in the road, and automatic emergency braking that brakes the car in an attempt to avert a collision.\n\nSuper Cruise requires the driver to stay alert and keep their hands near the wheel. It includes a driver monitoring system that watches the driver\xe2\x80\x99s eyes and warns them if their attention seems to be drifting from the road. GM says, \xe2\x80\x9cSuper Cruise allows the driver to drive hands-free when compatible road driving conditions allow the feature to be available. But the driver still needs to pay close attention to the road. Even while using the Super Cruise driver assistance technology, drivers should always pay attention while driving and not use a hand-held device.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSuper Cruise is currently available on most Cadillac vehicles and the Chevy Bolt and Bolt EUV electric vehicles. GM plans to extend it to parts of the Buick and GMC lineup in 2022. Super Cruise is free for the first three years but requires a subscription after that.\n\nOf note, Super Cruise works only on roads mapped by GM. The company mapped at least 200,000 miles of roads in the U.S. and Canada using lidar mapping technology.\n\nFord Blue Cruise\n\nFord and its Lincoln luxury division recently introduced their own Level 2 automation system, called Blue Cruise. Buyers can order Blue Cruise on many new Ford and Lincoln vehicles today. But the system isn\xe2\x80\x99t active yet. Ford expects to activate it late in 2021 through an over-the-air software update that will not require a visit to the dealership.\n\nLike Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s Autopilot and GM\xe2\x80\x99s Super Cruise systems, Blue Cruise pairs an adaptive cruise control with lane-keeping assistance. It allows drivers to temporarily remove their hands from the wheel while keeping their eyes on the road.\n\nBlue Cruise automatically steers the vehicle using more than 100,000 miles of pre-mapped roads stored in the system. In Blue Cruise-equipped cars, the driver\xe2\x80\x99s instrument cluster switches to a blue background when driving on a road where the system can be activated.\n\nA subscription to Blue Cruise costs $600 for three years. However, to use it, you must buy an option package that has all the necessary equipment. The cost range is $995 to $2,600, depending on the model.\n\nTraffic Jam Assists\n\nLuxury automakers have begun developing semi-autonomous driving systems specifically for use in heavy traffic. They allow the driver to relax their attention and let the car accelerate and brake to keep its place in traffic, but systems work only at lower speeds.\n\nBMW\xe2\x80\x99s Active Driving Assistant Pro, for instance, shuts off when traffic exceeds 40 mph. It will not steer the vehicle through curves.\n\nAudi is developing its own Traffic Jam Pilot that, it says, should allow drivers to remove their hands from the wheel below 37 mph. But that system has not received regulatory approval.\n\nThe Future of Self-Driving Cars\n\nEngineers from more than a dozen companies are testing self-driving systems in hopes of producing an SAE Level 5 self-driving car. It seems safe to predict that the technology is coming.\n\nBut the engineering challenge of getting there is immense. A car that can drive itself on well-maintained roads may make a critical mistake on poorly maintained roads. What if a car that can react safely to normal traffic may not react safely to unusual situations? A car that can do everything engineers ask of it may fail when presented with a problem they never considered (in one recent incident, a self-driving car in testing was baffled by a truck bed full of traffic signs being delivered to a construction site. The car had no idea what to do).\n\nBeyond the engineering challenge, 50 sets of state laws (plus the District of Columbia) must adapt to decide safety and liability issues before self-driving cars can become common.\n\nThe market will also have its say. Volkswagen recently unveiled a concept car that would charge by the mile for self-driving capability. Executives reasoned that as long as getting your car to drive you somewhere costs less than a train ticket to that same place, they could charge for using the self-driving feature. So, while some automakers hope to charge buyers upfront for automation, others may make it available for short-term rental only.\n\nLastly, there\xe2\x80\x99s the matter of marketing. It\xe2\x80\x99s already growing difficult to sort what manufacturers claim their cars can do from what they can actually do. That will only grow cloudier as the technology advances.\n\nSo, while you may be able to own a self-driving car in your lifetime, it may be further away than advancing technology would indicate.\n\nMore: Best Cars and Top 10 Lists\n\nRelated Self-Driving Stories:'";"Autonomous Cars";"3.txt-Autonomous Cars"
"301.txt";"b'Road vehicle that is capable of moving safely with little or no human input\n\nFor broader coverage of this topic, see Vehicular automation\n\nA self-driving car, also known as an autonomous vehicle (AV or auto), driverless car, or robo-car (robotic car),[1][2][3] is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and moving safely with little or no human input.[4][5]\n\nSelf-driving cars combine a variety of sensors to perceive their surroundings, such as radar, lidar, sonar, GPS, odometry and inertial measurement units.[1][4] Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage.[4][6][7][8]\n\nPossible implementations of the technology include personal self-driving vehicles, shared robotaxis, connected vehicle platoons and long-distance trucking.[4] Several projects to develop a fully self-driving commercial car are in various stages of development. Waymo became the first service provider to offer robotaxi rides to the general public in a part of Phoenix, Arizona in 2020, while Tesla has said it will offer subscription-based ""full self-driving"" to private vehicle owners in 2021,[9][10] and Nuro has been allowed to start autonomous commercial delivery operations in California in 2021.[11] In China two publicly accessible trials of robo-taxis have been launched, in 2020 in Shenzhen\'s Pingshan District by Chinese firm AutoX[12] and in 2021 at Shougang Park in Beijing by Baidu, a venue for the 2022 Winter Olympics.[13]\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nExperiments have been conducted on automated driving systems (ADS) since at least the 1920s;[14] trials began in the 1950s. The first semi-automated car was developed in 1977, by Japan\'s Tsukuba Mechanical Engineering Laboratory, which required specially marked streets that were interpreted by two cameras on the vehicle and an analog computer. The vehicle reached speeds up to 30 kilometres per hour (19 mph) with the support of an elevated rail.[15][16]\n\nA landmark autonomous car appeared in the 1980s, with Carnegie Mellon University\'s Navlab[17] and ALV[18][19] projects funded by the United States\' Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) starting in 1984 and Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich\'s EUREKA Prometheus Project in 1987.[20] By 1985, the ALV had demonstrated self-driving speeds on two-lane roads of 31 kilometres per hour (19 mph), with obstacle avoidance added in 1986, and off-road driving in day and nighttime conditions by 1987.[21] A major milestone was achieved in 1995, with CMU\'s NavLab 5 completing the first autonomous coast-to-coast drive of the United States. Of the 2,849 mi (4,585 km) between Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and San Diego, California, 2,797 mi (4,501 km) were autonomous (98.2%), completed with an average speed of 63.8 mph (102.7 km/h).[22][23][24][25] From the 1960s through the second DARPA Grand Challenge in 2005, automated vehicle research in the United States was primarily funded by DARPA, the US Army, and the US Navy, yielding incremental advances in speeds, driving competence in more complex conditions, controls, and sensor systems.[26] Companies and research organizations have developed prototypes.[20][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34]\n\nThe US allocated US$650 million in 1991 for research on the National Automated Highway System, which demonstrated automated driving through a combination of automation embedded in the highway with automated technology in vehicles, and cooperative networking between the vehicles and with the highway infrastructure. The program concluded with a successful demonstration in 1997 but without clear direction or funding to implement the system on a larger scale.[35] Partly funded by the National Automated Highway System and DARPA, the Carnegie Mellon University Navlab drove 4,584 kilometres (2,848 mi) across America in 1995, 4,501 kilometres (2,797 mi) or 98% of it autonomously.[36] Navlab\'s record achievement stood unmatched for two decades until 2015, when Delphi improved it by piloting an Audi, augmented with Delphi technology, over 5,472 kilometres (3,400 mi) through 15 states while remaining in self-driving mode 99% of the time.[37] In 2015, the US states of Nevada, Florida, California, Virginia, and Michigan, together with Washington, DC, allowed the testing of automated cars on public roads.[38]\n\nFrom 2016 to 2018, the European Commission funded an innovation strategy development for connected and automated driving through the Coordination Actions CARTRE and SCOUT.[39] Moreover, the Strategic Transport Research and Innovation Agenda (STRIA) Roadmap for Connected and Automated Transport was published in 2019.[40]\n\nIn November 2017, Waymo announced that it had begun testing driverless cars without a safety driver in the driver position;[41] however, there was still an employee in the car.[42] An October 2017 report by the Brookings Institute found that the $80 billion had been reported as invested in all facets of self driving technology up to that point, but that it was ""reasonable to presume that total global investment in autonomous vehicle technology is significantly more than this.""[43]\n\nIn October 2018, Waymo announced that its test vehicles had traveled in automated mode for over 10,000,000 miles (16,000,000 km), increasing by about 1,000,000 miles (1,600,000 kilometres) per month.[44] In December 2018, Waymo was the first to commercialize a fully autonomous taxi service in the US, in Phoenix, Arizona.[45] In October 2020, Waymo launched a geo-fenced driverless ride hailing service in Phoenix.[46][47] The cars are being monitored in real-time by a team of remote engineers, and there are cases where the remote engineers need to intervene.[48][47]\n\nIn March 2019, ahead of the autonomous racing series Roborace, Robocar set the Guinness World Record for being the fastest autonomous car in the world. In pushing the limits of self-driving vehicles, Robocar reached 282.42 km/h (175.49 mph) \xe2\x80\x93 an average confirmed by the UK Timing Association at Elvington in Yorkshire, UK.[49]\n\nIn 2020, a National Transportation Safety Board chairman stated that no self-driving cars (SAE level 3+) were available for consumers to purchase in the US in 2020:\n\nThere is not a vehicle currently available to US consumers that is self-driving. Period. Every vehicle sold to US consumers still requires the driver to be actively engaged in the driving task, even when advanced driver assistance systems are activated. If you are selling a car with an advanced driver assistance system, you\xe2\x80\x99re not selling a self-driving car. If you are driving a car with an advanced driver assistance system, you don\xe2\x80\x99t own a self-driving car.[50]\n\nOn 5 March 2021, Honda began leasing in Japan a limited edition of 100 Legend Hybrid EX sedans equipped with the newly approved Level 3 automated driving equipment which had been granted the safety certification by Japanese government to their autonomous ""Traffic Jam Pilot"" driving technology, and legally allow drivers to take their eyes off the road.[51][52][53][54]\n\nDefinitions and classifications [ edit ]\n\nThere is some inconsistency in the terminology used in the self-driving car industry. Various organizations have proposed to define an accurate and consistent vocabulary.\n\nIn 2014, such confusion has been documented in SAE J3016 which states that ""some vernacular usages associate autonomous specifically with full driving automation (Level 5), while other usages apply it to all levels of driving automation, and some state legislation has defined it to correspond approximately to any ADS [automated driving system] at or above Level 3 (or to any vehicle equipped with such an ADS).""\n\nTerminology and safety considerations [ edit ]\n\nModern vehicles provide features such as keeping the car within its lane, speed controls, or emergency braking. Those features alone are just considered as driver assistance technologies because they still require a human driver control while fully automated vehicles drive themselves without human driver input.\n\nAccording to Fortune, some newer vehicles\' technology names\xe2\x80\x94such as AutonoDrive, PilotAssist, Full-Self Driving or DrivePilot\xe2\x80\x94might confuse the driver, who may believe no driver input is expected when in fact the driver needs to remain involved in the driving task.[55] According to the BBC, confusion between those concepts leads to deaths.[56]\n\nFor this reason, some organizations such as the AAA try to provide standardized naming conventions for features such as ALKS which aim to have capacity to manage the driving task, but which are not yet approved to be an automated vehicles in any countries. The Association of British Insurers considers the usage of the word autonomous in marketing for modern cars to be dangerous because car ads make motorists think \'autonomous\' and \'autopilot\' mean a vehicle can drive itself when they still rely on the driver to ensure safety. Technology alone still is not able to drive the car.\n\nSome car makers suggest or claim vehicles are self-driving when they are not able to manage some driving situations. Despite being called Full Self-Driving, Tesla stated that its offering should not be considered as a fully autonomous driving system.[57] This makes drivers risk becoming excessively confident, taking distracted driving behavior, leading to crashes. While in Great-Britain, a fully self-driving car is only a car registered in a specific list.[58] There have also been proposals to adopt the aviation automation safety knowledge into the discussions of safe implementation of autonomous vehicles, due to the experience that has been gained over the decades by the aviation sector on safety topics. [59]\n\nAutonomous vs. automated [ edit ]\n\nAutonomous means self-governing.[60] Many historical projects related to vehicle automation have been automated (made automatic) subject to a heavy reliance on artificial aids in their environment, such as magnetic strips. Autonomous control implies satisfactory performance under significant uncertainties in the environment, and the ability to compensate for system failures without external intervention.[60]\n\nOne approach is to implement communication networks both in the immediate vicinity (for collision avoidance) and farther away (for congestion management). Such outside influences in the decision process reduce an individual vehicle\'s autonomy, while still not requiring human intervention.\n\nWood et al. (2012) wrote, ""This Article generally uses the term \'autonomous,\' instead of the term \'automated.\' "" The term ""autonomous"" was chosen ""because it is the term that is currently in more widespread use (and thus is more familiar to the general public). However, the latter term is arguably more accurate. \'Automated\' connotes control or operation by a machine, while \'autonomous\' connotes acting alone or independently. Most of the vehicle concepts (that we are currently aware of) have a person in the driver\'s seat, utilize a communication connection to the Cloud or other vehicles, and do not independently select either destinations or routes for reaching them. Thus, the term \'automated\' would more accurately describe these vehicle concepts.""[61]\n\nAs of 2017, most commercial projects focused on automated vehicles that did not communicate with other vehicles or with an enveloping management regime. EuroNCAP defines autonomous in ""Autonomous Emergency Braking"" as: ""the system acts independently of the driver to avoid or mitigate the accident."" which implies the autonomous system is not the driver.[62]\n\nIn Europe, the words automated and autonomous might also be used together. For instance, Regulation (EU) 2019/2144 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2019 on type-approval requirements for motor vehicles (...) defines ""automated vehicle"" and ""fully automated vehicle"" based on their autonomous capacity:[63]\n\n""automated vehicle"" means a motor vehicle designed and constructed to move autonomously for certain periods of time without continuous driver supervision but in respect of which driver intervention is still expected or required; [63]\n\n""fully automated vehicle"" means a motor vehicle that has been designed and constructed to move autonomously without any driver supervision;[63]\n\nIn British English, the word automated alone might have several meaning, such in the sentence: ""Thatcham also found that the automated lane keeping systems could only meet two out of the twelve principles required to guarantee safety, going on to say they cannot, therefore, be classed as \xe2\x80\x98automated driving\xe2\x80\x99, instead it claims the tech should be classed as \xe2\x80\x98assisted driving\xe2\x80\x99."":[64] The first occurrence of the ""automated"" word refers to an Unece automated system, while the second occurrence refers to the British legal definition of an automated vehicle. The British law interprets the meaning of ""automated vehicle"" based on the interpretation section related to a vehicle ""driving itself"" and an insured vehicle.[65]\n\nAutonomous versus cooperative [ edit ]\n\nTo enable a car to travel without any driver embedded within the vehicle, some companies use a remote driver.[66]\n\nAccording to SAE J3016,\n\nSome driving automation systems may indeed be autonomous if they perform all of their functions independently and self-sufficiently, but if they depend on communication and/or cooperation with outside entities, they should be considered cooperative rather than autonomous.\n\nClassifications [ edit ]\n\nSelf-driving car [ edit ]\n\nPC Magazine defines a self-driving car as ""a computer-controlled car that drives itself.""[67] The Union of Concerned Scientists states that self-driving cars are ""cars or trucks in which human drivers are never required to take control to safely operate the vehicle. Also known as autonomous or \'driverless\' cars, they combine sensors and software to control, navigate, and drive the vehicle.""[68]\n\nThe British Automated and Electric Vehicles Act 2018 law defines considers a vehicle as ""driving itself"" if the vehicle ""is operating in a mode in which it is not being controlled, and does not need to be monitored, by an individual"".[69]\n\nSAE Classification [ edit ]\n\nA classification system with six levels \xe2\x80\x93 ranging from fully manual to fully automated systems \xe2\x80\x93 was published in 2014 by automotive standardization body SAE International (formerly the Society of Automotive Engineers) as J3016, Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to On-Road Motor Vehicle Automated Driving Systems.[72][73] This classification is based on the amount of driver intervention and attentiveness required, rather than the vehicle\'s capabilities, although these are loosely related. In the United States in 2013, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) released a formal classification system,[74] but abandoned it in favor of the SAE standard in 2016. Also in 2016, SAE updated its classification, called J3016_201609.[75]\n\nLevels of driving automation [ edit ]\n\nIn SAE\'s automation level definitions, ""driving mode"" means ""a type of driving scenario with characteristic dynamic driving task requirements (e.g., expressway merging, high speed cruising, low speed traffic jam, closed-campus operations, etc.)""[1][76]\n\nLevel 0: The automated system issues warnings and may momentarily intervene but has no sustained vehicle control.\n\nLevel 1 (""hands on""): The driver and the automated system share control of the vehicle. Examples are systems where the driver controls steering and the automated system controls engine power to maintain a set speed (Cruise Control) or engine and brake power to maintain and vary speed (Adaptive Cruise Control or ACC); and Parking Assistance, where steering is automated while speed is under manual control. The driver must be ready to retake full control at any time. Lane Keeping Assistance (LKA) Type II is a further example of Level 1 self-driving. Automatic emergency braking which alerts the driver to a crash and permits full braking capacity is also a Level 1 feature, according to Autopilot Review magazine. [77]\n\nmagazine. Level 2 (""hands off""): The automated system takes full control of the vehicle: accelerating, braking, and steering. The driver must monitor the driving and be prepared to intervene immediately at any time if the automated system fails to respond properly. The shorthand ""hands off"" is not meant to be taken literally \xe2\x80\x93 contact between hand and wheel is often mandatory during SAE 2 driving, to confirm that the driver is ready to intervene. The eyes of the driver might be monitored by cameras to confirm that the driver is keeping their attention to traffic. Literal hands off driving is considered level 2.5, although there is no half levels officially. A common example is adaptive cruise control which also utilizes lane keeping assist technology so that the driver simply monitors the vehicle, such as ""Super-Cruise"" in the Cadillac CT6 by General Motors or Ford\'s F-150 BlueCruise. [78]\n\nLevel 3 (""eyes off""): The driver can safely turn their attention away from the driving tasks, e.g. the driver can text or watch a movie. The vehicle will handle situations that call for an immediate response, like emergency braking. The driver must still be prepared to intervene within some limited time, specified by the manufacturer, when called upon by the vehicle to do so. You can think of the automated system as a co-driver that will alert you in an orderly fashion when it is your turn to drive. An example would be a Traffic Jam Chauffeur, [79] another example would be a car satisfying the international Automated Lane Keeping System (ALKS) regulations. [80]\n\nanother example would be a car satisfying the international Automated Lane Keeping System (ALKS) regulations. Level 4 (""mind off""): As level 3, but no driver attention is ever required for safety, e.g. the driver may safely go to sleep or leave the driver\'s seat. However, self-driving is supported only in limited spatial areas (geofenced) or under special circumstances. Outside of these areas or circumstances, the vehicle must be able to safely abort the trip, e.g. slow down and park the car, if the driver does not retake control. An example would be a robotic taxi or a robotic delivery service that covers selected locations in an area, at a specific time and quantities.\n\nLevel 5 (""steering wheel optional""): No human intervention is required at all. An example would be a robotic vehicle that works on all kinds of surfaces, all over the world, all year around, in all weather conditions.\n\nIn the formal SAE definition below, an important transition is from SAE Level 2 to SAE Level 3 in which the human driver is no longer expected to monitor the environment continuously. At SAE 3, the human driver still has responsibility to intervene when asked to do so by the automated system. At SAE 4 the human driver is always relieved of that responsibility and at SAE 5 the automated system will never need to ask for an intervention.\n\nSAE (J3016) Automation Levels[76] SAE Level Name Narrative definition Execution of\n\nsteering and\n\nacceleration/\n\ndeceleration Monitoring of driving environment Fallback performance of dynamic driving task System capability (driving modes) Human driver monitors the driving environment 0 No Automation The full-time performance by the human driver of all aspects of the dynamic driving task, even when ""enhanced by warning or intervention systems"" Human driver Human driver Human driver n/a 1 Driver Assistance The driving mode-specific execution by a driver assistance system of ""either steering or acceleration/deceleration"" using information about the driving environment and with the expectation that the human driver performs all remaining aspects of the dynamic driving task Human driver and system Some driving modes 2 Partial Automation The driving mode-specific execution by one or more driver assistance systems of both steering and acceleration/deceleration System Automated driving system monitors the driving environment 3 Conditional Automation The driving mode-specific performance by an automated driving system of all aspects of the dynamic driving task with the expectation that the human driver will respond appropriately to a request to intervene System System Human driver Some driving modes 4 High Automation even if a human driver does not respond appropriately to a request to intervene the car can pull over safely by guiding system System Many driving modes 5 Full Automation under all roadway and environmental conditions that can be managed by a human driver All driving modes\n\nCriticism of SAE [ edit ]\n\nThe SAE Automation Levels have been criticized for their technological focus. It has been argued that the structure of the levels suggests that automation increases linearly and that more automation is better, which may not always be the case.[81] The SAE Levels also do not account for changes that may be required to infrastructure[82] and road user behavior.[83][84]\n\nTechnology [ edit ]\n\nThe characteristics of autonomous vehicles, as digital technology, are distinguishable from other types of technologies and vehicles. These characteristics mean autonomous vehicles are able to be more transformative and agile to possible changes. The characteristics include hybrid navigation, homogenization and decoupling, vehicle communication systems, reprogrammable and smart, digital traces and modularity.\n\nHybrid navigation [ edit ]\n\nThere are different systems that help the self-driving car control the car, including the car navigation system, the location system, the electronic map, the map matching, the global path planning, the environment perception, the laser perception, the radar perception, the visual perception, the vehicle control, the perception of vehicle speed and direction, and the vehicle control method.[85]\n\nDriverless car designers are challenged with producing control systems capable of analyzing sensory data in order to provide accurate detection of other vehicles and the road ahead.[86] Modern self-driving cars generally use Bayesian simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms,[87] which fuse data from multiple sensors and an off-line map into current location estimates and map updates. Waymo has developed a variant of SLAM with detection and tracking of other moving objects (DATMO), which also handles obstacles such as cars and pedestrians. Simpler systems may use roadside real-time locating system (RTLS) technologies to aid localization. Typical sensors include lidar (Light Detection and Ranging), stereo vision, GPS and IMU.[88][89] Control systems on automated cars may use Sensor Fusion, which is an approach that integrates information from a variety of sensors on the car to produce a more consistent, accurate, and useful view of the environment.[90] Heavy rainfall, hail, or snow could impede the car sensors.[citation needed]\n\nDriverless vehicles require some form of machine vision for the purpose of visual object recognition. Automated cars are being developed with deep neural networks,[88] a type of deep learning architecture with many computational stages, or levels, in which neurons are simulated from the environment that activate the network.[91] The neural network depends on an extensive amount of data extracted from real-life driving scenarios,[88] enabling the neural network to ""learn"" how to execute the best course of action.[91]\n\nIn May 2018, researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology announced that they had built an automated car that can navigate unmapped roads.[92] Researchers at their Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) have developed a new system, called MapLite, which allows self-driving cars to drive on roads that they have never been on before, without using 3D maps. The system combines the GPS position of the vehicle, a ""sparse topological map"" such as OpenStreetMap, (i.e. having 2D features of the roads only), and a series of sensors that observe the road conditions.[93]\n\nHomogenization and decoupling [ edit ]\n\nHomogenization indicates the fact that all digital information assumes the same form. During the ongoing evolution of the digital era, certain industry standards have been developed on how to store digital information and in what type of format. This concept of homogenization also applies to autonomous vehicles. In order for autonomous vehicles to perceive their surroundings, they have to use different techniques each with their own accompanying digital information (e.g. radar, GPS, motion sensors and computer vision). Homogenization requires that the digital information from these different sources is transmitted and stored in the same form. This means their differences are decoupled, and digital information can be transmitted, stored, and computed in a way that the vehicles and their operating system can better understand and act upon it. Homogenization also helps to take advantage of the exponential increase of the computing power of hardware and software (Moore\'s law) which also supports the autonomous vehicles to understand and act upon the digital information in a more cost-effective way, therefore lowering the marginal costs.[citation needed]\n\nVehicle communication systems [ edit ]\n\nIndividual vehicles can benefit from information obtained from other vehicles in the vicinity, especially information relating to traffic congestion and safety hazards. Vehicular communication systems use vehicles and roadside units as the communicating nodes in a peer-to-peer network, providing each other with information. As a cooperative approach, vehicular communication systems can allow all cooperating vehicles to be more effective. According to a 2010 study by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, vehicular communication systems could help avoid up to 79% of all traffic accidents.[94]\n\nThere have so far been no complete implementation of peer-to-peer networking on the scale required for traffic.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2012, computer scientists at the University of Texas in Austin began developing smart intersections designed for automated cars. The intersections will have no traffic lights and no stop signs, instead using computer programs that will communicate directly with each car on the road.[95] In the case of autonomous vehicles, it is essential for them to connect with other \'devices\' in order to function most effectively. Autonomous vehicles are equipped with communication systems which allow them to communicate with other autonomous vehicles and roadside units to provide them, amongst other things, with information about road work or traffic congestion. In addition, scientists believe that the future will have computer programs that connect and manage each individual autonomous vehicle as it navigates through an intersection. This type of connectivity must replace traffic lights and stop signs.[95] These types of characteristics drive and further develop the ability of autonomous vehicles to understand and cooperate with other products and services (such as intersection computer systems) in the autonomous vehicles market. This could lead to a network of autonomous vehicles all using the same network and information available on that network. Eventually, this can lead to more autonomous vehicles using the network because the information has been validated through the usage of other autonomous vehicles. Such movements will strengthen the value of the network and is called network externalities.\n\nAmong connected cars, an unconnected one is the weakest and will be increasingly banned from busy high-speed roads, as predicted by the Helsinki think tank, Nordic Communications Corporation, in January 2016.[96]\n\nIn 2017, Researchers from Arizona State University developed a 1/10 scale intersection and proposed an intersection management technique called Crossroads. It was shown that Crossroads is very resilient to network delay of both V2I communication and Worst-case Execution time of the intersection manager.[97] In 2018, a robust approach was introduced which is resilient to both model mismatch and external disturbances such as wind and bumps.[98]\n\nVehicle networking may be desirable due to difficulty with computer vision being able to recognize brake lights, turn signals, buses, and similar things. However, the usefulness of such systems would be diminished by the fact current cars are not equipped with them; they may also pose privacy concerns.[99]\n\nReprogrammable [ edit ]\n\nAnother characteristic of autonomous vehicles is that the core product will have a greater emphasis on the software and its possibilities, instead of the chassis and its engine. This is because autonomous vehicles have software systems that drive the vehicle, meaning that updates through reprogramming or editing the software can enhance the benefits of the owner (e.g. update in better distinguishing blind person vs. non-blind person so that the vehicle will take extra caution when approaching a blind person). A characteristic of this reprogrammable part of autonomous vehicles is that the updates need not only to come from the supplier, because through machine learning, smart autonomous vehicles can generate certain updates and install them accordingly (e.g. new navigation maps or new intersection computer systems). These reprogrammable characteristics of the digital technology and the possibility of smart machine learning give manufacturers of autonomous vehicles the opportunity to differentiate themselves on software. This also implies that autonomous vehicles are never finished because the product can continuously be improved.[citation needed]\n\nDigital traces [ edit ]\n\nAutonomous vehicles are equipped with different sorts of sensors and radars. As said, this allows them to connect and interoperate with computers from other autonomous vehicles and/or roadside units. This implies that autonomous vehicles leave digital traces when they connect or interoperate. The data that comes from these digital traces can be used to develop new (to be determined) products or updates to enhance autonomous vehicles\' driving ability or safety.[citation needed]\n\nModularity [ edit ]\n\nTraditional vehicles and their accompanying technologies are manufactured as a product that will be complete, and unlike autonomous vehicles, they can only be improved if they are redesigned or reproduced. As said, autonomous vehicles are produced but due to their digital characteristics never finished. This is because autonomous vehicles are more modular since they are made up out of several modules which will be explained hereafter through a Layered Modular Architecture. The Layered Modular Architecture extends the architecture of purely physical vehicles by incorporating four loosely coupled layers of devices, networks, services and contents into Autonomous Vehicles. These loosely coupled layers can interact through certain standardized interfaces.\n\n(1) The first layer of this architecture consists of the device layer. This layer consists of the following two parts: logical capability and physical machinery. The physical machinery refers to the actual vehicle itself (e.g. chassis and carrosserie). When it comes to digital technologies, the physical machinery is accompanied by a logical capability layer in the form of operating systems that helps to guide the vehicles itself and make it autonomous. The logical capability provides control over the vehicle and connects it with the other layers.;\n\n(2) On top of the device layer comes the network layer. This layer also consists of two different parts: physical transport and logical transmission. The physical transport layer refers to the radars, sensors and cables of the autonomous vehicles which enable the transmission of digital information. Next to that, the network layer of autonomous vehicles also has a logical transmission which contains communication protocols and network standard to communicate the digital information with other networks and platforms or between layers. This increases the accessibility of the autonomous vehicles and enables the computational power of a network or platform.;\n\n(3) The service layer contains the applications and their functionalities that serves the autonomous vehicle (and its owners) as they extract, create, store and consume content with regards to their own driving history, traffic congestion, roads or parking abilities for example.; and\n\n(4) The final layer of the model is the contents layer. This layer contains the sounds, images and videos. The autonomous vehicles store, extract and use to act upon and improve their driving and understanding of the environment. The contents layer also provides metadata and directory information about the content\'s origin, ownership, copyright, encoding methods, content tags, geo-time stamps, and so on (Yoo et al., 2010).\n\nThe consequence of layered modular architecture of autonomous vehicles (and other digital technologies) is that it enables the emergence and development of platforms and ecosystems around a product and/or certain modules of that product. Traditionally, automotive vehicles were developed, manufactured and maintained by traditional manufacturers. Nowadays app developers and content creators can help to develop more comprehensive product experience for the consumers which creates a platform around the product of autonomous vehicles.\n\nChallenges [ edit ]\n\nThe potential benefits from increased vehicle automation described may be limited by foreseeable challenges such as disputes over liability,[100][101] the time needed to turn over the existing stock of vehicles from non-automated to automated,[102] and thus a long period of humans and autonomous vehicles sharing the roads, resistance by individuals to forfeiting control of their cars,[103] concerns about safety,[104] and the implementation of a legal framework and consistent global government regulations for self-driving cars.[105]\n\nOther obstacles could include de-skilling and lower levels of driver experience for dealing with potentially dangerous situations and anomalies,[106] ethical problems where an automated vehicle\'s software is forced during an unavoidable crash to choose between multiple harmful courses of action (\'the trolley problem\'),[107][108] concerns about making large numbers of people currently employed as drivers unemployed, the potential for more intrusive mass surveillance of location, association and travel as a result of police and intelligence agency access to large data sets generated by sensors and pattern-recognition AI, and possibly insufficient understanding of verbal sounds, gestures and non-verbal cues by police, other drivers or pedestrians.[109]\n\nAutonomous delivery vehicles stuck in one place by attempting to avoid one another.\n\nPossible technological obstacles for automated cars are:\n\nArtificial Intelligence is still not able to function properly in chaotic inner-city environments. [110]\n\nA car\'s computer could potentially be compromised, as could a communication system between cars. [111] [112] [113] [114] [115]\n\nSusceptibility of the car\'s sensing and navigation systems to different types of weather (such as snow) or deliberate interference, including jamming and spoofing. [109]\n\nAvoidance of large animals requires recognition and tracking, and Volvo found that software suited to caribou, deer, and elk was ineffective with kangaroos. [116]\n\nAutonomous cars may require high-definition maps to operate properly. Where these maps may be out of date, they would need to be able to fall back to reasonable behaviors.\n\nCompetition for the radio spectrum desired for the car\'s communication. [117]\n\nField programmability for the systems will require careful evaluation of product development and the component supply chain. [115]\n\nCurrent road infrastructure may need changes for automated cars to function optimally. [118]\n\nValidation challenge of Automated Driving and need for novel simulation-based approaches comprising digital twins and agent-based traffic simulation.[119]\n\nSocial challenges include:\n\nUncertainty about potential future regulation may delay deployment of automated cars on the road. [120]\n\nEmployment \xe2\x80\x93 Companies working on the technology have an increasing recruitment problem in that the available talent pool has not grown with demand.[121] As such, education and training by third-party organizations such as providers of online courses and self-taught community-driven projects such as DIY Robocars[122] and Formula Pi have quickly grown in popularity, while university level extra-curricular programmes such as Formula Student Driverless[123] have bolstered graduate experience. Industry is steadily increasing freely available information sources, such as code,[124] datasets[125] and glossaries[126] to widen the recruitment pool.\n\nHuman factor [ edit ]\n\nSelf-driving cars are already exploring the difficulties of determining the intentions of pedestrians, bicyclists, and animals, and models of behavior must be programmed into driving algorithms.[8] Human road users also have the challenge of determining the intentions of autonomous vehicles, where there is no driver with which to make eye contact or exchange hand signals. Drive.ai is testing a solution to this problem that involves LED signs mounted on the outside of the vehicle, announcing status such as ""going now, don\'t cross"" vs. ""waiting for you to cross"".[127]\n\nTwo human-factor challenges are important for safety. One is the handoff from automated driving to manual driving, which may become necessary due to unfavorable or unusual road conditions, or if the vehicle has limited capabilities. A sudden handoff could leave a human driver dangerously unprepared in the moment. In the long term, humans who have less practice at driving might have a lower skill level and thus be more dangerous in manual mode. The second challenge is known as risk compensation: as a system is perceived to be safer, instead of benefiting entirely from all of the increased safety, people engage in riskier behavior and enjoy other benefits. Semi-automated cars have been shown to suffer from this problem, for example with users of Tesla Autopilot ignoring the road and using electronic devices or other activities against the advice of the company that the car is not capable of being completely autonomous. In the near future, pedestrians and bicyclists may travel in the street in a riskier fashion if they believe self-driving cars are capable of avoiding them.\n\nIn order for people to buy self-driving cars and vote for the government to allow them on roads, the technology must be trusted as safe.[128][129] Self-driving elevators were invented in 1900, but the high number of people refusing to use them slowed adoption for several decades until operator strikes increased demand and trust was built with advertising and features like the emergency stop button.[130][131] There are three types of trust between human and automation.[132] There is dispositional trust, the trust between the driver and the company\'s product.[132] Situational trust, or the trust from different scenarios.[132] Finally there is learned trust where the trust is built between similar events.[132]\n\nMoral issues [ edit ]\n\nWith the emergence of automated automobiles, various ethical issues arise. While the introduction of automated vehicles to the mass market is said to be inevitable due to a presumed but untestable potential for reduction of crashes by ""up to"" 90%[133] and their potential greater accessibility to disabled, elderly, and young passengers, a range of ethical issues have been posed. Those include, but are not limited to:\n\nThe moral, financial, and criminal responsibility for crashes and breaches of law\n\nThe decisions a car is to make right before a potentially fatal crash\n\nPrivacy issues, including the potential for mass surveillance\n\nPotential for massive job losses and unemployment among drivers\n\nDe-skilling and loss of independence by vehicle users\n\nExposure to hacking and malware\n\nThe further concentration of market and data power in the hands of a few global conglomerates capable of consolidating AI capacity and of lobbying governments to facilitate the shift of liability onto others and their potential destruction of existing occupations and industries.\n\nThere are different opinions on who should be held liable in case of a crash, especially with people being hurt. Many experts see the car manufacturers themselves being responsible for those crashes that occur due to a technical malfunction or misconstruction.[134] Besides the fact that the car manufacturer would be the source of the problem in a situation where a car crashes due to a technical issue, there is another important reason why car manufacturers could be held responsible: it would encourage them to innovate and heavily invest into fixing those issues, not only due to protection of the brand image, but also due to financial and criminal consequences. However, there are also voices[who?] that argue those using or owning the vehicle should be held responsible since they know the risks involved in using such a vehicle. One study suggests requesting the owners of self-driving cars to sign end-user license agreements (EULAs), assigning to them accountability for any accidents.[135] Other studies suggest introducing a tax or insurances that would protect owners and users of automated vehicles of claims made by victims of an accident.[134] Other possible parties that can be held responsible in case of a technical failure include software engineers that programmed the code for the automated operation of the vehicles, and suppliers of components of the AV.[136]\n\nTaking aside the question of legal liability and moral responsibility, the question arises how automated vehicles should be programmed to behave in an emergency situation where either passengers or other traffic participants like pedestrians, bicyclists and other drivers are endangered. A moral dilemma that a software engineer or car manufacturer might face in programming the operating software is described in an ethical thought experiment, the trolley problem: a conductor of a trolley has the choice of staying on the planned track and running over five people, or turn the trolley onto a track where it would kill only one person, assuming there is no traffic on it.[137] When a self-driving car is in following scenario: it\'s driving with passengers and suddenly a person appears in its way. The car has to decide between the two options, either to run the person over or to avoid hitting the person by swerving into a wall, killing the passengers.[138] There are two main considerations that need to be addressed. First, what moral basis would be used by an automated vehicle to make decisions? Second, how could those be translated into software code? Researchers have suggested, in particular, two ethical theories to be applicable to the behavior of automated vehicles in cases of emergency: deontology and utilitarianism.[8][139] Asimov\'s Three Laws of Robotics are a typical example of deontological ethics. The theory suggests that an automated car needs to follow strict written-out rules that it needs to follow in any situation. Utilitarianism suggests the idea that any decision must be made based on the goal to maximize utility. This needs a definition of utility which could be maximizing the number of people surviving in a crash. Critics suggest that automated vehicles should adapt a mix of multiple theories to be able to respond morally right in the instance of a crash.[8][139] Recently, some specific ethical frameworks i.e., utilitarianism, deontology, relativism, absolutism (monism), and pluralism, are investigated empirically with respect to the acceptance of self-driving cars in unavoidable accidents.[140]\n\nMany \'trolley\' discussions skip over the practical problems of how a probabilistic machine learning vehicle AI could be sophisticated enough to understand that a deep problem of moral philosophy is presenting itself from instant to instant while using a dynamic projection into the near future, what sort of moral problem it actually would be if any, what the relevant weightings in human value terms should be given to all the other humans involved who will be probably unreliably identified, and how reliably it can assess the probable outcomes. These practical difficulties, and those around testing and assessment of solutions to them, may present as much of a challenge as the theoretical abstractions.[141]\n\nWhile most trolley conundrums involve hyperbolic and unlikely fact patterns, it is inevitable mundane ethical decisions and risk calculations such as the precise millisecond a car should yield to a yellow light or how closely to drive to a bike lane will need to be programmed into the software of autonomous vehicles.[8][142] Mundane ethical situations may even be more relevant than rare fatal circumstances because of the specificity implicated and their large scope.[142] Mundane situations involving drivers and pedestrians are so prevalent that, in the aggregate, produce large amounts of injuries and deaths.[142] Hence, even incremental permutations of moral algorithms can have a notable effect when considered in their entirety.[142]\n\nPrivacy-related issues arise mainly from the interconnectivity of automated cars, making it just another mobile device that can gather any information about an individual (see data mining). This information gathering ranges from tracking of the routes taken, voice recording, video recording, preferences in media that is consumed in the car, behavioral patterns, to many more streams of information.[99][143][144] The data and communications infrastructure needed to support these vehicles may also be capable of surveillance, especially if coupled to other data sets and advanced analytics.[99]\n\nThe implementation of automated vehicles to the mass market might cost up to 5 million jobs in the US alone, making up almost 3% of the workforce.[145] Those jobs include drivers of taxis, buses, vans, trucks, and e-hailing vehicles. Many industries, such as the auto insurance industry are indirectly affected. This industry alone generates an annual revenue of about US$220 billion, supporting 277,000 jobs.[146] To put this into perspective\xe2\x80\x93this is about the number of mechanical engineering jobs.[147] The potential loss of a majority of those jobs will have a tremendous impact on those individuals involved.[148]\n\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has animated the trolley problem in the context of autonomous cars in a website called The Moral Machine.[149] The Moral Machine generates random scenarios in which autonomous cars malfunction and forces the user to choose between two harmful courses of action.[149] MIT\'s Moral Machine experiment has collected data involving over 40 million decisions from people in 233 countries to ascertain peoples\' moral preferences. The MIT study illuminates that ethical preferences vary among cultures and demographics and likely correlate with modern institutions and geographic traits.[149]\n\nGlobal trends of the MIT study highlight that, overall, people prefer to save the lives of humans over other animals, prioritize the lives of many rather than few, and spare the lives of young rather than old.[149] Men are slightly more likely to spare the lives of women, and religious affiliates are slightly more likely to prioritize human life. The lives of criminals were prioritized more than cats, but the lives of dogs were prioritized more than the lives of criminals.[150] The lives of homeless were spared more than the elderly, but the lives of homeless were spared less often than the obese.[150]\n\nPeople overwhelmingly express a preference for autonomous vehicles to be programmed with utilitarian ideas, that is, in a manner that generates the least harm and minimizes driving casualties.[151] While people want others to purchase utilitarian promoting vehicles, they themselves prefer to ride in vehicles that prioritize the lives of people inside the vehicle at all costs.[151] This presents a paradox in which people prefer that others drive utilitarian vehicles designed to maximize the lives preserved in a fatal situation but want to ride in cars that prioritize the safety of passengers at all costs.[151] People disapprove of regulations that promote utilitarian views and would be less willing to purchase a self-driving car that may opt to promote the greatest good at the expense of its passengers.[151]\n\nBonnefon et al. conclude that the regulation of autonomous vehicle ethical prescriptions may be counterproductive to societal safety.[151] This is because, if the government mandates utilitarian ethics and people prefer to ride in self-protective cars, it could prevent the large scale implementation of self-driving cars.[151] Delaying the adoption of autonomous cars vitiates the safety of society as a whole because this technology is projected to save so many lives.[151] This is a paradigmatic example of the tragedy of the commons, in which rational actors cater to their self-interested preferences at the expense of societal utility.[152]\n\nTesting [ edit ]\n\nTo make a car 95% as safe as an experienced driver, 275 million failure-free autonomous miles (400 M km) are needed while several billions miles (or kilometers) are needed to make them 10% or 20% safer than humans.[153]\n\nThe testing of vehicles with varying degrees of automation can be carried out either physically, in a closed environment[154] or, where permitted, on public roads (typically requiring a license or permit,[155] or adhering to a specific set of operating principles),[156] or in a virtual environment, i.e. using computer simulations.[157][158] When driven on public roads, automated vehicles require a person to monitor their proper operation and ""take over"" when needed. For example, New York state has strict requirements for the test driver, such that the vehicle can be corrected at all times by a licensed operator; highlighted by Cardian Cube Company\'s application and discussions with New York State officials and the NYS DMV.[159]\n\nApple is testing self-driving cars, and has increased its fleet of test vehicles from three in April 2017, to 27 in January 2018, and 45 by March 2018.[160][161]\n\nRussian internet-company Yandex started to develop self-driving cars in early 2017. The first driverless prototype was launched in May 2017. In November 2017, Yandex released a video of its AV winter tests.[162] The car drove successfully along snowy roads of Moscow. In June 2018, Yandex self-driving vehicle completed a 485-mile (780 km) trip on a federal highway from Moscow to Kazan in autonomous mode.[163][164] In August 2018, Yandex launched a Europe\'s first robotaxi service with no human driver behind the wheel in the Russian town of Innopolis.[165] At the beginning of 2020 it was reported that over 5,000 autonomous passenger rides were made in the city.[166] At the end of 2018, Yandex obtained a license to operate autonomous vehicles on public roads in the U.S. state of Nevada. In 2019 and 2020, Yandex cars carried out demo rides for Consumer Electronic Show visitors in Las Vegas. Yandex cars were circulating the streets of the city without any human control.[167][168] In 2019 Yandex started testing its self-driving cars on the public roads of Israel.[169] In October 2019, Yandex became one of the companies selected by Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) to provide autonomous passenger rides to the visitors of Detroit Autoshow 2020.[170] At the end of 2019, Yandex made an announcement its self-driving cars passed 1 million miles in fully autonomous mode in Russia, Israel, and the United States.[171] In February 2020, Yandex doubled its mileage with 2 million miles passed.[172] In 2020, Yandex started to test its self-driving cars in Michigan.[173]\n\nThe progress of automated vehicles can be assessed by computing the average distance driven between ""disengagements"", when the automated system is switched off, typically by the intervention of a human driver. In 2017, Waymo reported 63 disengagements over 352,545 mi (567,366 km) of testing, an average distance of 5,596 mi (9,006 km) between disengagements, the highest among companies reporting such figures. Waymo also traveled a greater total distance than any of the other companies. Their 2017 rate of 0.18 disengagements per 1,000 mi (1,600 km) was an improvement over the 0.2 disengagements per 1,000 mi (1,600 km) in 2016, and 0.8 in 2015. In March 2017, Uber reported an average of just 0.67 mi (1.08 km) per disengagement. In the final three months of 2017, Cruise (now owned by GM) averaged 5,224 mi (8,407 km) per disengagement over a total distance of 62,689 mi (100,888 km).[174] In July 2018, the first electric driverless racing car, ""Robocar"", completed a 1.8-kilometer track, using its navigation system and artificial intelligence.[175]\n\nDistance between disengagement and total distance traveled autonomously Car maker California, 2016[174] California, 2018[176] California, 2019[177] Distance between\n\ndisengagements Total distance traveled Distance between\n\ndisengagements Total distance traveled Distance between\n\ndisengagements Total distance traveled Waymo 5,128 mi (8,253 km) 635,868 mi (1,023,330 km) 11,154 mi (17,951 km) 1,271,587 mi (2,046,421 km) 11,017 mi (17,730 km) 1,450,000 mi (2,330,000 km) BMW 638 mi (1,027 km) 638 mi (1,027 km) Nissan 263 mi (423 km) 6,056 mi (9,746 km) 210 mi (340 km) 5,473 mi (8,808 km) Ford 197 mi (317 km) 590 mi (950 km) General Motors 55 mi (89 km) 8,156 mi (13,126 km) 5,205 mi (8,377 km) 447,621 mi (720,376 km) 12,221 mi (19,668 km) 831,040 mi (1,337,430 km) Delphi Automotive Systems 15 mi (24 km) 2,658 mi (4,278 km) Tesla 3 mi (4.8 km) 550 mi (890 km) Mercedes-Benz 2 mi (3.2 km) 673 mi (1,083 km) 1.5 mi (2.4 km) 1,749 mi (2,815 km) Bosch 7 mi (11 km) 983 mi (1,582 km) Zoox 1,923 mi (3,095 km) 30,764 mi (49,510 km) 1,595 mi (2,567 km) 67,015 mi (107,850 km) Nuro 1,028 mi (1,654 km) 24,680 mi (39,720 km) 2,022 mi (3,254 km) 68,762 mi (110,662 km) Pony.ai 1,022 mi (1,645 km) 16,356 mi (26,322 km) 6,476 mi (10,422 km) 174,845 mi (281,386 km) Baidu (Apolong) 206 mi (332 km) 18,093 mi (29,118 km) 18,050 mi (29,050 km) 108,300 mi (174,300 km) Aurora 100 mi (160 km) 32,858 mi (52,880 km) 280 mi (450 km) 39,729 mi (63,938 km) Apple 1.1 mi (1.8 km) 79,745 mi (128,337 km) 118 mi (190 km) 7,544 mi (12,141 km) Uber 0.4 mi (0.64 km) 26,899 mi (43,290 km) 0 mi (0 km)\n\nApplications [ edit ]\n\nAutonomous trucks and vans [ edit ]\n\nCompanies such as Otto and Starsky Robotics have focused on autonomous trucks. Automation of trucks is important, not only due to the improved safety aspects of these very heavy vehicles, but also due to the ability of fuel savings through platooning. Autonomous vans are being used by online grocers such as Ocado.[citation needed]\n\nResearch has also indicated that goods distribution on the macro (urban distribution) and micro level (last mile delivery) could be made more efficient with the use of autonomous vehicles [178] thanks to the possibility of smaller vehicle sizes.\n\nTransport systems [ edit ]\n\nChina trialed the first automated public bus in Henan province in 2015, on a highway linking Zhengzhou and Kaifeng.[179][180] Baidu and King Long produce automated minibus, a vehicle with 14 seats, but without driving seat. With 100 vehicles produced, 2018 will be the first year with commercial automated service in China.[181][182]\n\nIn Europe, cities in Belgium, France, Italy and the UK are planning to operate transport systems for automated cars,[183][184][185] and Germany, the Netherlands, and Spain have allowed public testing in traffic. In 2015, the UK launched public trials of the LUTZ Pathfinder automated pod in Milton Keynes.[186] Beginning in summer 2015, the French government allowed PSA Peugeot-Citroen to make trials in real conditions in the Paris area. The experiments were planned to be extended to other cities such as Bordeaux and Strasbourg by 2016.[187] The alliance between French companies THALES and Valeo (provider of the first self-parking car system that equips Audi and Mercedes premi) is testing its own system.[188] New Zealand is planning to use automated vehicles for public transport in Tauranga and Christchurch.[189][190][191][192]\n\nImpact [ edit ]\n\nAutomobile industry [ edit ]\n\nThe traditional automobile industry is subject to changes driven by technology and market demands. These changes include breakthrough technological advances and when the market demands and adopts new technology quickly. In the rapid advance of both factors, the end of the era of incremental change was recognized. When the transition is made to new technology, new entrants to the automotive industry present themselves, which can be distinguished as mobility providers such as Uber and Lyft, as well as tech giants such as Google and Nvidia.[193] As new entrants to the industry arise, market uncertainty naturally occurs due to the changing dynamics. For example, the entrance of tech giants, as well as the alliances between them and traditional car manufacturers causes a variation in the innovation and production process of autonomous vehicles. Additionally, the entrance of mobility providers has caused ambiguous user preferences. As a result of the rise of mobility providers, the number of vehicles per capita has flatlined. In addition, the rise of the sharing economy also contributes to market uncertainty and causes forecasters to question whether personal ownership of vehicles is still relevant as new transportation technology and mobility providers are becoming preferred among consumers.\n\nTo help reduce the possibility of safety issues, some companies have begun to open-source parts of their driverless systems. Udacity for instance is developing an open-source software stack,[194] and some companies are having similar approaches.[195][196]\n\nHealth [ edit ]\n\nAccording to a 2020 Annual Review of Public Health review of the literature, self-driving cars ""could increase some health risks (such as air pollution, noise, and sedentarism); however, if properly regulated, AVs will likely reduce morbidity and mortality from motor vehicle crashes and may help reshape cities to promote healthy urban environments.""[197] Driving safety experts predict that once driverless technology has been fully developed, traffic collisions (and resulting deaths and injuries and costs) caused by human error, such as delayed reaction time, tailgating, rubbernecking, and other forms of distracted or aggressive driving should be substantially reduced.[1][198][199][200][201] With the increasing reliance of autonomous vehicles on interconnectivity and the availability of big data which is made usable in the form of real-time maps, driving decisions can be made much faster in order to prevent collisions.[8]\n\nNumbers made available by the US government state that 94% of vehicle accidents are due to human failures.[202] As a result, major implications for the healthcare industry become apparent. Numbers from the National Safety Council on killed and injured people on US roads multiplied by the average costs of a single incident reveal that an estimated US$500 billion loss may be imminent for the US healthcare industry when autonomous vehicles are dominating the roads. It is likely the anticipated decrease in traffic accidents will positively contribute to the widespread acceptance of autonomous vehicles, as well as the possibility to better allocate healthcare resources. If 90% of cars in the US became self-driving, for example, an estimated 25,000 lives would be saved annually. Lives saved by averting automobile crashes in the US has been valued at more than $200 billion annually.[197]\n\nSelf-driving car would have the potential to save 10 million lives worldwide, per decade.[203][197]\n\nAccording to motorist website ""TheDrive.com"" operated by Time magazine, none of the driving safety experts they were able to contact was able to rank driving under an autopilot system at the time (2017) as having achieved a greater level of safety than traditional fully hands-on driving, so the degree to which these benefits asserted by proponents will manifest in practice cannot be assessed.[204] Confounding factors that could reduce the net effect on safety may include unexpected interactions between humans and partly or fully automated vehicles, or between different types of a vehicle system; complications at the boundaries of functionality at each automation level (such as handover when the vehicle reaches the limit of its capacity); the effect of the bugs and flaws that inevitably occur in complex interdependent software systems; sensor or data shortcomings; and successful compromise by malicious interveners. Security problems include what an autonomous car might do if summoned to pick up the owner but another person attempts entry, what happens if someone tries to break into the car, and what happens if someone attacks the occupants, for example by exchanging gunfire.[205]\n\nSome[who?] believe that once automation in vehicles reaches higher levels and becomes reliable, drivers will pay less attention to the road.[206] Research shows that drivers in automated cars react later when they have to intervene in a critical situation, compared to if they were driving manually.[207] Depending on the capabilities of automated vehicles and the frequency with which human intervention is needed, this may counteract any increase in safety, as compared to all-human driving, that may be delivered by other factors.\n\nAn unexpected disadvantage of the widespread acceptance of autonomous vehicles would be a reduction in the supply of organs for donation.[208] In the US, for example, 13% of the organ donation supply comes from car crash victims.[197]\n\nWelfare [ edit ]\n\nAccording to a 2020 study, self-driving cars will increase productivity, and housing affordability, as well as reclaim land used for parking.[209] However, self-driving cars will cause greater energy use, traffic congestion and sprawl.[209] Automated cars could reduce labor costs;[210][211] relieve travelers from driving and navigation chores, thereby replacing behind-the-wheel commuting hours with more time for leisure or work;[198][201] and also would lift constraints on occupant ability to drive, distracted and texting while driving, intoxicated, prone to seizures, or otherwise impaired.[212][213][214]\n\nFor the young, the elderly, people with disabilities, and low-income citizens, automated cars could provide enhanced mobility.[215][216] The removal of the steering wheel\xe2\x80\x94along with the remaining driver interface and the requirement for any occupant to assume a forward-facing position\xe2\x80\x94would give the interior of the cabin greater ergonomic flexibility. Large vehicles, such as motorhomes, would attain appreciably enhanced ease of use.[217]\n\nThe elderly and persons with disabilities (such as persons who are hearing-impaired, vision-impaired, mobility-impaired, or cognitively-impaired) are potential beneficiaries of adoption of autonomous vehicles; however, the extent to which such populations gain greater mobility from the adoption of AV technology depends on the specific designs and regulations adopted.[218][219]\n\nChildren and teens, who are not able to drive a vehicle themselves in case of student transport, would also benefit of the introduction of autonomous cars.[220] Daycares and schools are able to come up with automated pick-up and drop-off systems by car in addition to walking, cycling and busing, causing a decrease of reliance on parents and childcare workers.\n\nThe extent to which human actions are necessary for driving will vanish. Since current vehicles require human actions to some extent, the driving school industry will not be disrupted until the majority of autonomous transportation is switched to the emerged dominant design. It is plausible that in the distant future driving a vehicle will be considered as a luxury, which implies that the structure of the industry is based on new entrants and a new market.[221] Self-driving cars would also exasperate existing mobility inequalities driven by the interests of car companies and technology companies while taking investment away from more equitable and sustainable mobility initiatives such as public transportation.[222]\n\nUrban planning [ edit ]\n\nAccording to a Wonkblog reporter, if fully automated cars become commercially available, they have the potential to be a disruptive innovation with major implications for society. The likelihood of widespread adoption is still unclear, but if they are used on a wide scale, policymakers face a number of unresolved questions about their effects.[118]\n\nOne fundamental question is about their effect on travel behavior. Some people believe that they will increase car ownership and car use because it will become easier to use them and they will ultimately be more useful.[118] This may, in turn, encourage urban sprawl and ultimately total private vehicle use. Others argue that it will be easier to share cars and that this will thus discourage outright ownership and decrease total usage, and make cars more efficient forms of transportation in relation to the present situation.[99][223]\n\nPolicy-makers will have to take a new look at how infrastructure is to be built and how money will be allotted to build for automated vehicles. The need for traffic signals could potentially be reduced with the adoption of smart highways.[224] Due to smart highways and with the assistance of smart technological advances implemented by policy change, the dependence on oil imports may be reduced because of less time being spent on the road by individual cars which could have an effect on policy regarding energy.[225] On the other hand, automated vehicles could increase the overall number of cars on the road which could lead to a greater dependence on oil imports if smart systems are not enough to curtail the impact of more vehicles.[226] However, due to the uncertainty of the future of automated vehicles, policymakers may want to plan effectively by implementing infrastructure improvements that can be beneficial to both human drivers and automated vehicles.[227] Caution needs to be taken in acknowledgment to public transportation and that the use may be greatly reduced if automated vehicles are catered to through policy reform of infrastructure with this resulting in job loss and increased unemployment.[228]\n\nOther disruptive effects will come from the use of automated vehicles to carry goods. Self-driving vans have the potential to make home deliveries significantly cheaper, transforming retail commerce and possibly making hypermarkets and supermarkets redundant. As of 2019 the US Department of Transportation defines automation into six levels, starting at level zero which means the human driver does everything and ending with level five, the automated system performs all the driving tasks. Also under the current law, manufacturers bear all the responsibility to self-certify vehicles for use on public roads. This means that currently as long as the vehicle is compliant within the regulatory framework, there are no specific federal legal barriers in the US to a highly automated vehicle being offered for sale. Iyad Rahwan, an associate professor in the MIT Media Lab said, ""Most people want to live in a world where cars will minimize casualties, but everyone wants their own car to protect them at all costs."" Furthermore, industry standards and best practice are still needed in systems before they can be considered reasonably safe under real-world conditions.[229]\n\nTraffic [ edit ]\n\nAdditional advantages could include higher speed limits;[230] smoother rides;[231] and increased roadway capacity; and minimized traffic congestion, due to decreased need for safety gaps and higher speeds.[232][233] Currently, maximum controlled-access highway throughput or capacity according to the US Highway Capacity Manual is about 2,200 passenger vehicles per hour per lane, with about 5% of the available road space is taken up by cars. One study estimated that automated cars could increase capacity by 273% (\xe2\x89\x888,200 cars per hour per lane). The study also estimated that with 100% connected vehicles using vehicle-to-vehicle communication, capacity could reach 12,000 passenger vehicles per hour (up 545% from 2,200 pc/h per lane) traveling safely at 120 km/h (75 mph) with a following gap of about 6 m (20 ft) of each other. Human drivers at highway speeds keep between 40 to 50 m (130 to 160 ft) away from the vehicle in front. These increases in highway capacity could have a significant impact in traffic congestion, particularly in urban areas, and even effectively end highway congestion in some places.[234] The ability for authorities to manage traffic flow would increase, given the extra data and driving behavior predictability[235] combined with less need for traffic police and even road signage.\n\nInsurance [ edit ]\n\nSafer driving is expected to reduce the costs of vehicle insurance.[210][236][failed verification] The automobile insurance industry might suffer as the technology makes certain aspects of these occupations obsolete.[216] As fewer collisions implicate less money spent on repair costs, the role of the insurance industry is likely to be altered as well. It can be expected that the increased safety of transport due to autonomous vehicles will lead to a decrease in payouts for the insurers, which is positive for the industry, but fewer payouts may imply a demand drop for insurances in general.\n\nIn order to accommodate such changes, the Automated and Electric Vehicles Act 2018 was introduced. While Part 2 deals with Electric Vehicles, Part 1 covers insurance provisions for automated vehicles.\n\nLabor market [ edit ]\n\nA direct impact of widespread adoption of automated vehicles is the loss of driving-related jobs in the road transport industry.[1][210][211][237] There could be resistance from professional drivers and unions who are threatened by job losses.[238] In addition, there could be job losses in public transit services and crash repair shops. A frequently cited paper by Michael Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey found that automated cars would make many jobs redundant.[239] The industry has, however created thousands of jobs in low-income countries for workers who train autonomous systems.[240]\n\nEnergy and environmental impacts [ edit ]\n\nVehicle use\n\nA review found that private autonomous vehicles may increase total travel, whereas autonomous buses may lead to reduced car use.[241]\n\nVehicle automation can improve fuel economy of the car by optimizing the drive cycle, as well as increasing congested traffic speeds by an estimated 8%-13%.[242][243] Reduced traffic congestion and the improvements in traffic flow due to widespread use of automated cars will translate into higher fuel efficiency, ranging from a 23%-39% increase, with the potential to further increase.[242][244] Additionally, self-driving cars will be able to accelerate and brake more efficiently, meaning higher fuel economy from reducing wasted energy typically associated with inefficient changes to speed. However, the improvement in vehicle energy efficiency does not necessarily translate to net reduction in energy consumption and positive environmental outcomes.\n\nAlongside the induced demand, there may also be a reduction in the use of more sustainable modes, such as public or active transport. It is expected that convenience of the automated vehicles encourages the consumers to travel more, and this induced demand may partially or fully offset the fuel efficiency improvement brought by automation.[243] Alongside the induced demand, there may also be a reduction in the use of more sustainable modes, such as public or active transport.[245] Overall, the consequences of vehicle automation on global energy demand and emissions are highly uncertain, and heavily depends on the combined effect of changes in consumer behavior, policy intervention, technological progress and vehicle technology.[243]\n\nProduction\n\nBy reducing the labor and other costs of mobility as a service, automated cars could reduce the number of cars that are individually owned, replaced by taxi/pooling and other car-sharing services.[246][247] This would also dramatically reduce the size of the automotive production industry, with corresponding environmental and economic effects.\n\nIndirect effects\n\nThe lack of stressful driving, more productive time during the trip, and the potential savings in travel time and cost could become an incentive to live far away from cities, where housing is cheaper, and work in the city\'s core, thus increasing travel distances and inducing more urban sprawl, raising energy consumption and enlarging the carbon footprint of urban travel.[243][248][249] There is also the risk that traffic congestion might increase, rather than decrease.[243][216] Appropriate public policies and regulations, such as zoning, pricing, and urban design are required to avoid the negative impacts of increased suburbanization and longer distance travel.[216][249]\n\nSince many autonomous vehicles are going to rely on electricity to operate, the demand for lithium batteries increases. Similarly, radar, sensors, lidar, and high-speed internet connectivity require higher auxiliary power from vehicles, which manifests as greater power draw from batteries.[243] The larger battery requirement causes a necessary increase in the supply of these type of batteries for the chemical industry. On the other hand, with the expected increase of battery-powered (autonomous) vehicles, the petroleum industry is expected to undergo a decline in demand. As this implication depends on the adoption rate of autonomous vehicles, it is unsure to what extent this implication will disrupt this particular industry. This transition phase of oil to electricity allows companies to explore whether there are business opportunities for them in the new energy ecosystem. In 2020, Mohan, Sripad, Vaishnav & Viswanathan at Carnegie Mellon University[250] found that the electricity consumption of all the automation technology, including sensors, computation, internet access as well as the increased drag from sensors causes up to a 15% impact on the range of an automated electric vehicle, therefore, implying that the larger battery requirement might not be as large as previously assumed.\n\nA study conducted by AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety found that drivers did not trust self-parking technology, even though the systems outperformed drivers with a backup camera. The study tested self-parking systems in a variety of vehicles (Lincoln MKC, Mercedes-Benz ML400 4Matic, Cadillac CTS-V Sport, BMW i3 and Jeep Cherokee Limited) and found that self-parking cars hit the curb 81% fewer times, used 47% fewer manoeuvres and parked 10% faster than drivers. Yet, only 25% of those surveyed said they would trust this technology.[251]\n\nParking space [ edit ]\n\nManually driven vehicles are reported to be used only 4\xe2\x80\x935% of the time, and being parked and unused for the remaining 95\xe2\x80\x9396% of the time.[252][253] Autonomous taxis could, on the other hand, be used continuously after they have reached their destination. This could dramatically reduce the need for parking space. For example, in Los Angeles a 2015 study found 14% of the land is used for parking alone, equivalent to some 1,702 hectares (4,210 acres).[254][255] This combined with the potential reduced need for road space due to improved traffic flow, could free up large amounts of land in urban areas, which could then be used for parks, recreational areas, buildings, among other uses; making cities more livable. Besides this, privately owned self-driving cars, also capable of self-parking would provide another advantage: the ability to drop off and pick up passengers even in places where parking is prohibited. This would benefit park and ride facilities.[256]\n\nPrivacy [ edit ]\n\nThe vehicles\' increased awareness could aid the police by reporting on illegal passenger behaviour, while possibly enabling other crimes, such as deliberately crashing into another vehicle or a pedestrian.[257] However, this may also lead to much-expanded mass surveillance if there is wide access granted to third parties to the large data sets generated.\n\nPrivacy could be an issue when having the vehicle\'s location and position integrated into an interface that other people have access to.[1][258] Moreover, they require a sensor-based infrastructure that would constitute an all-encompassing surveillance apparatus.[259] This gives the car manufacturers and other companies the data needed to understand the user\'s lifestyle and personal preferences.[260]\n\nTerrorist scenarios [ edit ]\n\nThere is the risk of terrorist attacks by automotive hacking through the sharing of information through V2V (Vehicle to Vehicle) and V2I (Vehicle to Infrastructure) protocols.[261][262][263] Self-driving cars could potentially be loaded with explosives and used as bombs.[264] According to legislation of US lawmakers, autonomous and self-driving vehicles should be equipped with defences against hacking.[265]\n\nTaxis [ edit ]\n\nWith the aforementioned ambiguous user preference regarding the personal ownership of autonomous vehicles, it is possible that the current mobility provider trend will continue as it rises in popularity. Established providers such as Uber and Lyft are already significantly present within the industry, and it is likely that new entrants will enter when business opportunities arise.[266]\n\nCar repair [ edit ]\n\nAs collisions are less likely to occur, and the risk for human errors is reduced significantly, the repair industry will face an enormous reduction of work that has to be done on the reparation of car frames. Meanwhile, as the generated data of the autonomous vehicle is likely to predict when certain replaceable parts are in need of maintenance, car owners and the repair industry will be able to proactively replace a part that will fail soon. This ""Asset Efficiency Service"" would implicate a productivity gain for the automotive repair industry.\n\nRescue, emergency response, and military [ edit ]\n\nThe technique used in autonomous driving also ensures life savings in other industries. The implementation of autonomous vehicles with rescue, emergency response, and military applications has already led to a decrease in deaths.[citation needed] Military personnel use autonomous vehicles to reach dangerous and remote places on earth to deliver fuel, food and general supplies and even rescue people. In addition, a future implication of adopting autonomous vehicles could lead to a reduction in deployed personnel, which will lead to a decrease in injuries, since the technological development allows autonomous vehicles to become more and more autonomous. Another future implication is the reduction of emergency drivers when autonomous vehicles are deployed as fire trucks or ambulances. An advantage could be the use of real-time traffic information and other generated data to determine and execute routes more efficiently than human drivers. The time savings can be invaluable in these situations.[267]\n\nInterior design and entertainment [ edit ]\n\nWith the driver decreasingly focused on operating a vehicle, the interior design and media-entertainment industry will have to reconsider what passengers of autonomous vehicles are doing when they are on the road. Vehicles need to be redesigned, and possibly even be prepared for multipurpose usage. In practice, it will show that travellers have more time for business and/or leisure. In both cases, this gives increasing opportunities for the media-entertainment industry to demand attention. Moreover, the advertisement business is able to provide location-based ads without risking driver safety.[268]\n\nTelecommunication [ edit ]\n\nAll cars can benefit from information and connections, but autonomous cars ""Will be fully capable of operating without C-V2X.""[269] In addition, the earlier mentioned entertainment industry is also highly dependent on this network to be active in this market segment. This implies higher revenues for the telecommunication industry.\n\nHospitality industry and airlines [ edit ]\n\nDriver interactions with the vehicle will be less common within the near future, and in the more distant future, the responsibility will lie entirely with the vehicle. As indicated above, this will have implications for the entertainment- and interior design industry. For roadside restaurants, the implication will be that the need for customers to stop driving and enter the restaurant will vanish, and the autonomous vehicle will have a double function. Moreover, accompanied by the rise of disruptive platforms such as Airbnb that have shaken up the hotel industry, the fast increase of developments within the autonomous vehicle industry might cause another implication for their customer bases. In the more distant future, the implication for motels might be that a decrease in guests will occur, since autonomous vehicles could be redesigned as fully equipped bedrooms. The improvements regarding the interior of the vehicles might additionally have implications for the airline industry. In the case of relatively short-haul flights, waiting times at customs or the gate imply lost time and hassle for customers. With the improved convenience in future car travel, it is possible that customers might go for this option, causing a loss in customer bases for the airline industry.[270]\n\nIncidents [ edit ]\n\nTesla Autopilot [ edit ]\n\nIn mid\xe2\x80\x91October 2015, Tesla Motors rolled out version 7 of their software in the US that included Tesla Autopilot capability.[271] On 9 January 2016, Tesla rolled out version 7.1 as an over-the-air update, adding a new ""summon"" feature that allows cars to retrieve or self-park at parking locations without the driver in the car.[272] As of November 2020 , Tesla\'s automated driving features is currently classified as a Level 2 driver assistance system according to the Society of Automotive Engineers\' (SAE) five levels of vehicle automation.[55] At this level the car can be automated but requires the full attention of the driver, who must be prepared to take control at a moment\'s notice;[273][274][275][276] Autopilot will sometimes fail to detect lane markings and disengage itself while alerting the driver.[277]\n\nOn 20 January 2016, the first of five known fatal crashes of a Tesla with Autopilot occurred in China\'s Hubei province.[278] According to China\'s 163.com news channel, this marked ""China\'s first accidental death due to Tesla\'s automatic driving (system)"". Initially, Tesla pointed out that the vehicle was so badly damaged from the impact that their recorder was not able to conclusively prove that the car had been on Autopilot at the time; however, 163.com pointed out that other factors, such as the car\'s absolute failure to take any evasive actions prior to the high speed crash, and the driver\'s otherwise good driving record, seemed to indicate a strong likelihood that the car was on Autopilot at the time. A similar fatal crash occurred four months later in Florida.[279][280] In 2018, in a subsequent civil suit between the father of the driver killed and Tesla, Tesla did not deny that the car had been on Autopilot at the time of the accident, and sent evidence to the victim\'s father documenting that fact.[281]\n\nThe second known fatal accident involving a vehicle being driven by itself took place in Williston, Florida on 7 May 2016 while a Tesla Model S electric car was engaged in Autopilot mode. The occupant was killed in a crash with an 18-wheel tractor-trailer. On 28 June 2016 the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened a formal investigation into the accident working with the Florida Highway Patrol. According to NHTSA, preliminary reports indicate the crash occurred when the tractor-trailer made a left turn in front of the Tesla at an intersection on a non-controlled access highway, and the car failed to apply the brakes. The car continued to travel after passing under the truck\'s trailer.[282][283] NHTSA\'s preliminary evaluation was opened to examine the design and performance of any automated driving systems in use at the time of the crash, which involved a population of an estimated 25,000 Model S cars.[284] On 8 July 2016, NHTSA requested Tesla Motors provide the agency detailed information about the design, operation and testing of its Autopilot technology. The agency also requested details of all design changes and updates to Autopilot since its introduction, and Tesla\'s planned updates schedule for the next four months.[285]\n\nAccording to Tesla, ""neither autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor-trailer against a brightly lit sky, so the brake was not applied."" The car attempted to drive full speed under the trailer, ""with the bottom of the trailer impacting the windshield of the Model S"". Tesla also claimed that this was Tesla\'s first known autopilot death in over 130 million miles (210 million kilometers) driven by its customers with Autopilot engaged, however by this statement, Tesla was apparently refusing to acknowledge claims that the January 2016 fatality in Hubei China had also been the result of an autopilot system error. According to Tesla there is a fatality every 94 million miles (151 million kilometers) among all type of vehicles in the US[282][283][286] However, this number also includes fatalities of the crashes, for instance, of motorcycle drivers with pedestrians.[287][288]\n\nIn July 2016, the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) opened a formal investigation into the fatal accident while the Autopilot was engaged. The NTSB is an investigative body that has the power to make only policy recommendations. An agency spokesman said ""It\'s worth taking a look and seeing what we can learn from that event, so that as that automation is more widely introduced we can do it in the safest way possible.""[289] In January 2017, the NTSB released the report that concluded Tesla was not at fault; the investigation revealed that for Tesla cars, the crash rate dropped by 40 percent after Autopilot was installed.[290]\n\nWaymo [ edit ]\n\nWaymo originated as a self-driving car project within Google. In August 2012, Google announced that their vehicles had completed over 300,000 automated-driving miles (500,000 km) accident-free, typically involving about a dozen cars on the road at any given time, and that they were starting to test with single drivers instead of in pairs.[291] In late-May 2014, Google revealed a new prototype that had no steering wheel, gas pedal, or brake pedal, and was fully automated .[292] As of March 2016 , Google had test-driven their fleet in automated mode a total of 1,500,000 mi (2,400,000 km).[293] In December 2016, Google Corporation announced that its technology would be spun off to a new company called Waymo, with both Google and Waymo becoming subsidiaries of a new parent company called Alphabet.[294][295]\n\nAccording to Google\'s accident reports as of early 2016, their test cars had been involved in 14 collisions, of which other drivers were at fault 13 times, although in 2016 the car\'s software caused a crash.[296]\n\nIn June 2015, Brin confirmed that 12 vehicles had suffered collisions as of that date. Eight involved rear-end collisions at a stop sign or traffic light, two in which the vehicle was side-swiped by another driver, one in which another driver rolled through a stop sign, and one where a Google employee was controlling the car manually.[297] In July 2015, three Google employees suffered minor injuries when their vehicle was rear-ended by a car whose driver failed to brake at a traffic light. This was the first time that a collision resulted in injuries.[298] On 14 February 2016 a Google vehicle attempted to avoid sandbags blocking its path. During the maneuver it struck a bus. Google stated, ""In this case, we clearly bear some responsibility, because if our car hadn\'t moved, there wouldn\'t have been a collision.""[299][300] Google characterized the crash as a misunderstanding and a learning experience. No injuries were reported in the crash.[296]\n\nUber [ edit ]\n\nIn March 2017, an Uber test vehicle was involved in a crash in Tempe, Arizona when another car failed to yield, flipping the Uber vehicle. There were no injuries in the accident.[301]\n\nBy 22 December 2017, Uber had completed 2 million miles (3.2 million kilometers) in automated mode.[302]\n\nOn 18 March 2018, Elaine Herzberg became the first pedestrian to be killed by a self-driving car in the United States after being hit by an Uber vehicle, also in Tempe. Herzberg was crossing outside of a crosswalk, approximately 400 feet from an intersection.[303] This marks the first time an individual is known to have been killed by an autonomous vehicle.\n\nThe first death of an essentially uninvolved third party is likely to raise new questions and concerns about the safety of automated cars in general.[304] Some experts say a human driver could have avoided the fatal crash.[305] Arizona Governor Doug Ducey later suspended the company\'s ability to test and operate its automated cars on public roadways citing an ""unquestionable failure"" of the expectation that Uber make public safety its top priority.[306] Uber has pulled out of all self-driving-car testing in California as a result of the accident.[307] On 24 May 2018 the US National Transport Safety Board issued a preliminary report.[308]\n\nOn 16 September 2020, according to the BBC, the backup driver has been charged of negligent homicide, because she did not look to the road for several seconds while her television was streaming The Voice broadcast by Hulu. Uber does not face any criminal charge because in the USA there is no basis for criminal liability for the corporation. The driver is assumed to be responsible of the accident, because she was in the driver seat in capacity to avoid an accident (like in a Level 3). Trial is planned for February 2021.[309]\n\nNavya automated bus driving system [ edit ]\n\nOn 9 November 2017, a Navya automated self-driving bus with passengers was involved in a crash with a truck. The truck was found to be at fault of the crash, reversing into the stationary automated bus. The automated bus did not take evasive actions or apply defensive driving techniques such as flashing its headlights, or sounding the horn. As one passenger commented, ""The shuttle didn\'t have the ability to move back. The shuttle just stayed still.""[310]\n\nPublic opinion surveys [ edit ]\n\nIn a 2011 online survey of 2,006 US and UK consumers by Accenture, 49% said they would be comfortable using a ""driverless car"".[311]\n\nA 2012 survey of 17,400 vehicle owners by J.D. Power and Associates found 37% initially said they would be interested in purchasing a ""fully autonomous car"". However, that figure dropped to 20% if told the technology would cost US$3,000 more.[312]\n\nIn a 2012 survey of about 1,000 German drivers by automotive researcher Puls, 22% of the respondents had a positive attitude towards these cars, 10% were undecided, 44% were skeptical and 24% were hostile.[313]\n\nA 2013 survey of 1,500 consumers across 10 countries by Cisco Systems found 57% ""stated they would be likely to ride in a car controlled entirely by technology that does not require a human driver"", with Brazil, India and China the most willing to trust automated technology.[314]\n\nIn a 2014 US telephone survey by Insurance.com, over three-quarters of licensed drivers said they would at least consider buying a self-driving car, rising to 86% if car insurance were cheaper. 31.7% said they would not continue to drive once an automated car was available instead.[315]\n\nIn a February 2015 survey of top auto journalists, 46% predict that either Tesla or Daimler will be the first to the market with a fully autonomous vehicle, while (at 38%) Daimler is predicted to be the most functional, safe, and in-demand autonomous vehicle.[316]\n\nIn 2015 a questionnaire survey by Delft University of Technology explored the opinion of 5,000 people from 109 countries on automated driving. Results showed that respondents, on average, found manual driving the most enjoyable mode of driving. 22% of the respondents did not want to spend any money for a fully automated driving system. Respondents were found to be most concerned about software hacking/misuse, and were also concerned about legal issues and safety. Finally, respondents from more developed countries (in terms of lower accident statistics, higher education, and higher income) were less comfortable with their vehicle transmitting data.[317] The survey also gave results on potential consumer opinion on interest of purchasing an automated car, stating that 37% of surveyed current owners were either ""definitely"" or ""probably"" interested in purchasing an automated car.[317]\n\nIn 2016, a survey in Germany examined the opinion of 1,603 people, who were representative in terms of age, gender, and education for the German population, towards partially, highly, and fully automated cars. Results showed that men and women differ in their willingness to use them. Men felt less anxiety and more joy towards automated cars, whereas women showed the exact opposite. The gender difference towards anxiety was especially pronounced between young men and women but decreased with participants\' age.[318]\n\nIn 2016, a PwC survey, in the United States, showing the opinion of 1,584 people, highlights that ""66 percent of respondents said they think autonomous cars are probably smarter than the average human driver"". People are still worried about safety and mostly the fact of having the car hacked. Nevertheless, only 13% of the interviewees see no advantages in this new kind of cars.[319]\n\nIn 2017, Pew Research Center surveyed 4,135 US adults from 1\xe2\x80\x9315 May and found that many Americans anticipate significant impacts from various automation technologies in the course of their lifetimes\xe2\x80\x94from the widespread adoption of automated vehicles to the replacement of entire job categories with robot workers.[320]\n\nIn 2019, results from two opinion surveys of 54 and 187 US adults respectively were published. A new standardised questionnaire, the autonomous vehicle acceptance model (AVAM) was developed, including additional description to help respondents better understand the implications of different automation levels. Results showed that users were less accepting of high autonomy levels and displayed significantly lower intention to use highly autonomous vehicles. Additionally, partial autonomy (regardless of level) was perceived as requiring uniformly higher driver engagement (usage of hands, feet and eyes) than full autonomy.[321]\n\nRegulation [ edit ]\n\nThe Geneva Convention on Road Traffic subscribed to by over 101 countries worldwide, requires the driver to be 18 years old.\n\nThe 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, subscribed to by over 70 countries worldwide, establishes principles to govern traffic laws. One of the fundamental principles of the convention has been the concept that a driver is always fully in control and responsible for the behavior of a vehicle in traffic.[322] In 2016, a reform of the convention has open possibilities for automated features. The progress of technology that assists and takes over the functions of the driver is undermining this principle, implying that much of the groundwork must be rewritten.[citation needed]\n\nThis means that in those countries cars might be automated or autonomous or self-driving but not driver-less.\n\nLegislation in Japan [ edit ]\n\nIn 2019, Japan amended two laws, ""Road Traffic Act"" and ""Road Transport Vehicle Act"",[323] and they came into effect in April 2020. In the former act, Level 3 self driving cars became allowed on public roads.[324] In the latter act, process to designate types for safety certification on Level 3 self driving function of Autonomous Driving System (ADS) and the certification process for the asserted type were legally defined.[325] Through the amendment process, the achievements from the national project ""SIP-adus"" led by Cabinet Office since 2014 were fully considered and accepted.[326]\n\nIn 2020, the next stage national level roadmap plan was officially issued which had considered social deployment and acceptability of Level 4.[327][328]\n\nIn 2021, National Police Agency published its committee report of FY 2020 on summary of issues in research to realize Level 4 mobility services, including required legal amendment issues.[329][330]\n\nLegal status in the United States [ edit ]\n\nUS states that allow testing of autonomous vehicles on public roads as of June 2018\n\nIn the United States, a non-signatory country to the Vienna Convention, state vehicle codes generally do not envisage\xe2\x80\x94but do not necessarily prohibit\xe2\x80\x94highly automated vehicles as of 2012 .[331][332] To clarify the legal status of and otherwise regulate such vehicles, several states have enacted or are considering specific laws.[333] By 2016, seven states (Nevada, California, Florida, Michigan, Hawaii, Washington, and Tennessee), along with the District of Columbia, have enacted laws for automated vehicles. Incidents such as the first fatal accident by Tesla\'s Autopilot system have led to discussion about revising laws and standards for automated cars.\n\nFederal policies [ edit ]\n\nIn September 2016, the US National Economic Council and US Department of Transportation (USDOT) released the Federal Automated Vehicles Policy,[334] which are standards that describe how automated vehicles should react if their technology fails, how to protect passenger privacy, and how riders should be protected in the event of an accident. The new federal guidelines are meant to avoid a patchwork of state laws, while avoiding being so overbearing as to stifle innovation.[335] Since then, USDOT has released multiple updates:\n\nAutomated Driving Systems: A Vision for Safety 2.0 (12 September 2017) [336]\n\n(12 September 2017) Preparing for the Future of Transportation: Automated Vehicles 3.0 (4 October 2018) [337]\n\n(4 October 2018) Ensuring American Leadership in Automated Vehicle Technologies: Automated Vehicles 4.0 (8 January 2020)[338]\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration released for public comment the Occupant Protection for Automated Driving System on 30 March 2020,[339] followed by the Framework for Automated Driving System Safety on 3 December 2020.[340] Occupant Protection is intended to modernize the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards considering the removal of manual controls with automated driving systems,[341] while the Framework document is intended to provide an objective way to define and assess automated driving system competence to ensure motor vehicle safety while also remaining flexible to accommodate the development of features to improve safety.[342]\n\nState policies [ edit ]\n\nNevada\n\nIn June 2011, the Nevada Legislature passed a law to authorize the use of automated cars. Nevada thus became the first jurisdiction in the world where automated vehicles might be legally operated on public roads. According to the law, the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles is responsible for setting safety and performance standards and the agency is responsible for designating areas where automated cars may be tested.[343][344][345] This legislation was supported by Google in an effort to legally conduct further testing of its Google driverles'";"Autonomous Cars";"301.txt-Autonomous Cars"
"303.txt";"b'The dream of the self-driving car \xe2\x80\x94 you get in, program your destination, ease the seat back, and let the car take you where you need to go. Read a book. Maybe take a nap or play a game on the in-car entertainment screen. Regardless, you will not need to watch the road. The car will get you there and back safely.\n\nAre we there yet? If not, when will we be?\n\nAutomation and autonomous driving are complex subjects. What engineers can safely deliver doesn\xe2\x80\x99t always match what marketers want to sell.\n\nThis guide will walk you through what you need to know about automotive autopilot, self-driving technology, and driver aids today and tomorrow.\n\nWhat is a Self-Driving Car?\n\nWhen discussing automotive assistance systems\xe2\x80\x99 terminology, no one agrees on what to call anything in this field. From engineering jargon to marketing speak, the lingo continues to evolve.\n\nRoughly speaking, you can sort the technologies people might refer to as self-driving into two categories \xe2\x80\x94 driver support and automation systems. Read on to see how they differ.\n\nDriver Support\n\nDriver support technology reduces the workload on the driver. Today, most automakers sell various driver support systems, either as standard equipment or as options on their cars. These include intelligent or adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assists, and hands-free capability.\n\nAutonomous Systems\n\nAutonomous systems do the driving for you. No automaker today sells a true autonomous system, but some are pushing toward that technology. One such project underway is Waymo, a sister company to Google, that is testing autonomous rideshare vehicles in Phoenix using converted Chrysler Pacifica minivans.\n\nRELATED STORIES: Report: Apple Self-Driving Car Coming by 2024\n\nSix Levels of Self-Driving Technology\n\nSAE International, a global association of engineers and related technical experts in the aerospace, automotive, and commercial-vehicle industries, has laid out a useful framework for thinking about self-driving systems. They sort the technologies into six levels, labeled zero through five (okay, even automotive engineers don\xe2\x80\x99t always do the logical thing).\n\nHowever, not every level is classified as autonomous driving. According to SAE, levels zero through two are considered driver support features, while levels three through five are classified as having autonomous capability.\n\nLevel 0\n\nAt Level 0, the car reacts only to the driver\xe2\x80\x99s input. Even if it uses sensors to warn you of surrounding traffic, like a blind-spot alert system or a lane-departure warning, it still has no self-driving capability to correct or counter the perceived threat.\n\nLevel 1\n\nAt Level 1, your car can intervene slightly in your driving in an attempt to keep you safe. A lane-keeping system that helps steer to center you in a lane is a Level 1 technology.\n\nRELATED STORIES: What is Adaptive Cruise Control?\n\nLevel 2\n\nAt Level 2, features communicate with one another, and more than one can be active simultaneously. An example of this autonomous technology is an adaptive cruise control system that adjusts your speed to keep you a certain distance from the car ahead while centering the car in its lane.\n\nCurrently, Level 2 systems are the most sophisticated technology sold on cars in America. Some automakers describe these systems in ways that make them seem more advanced than Level 2 standards because they allow drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel briefly. However, all these systems require drivers to keep their eyes focused ahead. Drivers need to be ready at all times to take over control of the car at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice.\n\nLevel 3\n\nAt Level 3, the car can drive itself under limited conditions, but the driver must remain aware and prepared to take over. Automakers have tested Level 3 systems that will allow the driver to take their hands off the wheel in a traffic jam, for instance, but prompt the driver to take over when the congestion eases.\n\nAccording to Honda and a few other reputable sites, the Honda 100 Legend Flagship car is the first Level 3 autonomous car. Right now, it\xe2\x80\x99s only available in Japan for leasing. It was released on March 5, 2021.\n\nThere are no Level 3 systems currently sold to consumers in the U.S.\n\nLevel 4\n\nAt Level 4, the car can drive itself in a fixed loop on known roads. The rider is not required to take over driving at any time. These vehicles may or may not have a steering wheel or pedals. In some places, Level 4 driverless rideshare vehicles (like Waymo\xe2\x80\x99s) are in limited testing. But they are not yet approved for general use in any state.\n\nLevel 5\n\nAt Level 5, the car can drive itself under any conditions and on any road. These vehicles do not have steering wheels or pedals. At this point, Level 5 systems are theoretical.\n\nCan You Trust It?\n\nAll self-driving systems currently for sale in the United States are SAE Level 2 or lower. It is not safe to remove your attention from driving while behind the wheel of any car currently sold with this technology. However, it is safe to briefly remove your hands from the wheel with some Level 2 systems under certain conditions. But you should remain prepared to take over the driving at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice.\n\nTesla advertises its automation systems more aggressively than any other U.S. automaker. Still, its advertising materials flatly state, \xe2\x80\x9cAutopilot and Full Self-Driving Capability are intended for use with a fully attentive driver, who has their hands on the wheel and is prepared to take over at any moment. While these features are designed to become more capable over time, the currently enabled features do not make the vehicle autonomous.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDo You Still Need to Pay Attention to the Road?\n\nYes. Always. Even when using driving assist technology in Levels 0 to 3, it\xe2\x80\x99s required that you always keep your eyes on the road.\n\nHowever, when using low-speed applications, including self-parking features, keeping your eyes on the road or staying inside the vehicle may not be needed. For example, some luxury brands offer a self-parking remote that handles this maneuver for things like parallel parking.\n\nWhich Cars Have Self-Driving Capability?\n\nVirtually every automaker selling cars in the U.S. today offers driver-assistance systems that can reduce the workload on the driver. These include adaptive cruise control that can adjust speed to maintain distance from the car ahead or automatic emergency braking that can slow or stop the car to avoid hitting a vehicle or pedestrian or reduce the severity of a crash.\n\nNone of these systems are so reliable that the driver can take their attention from the task of driving, though.\n\nMany manufacturers currently market systems up to and including Level 2 automation. This approach combines adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assist into a system that requires that the driver keep their hands on the wheel but relieves some of the driver\xe2\x80\x99s workload.\n\nA prime example is cruise control with stop-and-go capability that allows the driver to negotiate heavy traffic without using the pedals.\n\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s a breakdown of what to expect from several of them.\n\nNissan ProPILOT\n\nNissan markets this as ProPILOT, \xe2\x80\x9ca hands-on driver-assist system that combines Nissan\xe2\x80\x99s Intelligent Cruise Control and Steering Assist technologies and includes a stop and hold function that can bring the vehicle to a full stop, hold in place, and can bring you back up to speed when traffic starts moving again.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNewer versions use the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s navigation system information to slow for curves ahead and prompt the driver to adjust for posted speed limits. While it will keep the car centered in its lane, it will not steer the car through curves like Kia\xe2\x80\x99s, Ford\xe2\x80\x99s, GM\xe2\x80\x99s, or Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s systems.\n\nSubaru EyeSight\n\nSubaru\xe2\x80\x99s EyeSight system does much the same. It also has a pre-collision braking system that alerts the driver to an impending crash and applies full braking power to try to prevent it.\n\nVolvo Pilot Assist\n\nVolvo\xe2\x80\x99s Pilot Assist allows the driver to set a preferred speed and preferred distance from the vehicle ahead. It can then change speed to maintain that distance and keep the car centered in its lane. But Pilot Assist will warn the driver audibly and shut itself off if the road starts to curve or if it detects that the driver has removed their hands from the wheel.\n\nMercedes-Benz Distronic Plus with Steering Assist\n\nMercedes-Benz\xe2\x80\x99s Distronic Plus with Steering Assist also combines adaptive cruise control with a lane-centering system. In keeping with Mercedes\xe2\x80\x99 autobahn image, it functions at up to 120 mph and warns drivers if they are about to be passed.\n\nAnother feature, called Parktronic, allows drivers to follow the car\xe2\x80\x99s commands under 20 mph as it self-parks the vehicle. The driver keeps control of the car with the gas and brake pedals. The driver just needs to put the car in drive or reverse as it drives and steers itself into a parking space.\n\nTesla Autopilot and Full Self-Driving\n\nTesla markets its evolving suite of self-driving technologies more aggressively than any other automaker. This has led to some confusion as to what level of automation Tesla cars are currently capable of. The electric car company sells the systems under two names: Autopilot, and Full Self-Driving.\n\nEvery Tesla vehicle available in 2021 ships with the company\xe2\x80\x99s Autopilot system enabled. Autopilot is a traffic-aware cruise control system that accelerates and slows the car to match the speed of the cars around it, combined with a lane-keeping assist system that centers the car in a clearly marked lane. That\xe2\x80\x99s all it is. The marketing name \xe2\x80\x9cAutopilot\xe2\x80\x9d may make it sound considerably more advanced. But it is similar to adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assist systems offered by most automakers, like Nissan\xe2\x80\x99s ProPILOT or Subaru\xe2\x80\x99s EyeSight.\n\nOlder Teslas use torque sensors in the steering wheel to monitor the driver\xe2\x80\x99s attention level and promptly alert them if their attention seems to be waning. Newer models use a more accurate camera for the same purpose.\n\nFull Self-Driving\n\nTesla\xe2\x80\x99s Full Self-Driving is considerably more sophisticated. Despite its name, it does not possess SAE Level 5 self-driving capability. Full Self-Driving can park the car in a parking space, back it out of a parking space, and change lanes on its own at highway speeds. A more advanced system in beta testing can slow the car for stop signs and traffic lights and navigate highway on-ramps and off-ramps. Tesla regularly sends updates to this system remotely to cars currently involved in the beta test.\n\nCrucially, Full Self-Driving does not allow the driver to take their attention from the road. They may temporarily take their hands from the wheel but should be prepared to take over driving at any moment. Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s own marketing materials caution, \xe2\x80\x9cThe currently enabled Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFull Self-Driving is a costly option, even by luxury car standards. As of this writing, the Tesla self-driving price for the feature adds $10,000 to the total cost. Tesla promises to update it regularly in hopes of eventually releasing an SAE Level 5 autonomous driving system to everyone who has purchased Full Self-Driving.\n\nHowever, in a recent letter to California state regulators, Tesla said that Full Self-Driving would remain at Level 2. The company said it did \xe2\x80\x9cnot expect significant enhancements\xe2\x80\x9d that would \xe2\x80\x9cshift the responsibility for the entire dynamic driving task to the system.\xe2\x80\x9d Instead, the letter said, Full Self-Driving \xe2\x80\x9cwill continue to be an SAE Level 2, advanced driver assistance feature.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nConsumers should be aware that the company has told shoppers it will someday have Level 5 capability and has told government regulators that it would not.\n\nCheck out our YouTube videos on the Tesla Model Y and Tesla Model S\n\nGeneral Motors Super Cruise\n\nGeneral Motors offers its own advanced driver assistance system, an SAE Level 2 system called Super Cruise. Like Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s Autopilot, Super Cruise includes an adaptive cruise control that will speed up and slow down the vehicle to maintain a driver-selected distance from the vehicle ahead. It also has a lane-keeping system that tries to center the car in its lane even through curves in the road, and automatic emergency braking that brakes the car in an attempt to avert a collision.\n\nSuper Cruise requires the driver to stay alert and keep their hands near the wheel. It includes a driver monitoring system that watches the driver\xe2\x80\x99s eyes and warns them if their attention seems to be drifting from the road. GM says, \xe2\x80\x9cSuper Cruise allows the driver to drive hands-free when compatible road driving conditions allow the feature to be available. But the driver still needs to pay close attention to the road. Even while using the Super Cruise driver assistance technology, drivers should always pay attention while driving and not use a hand-held device.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSuper Cruise is currently available on most Cadillac vehicles and the Chevy Bolt and Bolt EUV electric vehicles. GM plans to extend it to parts of the Buick and GMC lineup in 2022. Super Cruise is free for the first three years but requires a subscription after that.\n\nOf note, Super Cruise works only on roads mapped by GM. The company mapped at least 200,000 miles of roads in the U.S. and Canada using lidar mapping technology.\n\nFord Blue Cruise\n\nFord and its Lincoln luxury division recently introduced their own Level 2 automation system, called Blue Cruise. Buyers can order Blue Cruise on many new Ford and Lincoln vehicles today. But the system isn\xe2\x80\x99t active yet. Ford expects to activate it late in 2021 through an over-the-air software update that will not require a visit to the dealership.\n\nLike Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s Autopilot and GM\xe2\x80\x99s Super Cruise systems, Blue Cruise pairs an adaptive cruise control with lane-keeping assistance. It allows drivers to temporarily remove their hands from the wheel while keeping their eyes on the road.\n\nBlue Cruise automatically steers the vehicle using more than 100,000 miles of pre-mapped roads stored in the system. In Blue Cruise-equipped cars, the driver\xe2\x80\x99s instrument cluster switches to a blue background when driving on a road where the system can be activated.\n\nA subscription to Blue Cruise costs $600 for three years. However, to use it, you must buy an option package that has all the necessary equipment. The cost range is $995 to $2,600, depending on the model.\n\nTraffic Jam Assists\n\nLuxury automakers have begun developing semi-autonomous driving systems specifically for use in heavy traffic. They allow the driver to relax their attention and let the car accelerate and brake to keep its place in traffic, but systems work only at lower speeds.\n\nBMW\xe2\x80\x99s Active Driving Assistant Pro, for instance, shuts off when traffic exceeds 40 mph. It will not steer the vehicle through curves.\n\nAudi is developing its own Traffic Jam Pilot that, it says, should allow drivers to remove their hands from the wheel below 37 mph. But that system has not received regulatory approval.\n\nThe Future of Self-Driving Cars\n\nEngineers from more than a dozen companies are testing self-driving systems in hopes of producing an SAE Level 5 self-driving car. It seems safe to predict that the technology is coming.\n\nBut the engineering challenge of getting there is immense. A car that can drive itself on well-maintained roads may make a critical mistake on poorly maintained roads. What if a car that can react safely to normal traffic may not react safely to unusual situations? A car that can do everything engineers ask of it may fail when presented with a problem they never considered (in one recent incident, a self-driving car in testing was baffled by a truck bed full of traffic signs being delivered to a construction site. The car had no idea what to do).\n\nBeyond the engineering challenge, 50 sets of state laws (plus the District of Columbia) must adapt to decide safety and liability issues before self-driving cars can become common.\n\nThe market will also have its say. Volkswagen recently unveiled a concept car that would charge by the mile for self-driving capability. Executives reasoned that as long as getting your car to drive you somewhere costs less than a train ticket to that same place, they could charge for using the self-driving feature. So, while some automakers hope to charge buyers upfront for automation, others may make it available for short-term rental only.\n\nLastly, there\xe2\x80\x99s the matter of marketing. It\xe2\x80\x99s already growing difficult to sort what manufacturers claim their cars can do from what they can actually do. That will only grow cloudier as the technology advances.\n\nSo, while you may be able to own a self-driving car in your lifetime, it may be further away than advancing technology would indicate.\n\nMore: Best Cars and Top 10 Lists\n\nRelated Self-Driving Stories:'";"Autonomous Cars";"303.txt-Autonomous Cars"

"306.txt";"b'Who wouldn\'t want to just press a button, have the steering wheel and pedals stowed, and let your self-driving car whisk you in cocooned comfort to your parent\'s house five hours away while you sleep, work, or play with your kids? That\'s a dream scenario self-driving cars promise. Proponents say there would be no more crashes, no more drunk driving, no more traffic. It\'s tantalizing to think that cars will one day be able to drive us. It can also be terrifying to others who fear letting go of the wheel of control.\n\nSelf-driving cars are already here, in a sense. There are limited trials of vehicles running with no drivers along predetermined, hyper-limited routes in the U.S. and other countries, operated by their makers and technology companies. But the day when millions of self-driving cars ply the world\'s roads is still a long way out. But how far? We take a look at some of the most common questions surrounding self-driving cars and when you might no longer be behind the wheel.\n\nHow Much Does a Self-Driving Car Cost?\n\nAccording to former Waymo CEO John Krafcik, in an interview with German publication Manager Magazin, a Jaguar I-Pace equipped with Waymo\'s sensors and computers costs no more than a moderately equipped Mercedes-Benz S-Class. So likely in the $130,000-$150,000 ballpark. Of course, these costs will come down as the technologies used to power self-driving cars (cameras, radar systems, sensors, advanced automotive computers) drop as the costs to make them become more affordable at scale and they advance enough to be relied upon in all circumstances and conditions. Using Waymo\'s lidar as an example, its engineering team was able to build a version that costs 90 percent less than what used to be $75,000 a unit.\n\nSee all 3 photos See all 3 photos\n\nWhat Are These Automated Driving Levels I Keep Hearing About?\n\nThe Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) has classified six levels of automation. Level 0, Level 1, and Level 2 systems require a human to be actively driving and monitoring the vehicle and the driving environment at all times; think lane-keep assist or active cruise-control systems as seen on current vehicles. But Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 are where automated systems start to take control and when ""self-driving"" enters the picture. Level 3 is in essence a bridge level where the system can drive the car for a period of time, but the driver must still be ready to re-engage with the system at a moment\'s notice. Level 4 and 5 are where the car essentially drives you, with Level 4 still having a few limited scenarios where the driver may need to take over. Level 5 means never having any control of the vehicle whatsoever.\n\nCan I Buy a Self-Driving Car Now?\n\nNo. No vehicles available for sale in the U.S. today are self-driving. Cars equipped with Tesla Autopilot, Ford BlueCruise, and GM SuperCruise are NOT self-driving. They may appear to be self-driving, given that you can drive without your hands on the steering wheel for a predetermined length of time, but they are not reliable or capable enough to be true self-driving. Those systems are classified as Level 2 capable, where the driver can briefly cede driving responsibilities but must be alert and always ready to take over. In effect, the driver is still in charge of the operation of the vehicle, no matter what the system is capable of performing.\n\nSee all 3 photos See all 3 photos\n\nWhen Can I Buy a Self-Driving Car in the Future?\n\nAt this point, self-driving cars are more of a future technology like what you might see in Black Mirror (a near future science fiction TV drama). The tech seems highly plausible, but we are not there yet in reality. We are at a point where we may see Level 3 self-driving cars in the next five years, but they would only work in very limited conditions. Chances are, you may be able to ride in a self-driving taxi without a driver before seeing a self-driving car for sale on a dealer lot. There are still many problems to tackle before Level 4 or 5 autonomous cars can become a real thing. In the meantime, companies will sell some intermediate products to fund their self-driving development. For example, Tesla\'s Full Self-Driving (FSD) system. In theory, a Tesla with FSD has the hardware to ""self-drive,"" but development is not there yet. What Tesla is selling now is a Level 2 driving assist system for real and self-driving as a promise.\n\nWhat Are the Advantages of Self-Driving Cars?\n\nSafety is a major benefit of self-driving cars. The prevailing wisdom is that self-driving systems will drastically reduce or even remove human error on the road, which will reduce crashes to virtually zero. Humans can get tired and distracted, something machines and algorithms will never be. Computers are also able to strictly follow rules and cooperate with one another, so along with a reduced number of crashes, self-driving cars can help smooth out traffic flow and reduce traffic jams. They can also solve the headache of looking for a parking spot by self-parking by themselves. For people who cannot drive (age, disability, or any other reason), automated vehicles can provide them with new personal mobility options.\n\nWhat are Disadvantages of Self-Driving Cars?\n\nIn today\'s stage, the self-drive working condition is very limited. Honda\'s Traffic Jam Pilot can only self-drive under 30 mph (Audi\'s under 37 mph), and Level 4 Waymo vehicles can only operate within a confined zone when weather permits. High cost will also remain a disadvantage until the technology becomes mainstream. Then there\'s the question of how infallible all of the computing power and technology necessary to power self-driving cars will be. Personal computers freeze all the time. What happens when a car\'s computer brain freezes?\n\nCan You Sleep in a Self-Driving Car?\n\nIn a true Level 4 or 5 automated vehicle, yes, you could sleep, but at that point, you\'re basically a passenger, much like riding in a taxi. But in a Level 3 car you\'ll need to remain awake because whenever self-driving conditions are not met, the system needs a human driver to take control. And NO, DO NOT sleep in a Tesla on Autopilot. It is not a self-driving car, even if you bought the Full Self-Driving option.\n\nWhat Technologies Are Essential for Self-Driving Cars?\n\nDriving is a complicated task, so there are many technologies involved. To name a few: ultra-high-resolution cameras with high-dynamic-range sensors to see in various light conditions, ultrasonic sensors to detect objects around the car, light-emitting radar (lidar) to detect faraway objects, ultra-fast computer chips to process the large influx of data pouring in by the millisecond (not to mention storage of said data), and sophisticated software to do the driving. You also need high-speed internet connections to move data to and from the car, to and from other cars, and to and from any infrastructure. One major tech development that will help speed up self-driving car development is machine learning.

"315.txt";"b""When it comes to self-driving cars, the future was supposed to be now.\n\nIn 2020, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be a \xe2\x80\x9cpermanent backseat driver,\xe2\x80\x9d the Guardian predicted in 2015. \xe2\x80\x9c10 million self-driving cars will be on the road by 2020,\xe2\x80\x9d blared a Business Insider headline from 2016. Those declarations were accompanied by announcements from General Motors, Google\xe2\x80\x99s Waymo, Toyota, and Honda that they\xe2\x80\x99d be making self-driving cars by 2020. Elon Musk forecast that Tesla would do it by 2018 \xe2\x80\x94 and then, when that failed, by 2020.\n\nBut the year is here \xe2\x80\x94 and the self-driving cars aren\xe2\x80\x99t.\n\nDespite extraordinary efforts from many of the leading names in tech and in automaking, fully autonomous cars are still out of reach except in special trial programs. You can buy a car that will automatically brake for you when it anticipates a collision, or one that helps keep you in your lane, or even a Tesla Model S (which \xe2\x80\x94 disclosure \xe2\x80\x94 my partner and I own) whose Autopilot mostly handles highway driving.\n\nBut almost every one of the above predictions has been rolled back as the engineering teams at those companies struggle to make self-driving cars work properly.\n\nWhat happened? Here are nine questions you might have had about this long-promised technology, and why the future we were promised still hasn\xe2\x80\x99t arrived.\n\n1) How exactly do self-driving cars work?\n\nEngineers have been attempting prototypes of self-driving cars for decades. The idea behind it is really simple: Outfit a car with cameras that can track all the objects around it and have the car react if it\xe2\x80\x99s about to steer into one. Teach in-car computers the rules of the road and set them loose to navigate to their own destination.\n\nThis simple description elides a whole lot of complexity. Driving is one of the more complicated activities humans routinely do. Following a list of rules of the road isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough to drive as well as a human does, because we do things like make eye contact with others to confirm who has the right of way, react to weather conditions, and otherwise make judgment calls that are difficult to encode in hard-and-fast rules.\n\nAnd even the simple parts of driving \xe2\x80\x94 like tracking the objects around a car on the road \xe2\x80\x94 are actually much trickier than they sound. Take Google\xe2\x80\x99s sister company Waymo, the industry leader in self-driving cars. Waymo\xe2\x80\x99s cars, which are fairly typical of other self-driving cars, use high-resolution cameras and lidar (light detection and ranging), a way of estimating distances to objects by bouncing light and sound off things.\n\nThe car\xe2\x80\x99s computers combine all of this to build a picture of where other cars, cyclists, pedestrians, and obstacles are and where they\xe2\x80\x99re moving. For this part, lots of training data is needed \xe2\x80\x94 that is, the car has to draw on millions of miles of driving data that Waymo has collected to form expectations about how other objects might move. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to get enough training data on the road, so the cars also train based on simulation data \xe2\x80\x94 but engineers have to be sure that their AI systems will generalize correctly from the simulation data to the real world.\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s far from a complete description of the systems at work when a self-driving car is on the road. But it illustrates an important principle to keep in mind when wondering where our self-driving cars are: Even the \xe2\x80\x9ceasy\xe2\x80\x9d things turn out to hide surprising complexity.\n\n2) Why is it taking longer than expected to get self-driving cars on the road?\n\nSelf-driving cars rely on artificial intelligence to work. And the 2010s were a great decade for AI. We saw big advances in translation, speech generation, computer vision and object recognition, and game-playing. AI used to have a hard time identifying dogs in pictures; now that\xe2\x80\x99s a trivial task.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s this progress in AI that drove the optimistic predictions for self-driving cars in the mid-2010s. Researchers anticipated that we could build on the amazing gains they\xe2\x80\x99d seen (and are still seeing) in other arenas.\n\nBut when it came to self-driving cars, the limitations of those gains became very apparent. Even with extraordinary amounts of time, money, and effort invested, no team could figure out how to have AI solve a real-world problem: navigating our roads with the high degree of reliability needed.\n\nMuch of the problem is the need for lots of training data. The ideal way to train a self-driving car would be to show it billions of hours of footage of real driving, and use that to teach the computer good driving behavior. Modern machine learning systems do really well when they have abundant data, and very poorly when they have only a little bit of it. But collecting data for self-driving cars is expensive. And since some events are rare \xe2\x80\x94 witnessing a car accident ahead, say, or encountering debris on the road \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s possible for the car to be out of its depth because it has encountered a situation so infrequently in its training data.\n\nCarmakers have tried to get around this in lots of ways. They\xe2\x80\x99ve driven more miles. They\xe2\x80\x99ve trained the cars in simulations. They sometimes engineer specific situations so that they can get more training data about those situations for the cars.\n\nAnd they are getting closer. Waymo cars do roam the streets of Arizona with no one behind the wheel (a small pool of specially screened people can call them up like they would an Uber). If all goes well, they may expand to more cities later this year (more on this below). But it\xe2\x80\x99s a hard problem, and progress has been slow.\n\n3) What does a world with self-driving cars look like?\n\nCompanies continue to invest despite the setbacks because self-driving cars, when they happen, will change a lot for the world \xe2\x80\x94 and make their creators lots of money.\n\nMany consumers will want to upgrade. Imagine being able to read or doze off during your morning drive to work or on long car trips. It also seems likely that taxi and ride-hailing companies will offer self-driving cars, rather than paying drivers (in fact, companies like Uber are betting on it). Self-driving cars should also make a huge difference for Americans with disabilities, many of whom can\xe2\x80\x99t get a driver\xe2\x80\x99s license and have trouble getting to work, the store, and doctor\xe2\x80\x99s appointments.\n\nExperts disagree on whether self-driving cars will change anything fundamental about car ownership in America. Some argue that people won\xe2\x80\x99t need to own a car if they can order one on their phone and get a timely robot ride anywhere.\n\nOthers have pointed out that people generally still own a car even in areas with good ride-share coverage and that self-driving cars might not be any different. Polls suggest that most Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be driven to work by a self-driving car \xe2\x80\x94 but that might change fast once such cars actually exist. Gallup polling on this question found a small share (9 percent) of Americans who\xe2\x80\x99d get such a car right away, with a larger contingent (38 percent) saying they\xe2\x80\x99d wait a while, and half holding steadfast that they\xe2\x80\x99d never use one.\n\nOver time, our infrastructure will likely change to make it easier for self-driving cars to navigate, and in fact, some researchers have argued that we won\xe2\x80\x99t have widespread self-driving cars until we\xe2\x80\x99ve made major changes to our streets to make it easier to communicate information to those cars. That would be expensive and require nationwide coordination, so it seems likely that it would follow the widespread introduction of self-driving cars rather than precede it.\n\n4) What are the leading self-driving car programs, and what are they doing?\n\nAlmost every major car manufacturer has at least tested the waters with self-driving car research. But some are much more serious about it than others.\n\nThere are two core statistics useful for evaluating how advanced a self-driving car program is. One is how many miles it has driven. That\xe2\x80\x99s a proxy for how much training data the company has, and how much investment it has poured into getting its cars on the road.\n\nThe other is disengagements \xe2\x80\x94 moments when a human driver has to take over because the computer couldn\xe2\x80\x99t handle a situation \xe2\x80\x94 per mile driven. Most companies don\xe2\x80\x99t share these statistics, but the state of California requires that they be reported, and so California\xe2\x80\x99s statistics are the best peek into how various companies are doing.\n\nOn both fronts, Google\xe2\x80\x99s sister company Waymo is the clear leader. Waymo just announced 20 million miles driven overall, most of those not in California. In 2018, Waymo drove 1.2 million miles in California, with 0.09 disengagements every 1,000 miles. Coming in second is General Motors\xe2\x80\x99 Cruise, with about half a million miles and 0.19 disengagements per 1,000 miles. (Cruise argues that since it tests its cars on San Francisco\xe2\x80\x99s difficult streets, these numbers are even more impressive than they look.)\n\nThose two companies are well ahead of everyone else in both miles driven and disengagements in the state of California. While that\xe2\x80\x99s only a limited snapshot of their efforts, most experts consider them the leading programs in general.\n\n5) Didn\xe2\x80\x99t a self-driving car kill a woman? How did that happen? And what are the safety issues involved with self-driving cars?\n\nMarch 18, 2018, was the first time a self-driving car ran down a pedestrian. An Uber car with a safety driver behind the wheel hit and killed Elaine Herzberg, a 49-year-old woman walking her bicycle across the street in Tempe, Arizona.\n\nThe incident was a reminder that self-driving car technology still had a long way to go. Some people were quick to point out that humans frequently kill other humans while driving, and that even if self-driving cars are much safer than humans, there will be some fatal incidents with self-driving cars. That\xe2\x80\x99s true as far as it goes. But it misses a key point. Human driving produces one fatal accident in every 100 million miles driven. Waymo, the leader in miles driven, just reached 20 million miles driven. It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had a fatal accident yet, but given the number of miles its cars have driven, it\xe2\x80\x99s simply far too soon to prove that they\xe2\x80\x99re as safe as or safer than a human driver.\n\nUber hasn\xe2\x80\x99t driven nearly as many miles and has had a fatal incident. The company doesn\xe2\x80\x99t release specific figures, but its filings for its IPO last year said that it had driven \xe2\x80\x9cmillions\xe2\x80\x9d of miles. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to tell without specific numbers, but it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to wonder if Uber\xe2\x80\x99s driving record is much worse than a human\xe2\x80\x99s.\n\nFurthermore, a review of Herzberg\xe2\x80\x99s death suggests that a lot of preventable mistakes were made. The accident report by the National Transportation Safety Board, released in December 2019, found that the near-range cameras and the ultrasonic sensors \xe2\x80\x9cwere not in use at the time of the crash.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAdditionally, the system was having such a problem with false alarms \xe2\x80\x94 detecting dangerous situations when none existed \xe2\x80\x94 that it had been programmed with \xe2\x80\x9ca one-second period during which the ADS [automated driving system] suppresses planned braking while the (1) system verifies the nature of the detected hazard and calculates an alternative path, or (2) vehicle operator takes control of the vehicle,\xe2\x80\x9d according to the NTSB report. So even when the car detected the hazard, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t brake \xe2\x80\x94 which could have made the collision avoidable or much less deadly \xe2\x80\x94 but instead continued with exactly what it was doing for a full second.\n\nThe system was designed to assume that pedestrians would never cross except at a crosswalk, so when one did cross without using one, it failed to identify her. Even worse, when the system was unclear on whether an object was a bicycle (as it was with Herzberg), it was unable to retain any information about how the object was moving. The system sensed her presence six full seconds before the impact \xe2\x80\x94 and yet did nothing (except possibly braking in the last two-tenths of a second) before colliding with her at deadly speed.\n\nThose are avoidable failures.\n\nUber pulled its cars off the road in response, returning to self-driving car trials a year later with a drastically changed program. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve implemented key safety improvements from both safety reviews, shared our learnings with the larger self-driving industry, and accepted the NTSB\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation to implement a Safety Management System, which is underway today,\xe2\x80\x9d Nat Beuse, Uber\xe2\x80\x99s self-driving cars head of safety, told Vox in a statement in response to a request for comment. \xe2\x80\x9cAs we look ahead to the future, we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to keep safety at the center of every decision we make.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNonetheless, deadly accidents with self-driving cars will keep happening \xe2\x80\x94 and it\xe2\x80\x99s not just Uber. A report from the National Transportation Safety Board implicated Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s Autopilot system in another lethal 2018 accident; while the driver had his hands off the wheel, the car steered into a concrete divider and crashed, killing him. A full investigation hasn\xe2\x80\x99t yet been conducted on three more recent deadly Tesla crashes. The problem, according to NTSB chairman Robert Sumwalt, is that drivers assume Autopilot lets them take their attention off the road, when they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. That won\xe2\x80\x99t be a problem with fully autonomous vehicles, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a potentially major one now.\n\nAs I\xe2\x80\x99ve written before, getting good self-driving cars on the road can save hundreds of thousands of lives. But it takes a lot of engineering work to get the cars good enough to be lifesaving.\n\n6) Are self-driving cars going to be good for the environment?\n\nSome advocates have argued that self-driving cars will be good for the environment. They claim they might reduce car trips by making car ownership unnecessary and transitioning society to a model where most people don\xe2\x80\x99t own a car and just call for one when they need one.\n\nIn addition, others have argued that human drivers drive in a wasteful way \xe2\x80\x94 braking hard, accelerating hard, idling the engine, all of which use up fuel \xe2\x80\x94 which a computer could avoid.\n\nBut as self-driving cars have inched closer to reality, most of these claimed benefits have started to look less likely.\n\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s not much evidence that computers are dramatically more fuel-efficient drivers than humans. There\xe2\x80\x99s one small study suggesting adaptive cruise control improves efficiency a little (5 to 7 percent), but there\xe2\x80\x99s little else beyond that. Furthermore, researchers have examined the effects of more fuel-efficient cars on miles traveled and found that, under many circumstances, people drive more when cars get more fuel-efficient \xe2\x80\x94 so self-driving cars having higher fuel efficiency might not mean that they produce lower emissions.\n\nOne study attempting to estimate the effects of self-driving cars on car use behavior simulated a family having a self-driving car by paying for them to have a chauffeur for a week, and telling them to treat the chauffeur service the way they\xe2\x80\x99d treat having a car that could drive itself.\n\nThe result? They went on a lot more car trips.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s still possible that some big transition to a lower-driving world will happen. A study of one week of driving habits isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough to settle the question for sure. The researchers who conducted that study are preparing future studies, and it\xe2\x80\x99s possible those comparisons will turn up more encouraging results.\n\n7) So if they\xe2\x80\x99re not necessarily safer and they\xe2\x80\x99re not necessarily greener, why are we even doing this?\n\nThe above few sections might inspire some pessimism, but there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of reason to be excited about self-driving cars. They will likely make life easier for older people and those with disabilities who cannot safely drive. They might provide better, safer, and cheaper options for people currently forced to own a car to get anywhere. Additional research and development will make them safer \xe2\x80\x94 and once the kinks are worked out, there is a likelihood that self-driving cars will be safer than human-driven ones.\n\nIn a sense, we\xe2\x80\x99re in an awkward transition moment where we want self-driving cars they aren\xe2\x80\x99t yet an uncomplicated positive.\n\nResearch and development is proceeding anyway, mostly because self-driving cars will probably be a gold mine for the first company to get them on the road. They\xe2\x80\x99ll likely be able to establish themselves in ride-hailing, taxi, and trucking markets while competitors are still struggling to catch up, and then they\xe2\x80\x99ll benefit from the additional miles traveled to further improve their cars.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not uncommon for a technology to be dangerous and barely worth it when it is first invented, only to eventually be refined into a valuable part of modern life. The first airplanes were dangerous and commercially useless, but we improved things dramatically from there.\n\n8) What role does policy play in the development of self-driving cars?\n\nThere is no federal law regarding self-driving cars. Much of the action on policy has largely taken place at the state level. And the laws surrounding self-driving cars vary enormously by state, with 29 states having passed legislation.\n\nSelf-driving car development mostly happens in the states that have been friendliest to it \xe2\x80\x94 especially California and Arizona \xe2\x80\x94 and it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to envision some states banning self-driving cars long after they become commonplace in other states, especially if the safety case for them isn\xe2\x80\x99t a slam-dunk.\n\nWhen self-driving cars were first proposed, I heard a lot of worries that regulators would unnecessarily delay their implementation. By 2016, it was obvious that hadn\xe2\x80\x99t come to pass. Indeed, in some cases regulators may have been too permissive \xe2\x80\x94 for example, in light of Uber pulling its cars and instituting new safety procedures, it seems the vehicle that killed Elaine Herzberg probably shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been on the road at all.\n\nPolicy might also shape whether self-driving cars are good or bad for the environment. With high taxes on gasoline, for example, the social costs of carbon emissions could be reflected in the price of using self-driving cars \xe2\x80\x94 and the money can be spent on climate adaptation and clean energy. But right now, our transportation policy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do much of anything about the social costs of driving, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a problem that will only get worse if self-driving cars put more people on the road.\n\n9) So just when are we getting self-driving cars?\n\nIn some senses, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been \xe2\x80\x9cclose\xe2\x80\x9d on self-driving cars for years now. Waymo is doing test runs with no one behind the wheel in Arizona, which it\xe2\x80\x99s been doing since 2017. Cruise delayed the 2019 launch of its autonomous taxi service but thinks it might happen in 2020. Earlier this year, the company unveiled a car with no steering wheel ... and no timetable for when it\xe2\x80\x99ll be available for sale. Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s periodic software updates make its Autopilot highway self-driving work better, but it remains well short of full self-driving.\n\nThere are certainly skeptics. Recently, the CEO of Volkswagen said that fully self-driving cars might \xe2\x80\x9cnever happen.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThat might be an overly harsh forecast, considering the progress that\xe2\x80\x99s been made. But it is exasperatingly difficult to get a good estimate of how long until self-driving cars happen for real for the typical American, both because no one knows for sure and because companies have incentives to publicize optimistic estimates. The companies boast about their progress but don\xe2\x80\x99t publish their mishaps. Timelines slip, and the change in plans is often publicly acknowledged only long after it\xe2\x80\x99s become obvious that the deadline can\xe2\x80\x99t be met.\n\nAt the same time, companies hesitate to put their cars on the road when there\xe2\x80\x99s any chance they aren\xe2\x80\x99t ready. They are well aware that killing someone, as Uber did, is not only horrible but also probably spells doom for their business. So there\xe2\x80\x99s ample incentive to say optimistic things and not actually launch.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not hard to imagine their arrival later this year, at least in sufficiently limited contexts; it\xe2\x80\x99s also not hard to imagine that the deadlines will be pushed out another three or four years.\n\nSelf-driving cars are on their way. They\xe2\x80\x99re closer than they were a year ago.

"316.txt";"b'It was seven years ago when Waymo discovered that spring blossoms made its self-driving cars get twitchy on the brakes. So did soap bubbles. And road flares.\n\nNew tests, in years of tests, revealed more and more distractions for the driverless cars. Their road skills improved, but matching the competence of human drivers was elusive. The cluttered roads of America, it turned out, were a daunting place for a robot.\n\nThe wizards of Silicon Valley said people would be commuting to work in self-driving cars by now. Instead, there have been court fights, injuries and deaths, and tens of billions of dollars spent on a frustratingly fickle technology that some researchers say is still years from becoming the industry\xe2\x80\x99s next big thing.\n\nNow the pursuit of autonomous cars is undergoing a reset. Companies like Uber and Lyft, worried about blowing through their cash in pursuit of autonomous technology, have tapped out. Only the deepest-pocketed outfits like Waymo, which is a subsidiary of Google\xe2\x80\x99s parent company, Alphabet; auto giants; and a handful of start-ups are managing to stay in the game.'";"Autonomous Cars";"316.txt-Autonomous Cars"
"317.txt";"b'What are the challenges with autonomous cars?\n\nFully autonomous (Level 5) cars are undergoing testing in several pockets of the world, but none are yet available to the general public. We\xe2\x80\x99re still years away from that. The challenges range from the technological and legislative to the environmental and philosophical. Here are just some of the unknowns.\n\nLidar and Radar\n\nLidar is expensive and is still trying to strike the right balance between range and resolution. If multiple autonomous cars were to drive on the same road, would their lidar signals interfere with one another? And if multiple radio frequencies are available, will the frequency range be enough to support mass production of autonomous cars?\n\nWeather Conditions\n\nWhat happens when an autonomous car drives in heavy precipitation? If there\xe2\x80\x99s a layer of snow on the road, lane dividers disappear. How will the cameras and sensors track lane markings if the markings are obscured by water, oil, ice, or debris?\n\nTraffic Conditions and Laws\n\nWill autonomous cars have trouble in tunnels or on bridges? How will they do in bumper-to-bumper traffic? Will autonomous cars be relegated to a specific lane? Will they be granted carpool lane access? And what about the fleet of legacy cars still sharing the roadways for the next 20 or 30 years?\n\nState vs. Federal Regulation\n\nThe regulatory process in the U.S. has recently shifted from federal guidance to state-by-state mandates for autonomous cars. Some states have even proposed a per-mile tax on autonomous vehicles to prevent the rise of \xe2\x80\x9czombie cars\xe2\x80\x9d driving around without passengers. Lawmakers have also written bills proposing that all autonomous cars must be zero-emission vehicles and have a panic button installed. But are the laws going to be different from state to state? Will you be able to cross state lines with an autonomous car?\n\nAccident Liability\n\nWho is liable for accidents caused by an autonomous car? The manufacturer? The human passenger? The latest blueprints suggest that a fully autonomous Level 5 car will not have a dashboard or a steering wheel, so a human passenger would not even have the option to take control of the vehicle in an emergency.\n\nArtificial vs. Emotional Intelligence\n\nHuman drivers rely on subtle cues and non-verbal communication\xe2\x80\x94like making eye contact with pedestrians or reading the facial expressions and body language of other drivers\xe2\x80\x94to make split-second judgment calls and predict behaviors. Will autonomous cars be able to replicate this connection? Will they have the same life-saving instincts as human drivers?'";"Autonomous Cars";"317.txt-Autonomous Cars"
"318.txt";"b""Imagine getting into your car, typing\xe2\x80\x94or, better yet speaking\xe2\x80\x94a location into your vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s interface, then letting it drive you to your destination while you read a book, surf the web, or nap. Self-driving vehicles\xe2\x80\x94the stuff of science fiction since the first roads were paved\xe2\x80\x94are coming, and they\xe2\x80\x99re going to radically change what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to get from point A to point B.\n\nIn 2009, Google started the self-driving car project with the goal of driving autonomously over ten uninterrupted 100-mile routes. In 2016, Waymo, an autonomous driving technology company, became a subsidiary of Alphabet, and Google's self-driving project became Waymo.\n\nSince then, Waymo has invited the public to join the first public trial of autonomous vehicles operated by the Waymo Driver and introduced its first fully autonomous vehicles operated by the Waymo Driver on public roads without anyone in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat.\n\nKey Takeaways The hype around driverless cars has grown rapidly over the past several years, with many big technology companies getting behind the concept.\n\nGoogle launched its Waymo division to develop and market consumer-ready driverless vehicles around the globe.\n\nThe company, along with several others in the tech and auto industries, is betting that driverless cars will soon change the way we get around in a major way.\n\nAmong the revolutionary changes will be safer roads, fewer fossil fuels, and lower transportation costs.\n\nBasic Technology Already In Use\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe building blocks of driverless cars are on the road now,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Russ Rader, senior vice president of communications at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf. He pointed to the front-crash prevention systems that for several years have been able to warn drivers of an impending obstacle and apply the brakes if they don\xe2\x80\x99t react fast enough.\n\nThese systems were quickly followed by technology that allows cars to self-park by sizing up a free spot and automatically steering into it, with the driver only controlling the accelerator and brake pedals. Mercedes-Benz took autonomous driving even further when they introduced Drive Pilot, which allows the driver to hand over direct control of steering and speed in certain circumstances, while still supervising the overall operation of the car.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nIn 2018, Waymo announced that they would be making self-driving cars available by 2020. However, despite some extraordinary advancements, in the year 2020, self-driving cars are still out of reach, except in some trial programs.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf The current technology on the market is limited to cars that will automatically brake for you if they anticipate a collision, cars that help keep you in your lane, and cars that can mostly handle highway driving.\n\nThe idea behind self-driving cars is fairly simple: build a car with cameras that can track all the objects around it. The car should react if it\xe2\x80\x99s about to steer into one. And once in-car computers know all driving rules, they should be able to navigate to their destination. In the end, you might say that the execution of these ideas has been more complicated than was anticipated.\n\nWaymo's cars, the leader in self-driving technology, use high-resolution cameras and lidar (light detection and ranging, which is a way of estimating the distance to another object by bouncing light and sound off things). This technology helps the self-driving car identify where other cars, cyclists, pedestrians, and obstacles are and where they\xe2\x80\x99re moving.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nA Drastic Change\n\nWith the adoption of any new revolutionary technology, it is predicted there will be problems for businesses that don\xe2\x80\x99t adjust fast enough to future developments in self-driving car technology. Futurists estimate that hundreds of billions of dollars (if not trillions) will be lost by automakers, suppliers, dealers, insurers, parking companies, and many other car-related enterprises. And think of the lost revenue for governments via licensing fees, taxes and tolls, and by personal injury lawyers and health insurers.\n\nWho needs a car made with heavier-gauge steel and eight airbags (not to mention a body shop) if accidents are so rare? Who needs a parking spot close to work if your car can drive you there, park itself miles away, only to pick you up later? Who needs to buy a flight from Boston to Cleveland when you can leave in the evening, sleep much of the way, and arrive in the morning?\n\nIndeed, one of Google\xe2\x80\x99s goals is to facilitate car-sharing.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf That means fewer cars on the road. Fewer cars, period. Who needs to own a car when you can just order a shared one and it\xe2\x80\x99ll drive up minutes later, ready to take you wherever you want?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis [has the potential to] dramatically reduce the number of cars on the street, 80% of which have people driving alone in them, and also a household's cost of transportation, which is 18% of their income\xe2\x80\x94around $9,000 a year\xe2\x80\x94for an asset that they use only 5% of the time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Robin Chase, the founder and CEO of Buzzcar, a peer-to-peer car-sharing service, and co-founder and former CEO of Zipcar.\n\nIn 2030, self-driving cars are expected to create $87 billion worth of opportunities for automakers and technology developers, said a report by Boston-based Lux Research.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf Software developers stand to win big.\n\nA Manufacturing Revolution\n\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re an automaker, such as Ford Motor Co. (F), General Motors Co. (GM), Chrysler Group LLC, Toyota Motor Corp. or Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (HMC), which account for almost 70% of the U.S. market, you could see an initial surge in the $600 billion in annual new and used car sales globally.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf \xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf But as soon as the technology takes hold, sales could fall off significantly as sharing popularizes.\n\nCars will always need steel, glass, an interior, a drivetrain, and some form of human interface (even if that interface is little more than a wireless connection to your smartphone). But much of everything else could change. As an example, take front-facing seats; they could become an option, not a requirement. Automakers that see the changes coming\xe2\x80\x94such as how the big profits are secured downstream by car servicers, insurers, and more\xe2\x80\x94are focusing on services as much as on what and how they manufacture.\n\nInfrastructure Transformation\n\nWith fewer cars around, parking lots and spaces that cover roughly one-third of the land area of many U.S. cities can be repurposed. That could mean temporary downward pressure on real estate values as supply increases. It could also mean greener urban areas and revitalized suburbs if longer commutes become more palatable. And if fewer cars are on the road, federal, state, and local government agencies may be able to reallocate a good portion of the roughly $180 billion spent annually on highways and roads.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nChanging Oil Demand\n\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re in the business of finding, extracting, refining, and marketing hydrocarbons, such as Exxon Mobil (EOX), Chevron (CVX), or BP (BP), you could see your business fluctuate as use changes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese vehicles should practice very efficient eco-driving practices, which is typically about 20% better than the average driver,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chase. \xe2\x80\x9cOn the other hand, if these cars are owned by individuals, I see a huge rise in the number of trips, and vehicle miles traveled. People will send out their car to run errands they would never do if they had to be in the car and waste their own time. If the autonomous cars are shared vehicles and people pay for each trip, I think this will reduce demand, and thus (vehicle miles traveled).\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSafety Dividend\n\nAutonomous vehicles are also expected to be safer. \xe2\x80\x9cThese cars won't get drunk or high, drive too fast, or take unnecessary risks\xe2\x80\x94things people do all the time,\xe2\x80\x9d Chase said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOver 90% of accidents today are caused by driver error,\xe2\x80\x9d said Professor Robert W. Peterson of the Center for Insurance Law and Regulation at Santa Clara University School of Law. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is every reason to believe that self-driving cars will reduce the frequency and severity of accidents, so insurance costs should fall, perhaps dramatically.\xe2\x80\x9d\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCars can still get flooded, damaged, or stolen,\xe2\x80\x9d notes Michael Barry, vice president of media relations at the Insurance Information Institute. \xe2\x80\x9cBut this technology will have a dramatic impact on underwriting. A lot of traditional underwriting criteria will be upended.\xe2\x80\x9d\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nBarry said it\xe2\x80\x99s too early to quantify exactly how self-driving vehicles will affect rates, but added that injured parties in a crash involving a self-driving car may choose to sue the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s manufacturer or the software company that designed the autonomous capability.\n\nInitially, insurers such as State Farm Insurance, Allstate Corp. (ALL), Liberty Mutual Group, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\xe2\x80\x99s (BRK-A) GEICO, Citigroup Inc.\xe2\x80\x99s (C) Travelers Group could see a huge benefit from lower accident liabilities. But they may wind up losing a big portion of the $200 billion in personal auto premiums they write every year as fewer cars take to the road.\n\nSome experts have even speculated that mandatory insurance for cars could be dropped. And as long as we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about financial services, what about the multitude of banks and creditors that lend buyers money in about 85% of car purchases if sales volume falls?\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nAccording to a University of Texas report, if only 10% of the cars on U.S. roads were autonomous, almost $30 billion of savings could be realized via less wasted time and fuel, as well as fewer injuries and deaths. At 90%, the benefit rises to almost $120 billion a year.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nCloser to Home\n\nSelf-driving cars could have a substantial impact on the taxi and limousine industries and could potentially create new ones. Chase noted that they could be used to share specific trips, as a kind of pay-as-you-go small-scale public transportation\xe2\x80\x94for example, taking a disparate bunch of Manhattanites to the same beach in the Hamptons in one trip.\n\nOne study found that a fleet of 9,000 driverless taxis could serve all of Manhattan at about $0.50 per mile (compared to about $5 per mile now). At the time the study was published, there were licenses for over 13,000 taxis in New York City.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nSelf-driving cars may also challenge train lines. \xe2\x80\x9cA self-driving car offers much of the convenience of rail service with the added convenience that the service is portal-to-portal rather than station-to-station,\xe2\x80\x9d Peterson said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the other hand, a fleet of self-driving cars available at the station may make rail service more palatable. \xe2\x80\x9cThe technology has already been adopted in closed systems, such as campuses, air-terminals, and mining,\xe2\x80\x9d he noted. \xe2\x80\x9cRio Tinto Group (RIO), a large mining company, uses enormous self-driving trucks in its mining operations. European countries are experimenting with the platooning of trucks. Among other things, this saves about 18% in fuel.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRisks and Hurdles\n\nThere are regulatory and legislative obstacles to the widespread use of self-driving cars and substantial concerns about privacy. (Who will have access to any driving information these vehicles store?) There\xe2\x80\x99s also the question of security, as hackers could theoretically take control of these vehicles, and are not known for their restraint or civic-mindedness.\n\nThe Future of Waymo\n\nIn March 2020, Waymo Via, the trucking division of Waymo, was launched. According to Google, since 2017 Waymo Driver had been learning to drive large Class 8 trucks in the same way that it had learned how to drive passenger vehicles. Waymo is currently testing its fleet of trucks in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, and has launched a pilot program for local delivery in the Phoenix, Arizona area.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nWaymo has partnerships with multiple vehicle manufacturers to integrate its technology. In October 2020, Waymo and Daimler Trucks partnered to create an autonomous version of the Freightliner Cascadia truck. This is Waymo's first foray into the freight industry. Daimler's trucks will be equipped with autonomous technology that allows them to drive without a human but only in pre-defined areas.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nGoogle\xe2\x80\x99s Self-Driving Car FAQs\n\nIs Google Making a Car?\n\nGoogle has made it clear that it has no plans to build cars itself. Waymo is a self-driving technology company; it does not intend to manufacture and sell its own line of vehicles.\n\nWhat Year Will There Be Self-Driving Cars?\n\nEarly estimates about self-driving cars being the norm by 2020 have turned into having a few research vehicles on the road by 2020. Even if the technology is not developing as fast as expected, computer-processing capabilities and sophisticated artificial intelligence systems are becoming more advanced and more affordable every year. It's not clear when all the pieces will truly fall into place to allow for driverless technologies to safely navigate public roads among traditional cars. While experts agree that there will be a time in the future when this is true, they disagree on the timeline.\n\nHow Much Does the Google Car Cost?\n\nGoogle does not manufacture or sell its own cars. However, you can purchase a semi-autonomous Honda Civic that comes with advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) that control the steering, lane changing, acceleration, and braking while the car is cruising on the highway. You can also purchase a Tesla Motors vehicle that comes equipped with its semi-autonomous Autopilot feature.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nHowever it plays out, these vehicles are coming\xe2\x80\x94and fast. Their full adoption will take decades, but their convenience, cost, safety, and other factors will make them ubiquitous and indispensable. Such as with any technological revolution, the companies that plan ahead, adjust the fastest, and imagine the biggest will survive and thrive. And companies invested in old technology and practices will need to evolve or risk dying.""";"Autonomous Cars";"318.txt-Autonomous Cars"
"319.txt";"b'Artificial intelligence (AI) is used in a wide variety of products and services, including maps embedded on our smart phones and \xe2\x80\x9cchat bots\xe2\x80\x9d that help answer our questions on websites. Many hope that AI will transform our economy in ways that drive growth, similar to how steam engines did in the late 19th century and electricity did in the early 20th century. But it is hard to imagine that maps on smart phones, chatbots, and other existing AI-enabled services will drive the type of economic growth we saw from stream and electricity. What we need to see are some dramatic new AI-enabled products and services that transform our way of life\xe2\x80\x94in short, we are waiting for an AI \xe2\x80\x9ckiller app.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRobert Seamans Associate Professor and Director of the Center for the Future of Management - Stern School of Business, NYU\n\nAutonomous vehicles (AVs)\xe2\x80\x94vehicles that accelerate, brake, and turn on their own, requiring little or no input from a human driver\xe2\x80\x94may be such a killer app that transforms our economy significantly. AI supports AVs in a variety of ways, including quickly processing and interpreting the large amounts of data generated by the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s cameras and sensors and helping to improve vehicle fuel efficiency and safety. The impacts of broad adoption of AVs are equally numerous, from potentially lowering transportation costs by limiting the need for drivers to possibly transforming mobility in urban and suburban environments. While the relative timing and scale of economic growth is not yet clear\xe2\x80\x94and subject to some debate among scholars\xe2\x80\x94a key step in maximizing the benefits of AVs is passing federal legislation, rather than relying on a patchwork of state and local guidelines. To inform the debate and help prepare policymakers for the task at hand, this report will examine the state of AVs, the potential for them to become a \xe2\x80\x9ckiller app\xe2\x80\x9d with broad impacts, and the existing and potential regulations that could ensure net positive effects on the economy and society as a whole.\n\nThe current state and future of AVs\n\nThe current standards for autonomous driving were developed by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE International). According to the SAE standard, the automation capability of vehicles ranges from Level 0, with no autonomy, to Level 5, which is full automation. Level 1 features include park assist, lane assist and adaptive cruise control. Some Level 3 vehicles, which include full self-driving capabilities but require human intervention in complex situations such as traffic jams, may be commercially available in 2021. No Level 4 or 5 cars, which would not require any human intervention, are yet certified for use on regular roads, though there are some such as Google\xe2\x80\x99s Waymo that are in development.\n\nWhile the potential impacts of AVs are substantial, it will take time for them to be realized; AVs are still some years from being commercially available, let alone in widespread use. To give a reasonable sense of timing, Chris Urmson\xe2\x80\x94a DARPA challenge winner, head of Google\xe2\x80\x99s Waymo autonomous vehicle unit for many years, and now CEO of a self-driving vehicle software company named Aurora \xe2\x80\x94argues it may take up to 30 to 50 years before widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles. Despite predictions to the contrary\xe2\x80\x94e.g., Elon Musk\xe2\x80\x99s 2019 prediction that there would be a Tesla driverless taxi fleet in some regions by 2020\xe2\x80\x94time frames of this magnitude are common in the automobile industry. Choe, Oettl and Seamans (2021) report that widespread adoption of new innovations in the automobile sector historically can take several decades.1 There are a number of factors that contribute to technology adoption, and even if a new technology is feasible, it may not be available at a price point that many consumers will pay. For example, turbo-charged engines, which help to reduce the amount of fuel needed, did not start to become popular until oil prices started to rise in the 1970s.\n\nIn short, the timing of adoption of AVs and the economic impacts that will follow depend on many factors. For regulators and policymakers interested in shaping what will likely be considerable economic and societal impacts of AVs, now is the time.\n\nEffect on our economy and society\n\nSupporters of autonomous vehicles argue that they may provide a variety of benefits including fuel efficiency and safety. Indeed, the Brookings Institution recently published a book on the topic (Winston and Karpilow, 2020).2 The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) argues that AVs are more fuel efficient than human-driven cars, which means fewer emissions. However, AVs may increase vehicle traffic, potentially nullifying emissions reduction from fuel efficiency. Kroger, Kuhnimhof, and Trommer (2019) project the adoption of autonomous vehicle technologies may increase vehicle traffic by 2-9 percent as a result of new automobile user groups as well as lower generalized costs of car travel.3\n\nAVs will likely be safer than human-driven cars, in large part through reducing human error which the National Highway Traffic Safety Association (NHTSA) estimates accounts for 94 percent of crashes. While widespread adoption of AVs should ultimately result in safer roads, there have been several high profile accidents involving AVs, such as a Waymo van that crashed into a car in Arizona. Perhaps as a result of some of these high-profile accidents, consumer demand for AVs seems to be relatively low. According to a 2021 survey by the American Automobile Association, only 14 percent of drivers report that they would trust riding in a vehicle that drives itself, a response similar to the 2020 survey. It is possible, however, that consumer attitudes will change once Level 4 and 5 vehicles become commercially available.\n\nAVs may help to reduce labor input costs in driving-intensive industries. However, as Gittleman and Monaco (2017) point out, there are several types of drivers, and autonomous driving will likely affect some types more than others.4 Autonomous vehicles are more likely to be used for heavy and tractor trailer truck purposes (aka \xe2\x80\x9clong haul\xe2\x80\x9d) than local delivery given the relative ease of navigating on highways and all the other tasks associated with local delivery, including freight handling, paperwork, and customer service. Gittleman and Monaco estimate that Level 4 and 5 automation may ultimately displace 300,000 to 400,000 drivers. But the authors highlight that there are many practical limitations to automation. For example, they highlight that one of the important functions of a truck driver is to serve as a security guard for the freight.\n\nA recent paper by Gelauff, Ossokina, and Teulings (2019) envisions some of the longer-term outcomes from AVs.5 The authors model two countervailing effects from AVs, each of which lead to differing outcomes on population distribution. On one hand, AVs may lead to improved use of time during car trips, which lowers the cost of living at a distance from cities. On the other hand, AVs may lead to improved public transit options in urban environments in the form of shared-ride autonomous vehicles (SAVs). The authors argue that SAVs may be more efficient than existing public transit and may make city living relatively more attractive leading to more population clustering in cities. The authors argue that the second effect may outweigh the first and ultimately may lead to overall population shifts towards large, attractive cities at the expense of smaller urban and non-urban areas. While the authors don\xe2\x80\x99t speculate on the ultimate economic effects of such a change, it is worth noting that literature from economic geography suggests that there are many agglomeration effects from living in or close to cities, including greater economic growth and innovation.6 It is also worth noting that the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a large shift in population away from many urban environments, at least in the short run.\n\nIn short, AVs will likely affect our economy and society in a variety of ways. AVs may lead to fewer emissions and increased safety. By decreasing the need for humans to drive, AVs will likely transform the type of work done by humans in the transportation sector of the economy and may also change the way that humans commute to and from work. How all this plays out, however, depends on numerous factors including, importantly, existing and future regulations.\n\nCurrent and prospective AV legislation\n\nThe National Conference of State Legislatures highlights that a number of states have introduced and enacted laws related to autonomous vehicles. Notably, in December 2020, California State Senator Ben Allen introduced a bill to establish a new Council on the Future of Transportation in California that would promote state legislation for autonomous vehicles, in addition to other transportation-related policy. Also, in November 2020 the California Public Utilities Commission approved autonomous vehicle regulatory framework that would make it easier for companies to provide autonomous vehicle transportation services to the public. While these laws indicate that state legislators are responsive to local concerns about autonomous vehicles, the risk is a resulting patchwork of state laws.\n\nWith this concern in mind, there have been attempts at federal legislation, notably in 2017 with the SELF DRIVE Act in the House and the AV START Act in the Senate. The SELF DRIVE Act (Safely Ensuring Lives Future Deployment and Research In Vehicle Evolution Act) was passed in the House in 2017 but did not advance in the Senate. The bill would have provided NHTSA with the authority to regulate AVs. NHTSA would be authorized to require safety assessment certifications and states would be preempted from enacting laws regarding the design, construction, or performance of AVs unless those laws enact standards identical to federal standards. In addition, the bill would have required that manufacturers of AVs develop written cybersecurity and privacy plans for such vehicles prior to offering them for sale. The AV START Act (American Vision for Safer Transportation through Advancement of Revolutionary Technologies Act) was introduced in the Senate in 2017 but did not advance. Like the SELF DRIVE Act, it would have established a framework for a federal role in oversight of AVs, preempting state laws and providing clarity to stakeholders including car manufacturers and insurance companies.\n\nIt remains to be seen when federal legislation on AVs will be passed, although there are promising signs. Reportedly, there is currently bipartisan support for federal legislation, notably from Republican Senator John Thune and Democratic Senator Gary Peters (who were co-sponsors of the AV START Act). While the Biden administration did not mention autonomous vehicles in its recently proposed infrastructure and jobs plan (instead focusing on electric vehicles and charging stations), Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has stated, \xe2\x80\x9cAutomated vehicle technology is coming, it\xe2\x80\x99s advancing very quickly, it is something that holds the potential to be transformative, and I think in many ways policy has not kept up.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nExisting regulatory barriers: Spectrum\n\nOne important issue to be resolved is around communication standards between autonomous vehicles. The 5.9 GHz spectrum, a 75 MHz band, had initially been set aside for use for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications in 1999, and NHTSA, car manufacturers, and device manufacturers spent the ensuing two decades working on a standard for V2V communications. However, the standard that emerged, called Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC), continues to face considerable resistance, including from a competing standard called Cellular-Vehicle-to-Vehicle (C-V2V). DSRC allows direct communication between two DSRC-enabled devices without relying on an intermediary, such as a cellular network, which in principle makes it fast and deployable in areas without cellular coverage. However, research by Gyawali et al (2020) suggests that DSRC only works well when two vehicles are in sight of each other and not moving too fast.7 C-V2V operates through a cellular network, which may limit its ability to function well in remote areas but handles communications between vehicles that are moving quickly (Gyawali et al 2020).\n\nSeparately, Wi-Fi demands have been growing, and the 5.9 GHz spectrum is increasingly being used for unlicensed Wi-Fi. A 2018 study by Rand Corporation estimated that the value of the consumer and producer surplus from using the entire band for Wi-Fi to be between $82.2 billion and $189.9 billion. In November 2019 Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Ajit Pai announced a plan whereby 45 MHz at the lower end of the band will be made available for Wi-Fi, the next 20 MHz for C-V2V, and the top 10 MHz potentially for C-V2V or DSRC. In November 2020 the FCC voted in favor of the proposal, despite objections by the Trump administration\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Transportation. There are calls for the Biden administration to reverse the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s decision. The plan would seem to bolster the C-V2V standard relative to DSRC, which may hasten resolution of the standards battle, and also favors use of Wi-Fi over transportation. It will be important for policymakers to consider the tradeoffs associated with use of the spectrum. On the one hand, demand for spectrum for Wi-Fi enabled devices is a growing and current need. In contrast, there is currently little need for spectrum for autonomous vehicles\xe2\x80\x94there aren\xe2\x80\x99t any commercially available and consumer demand seems low. On the other hand, spectrum for autonomous vehicles will likely be a future need, and the economic benefits of autonomous vehicles may outweigh the benefits of additional Wi-Fi.\n\nConclusion\n\nAutonomous vehicles will likely transform our economy, including changing the role of humans in transportation-related industries and potentially reducing emissions and increasing safety, all of which should ultimately lead to economic growth. However, large-scale adoption of autonomous vehicles and the ensuing economic growth will likely take time. The technology is still in development and consumers remain wary of autonomous vehicles. Moreover, federal and state legislation is still nascent, and there are competing standards for communication between vehicles. All of this needs to be resolved before AVs can become a \xe2\x80\x9ckiller app.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEditor\xe2\x80\x99s Note: This paper was updated from a previous version to reflect a change in Tesla vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s SAE automation level from 3 to 2.\n\nThe authors did not receive financial support from any firm or person for this article or from any firm or person with a financial or political interest in this article.

Enabling an even faster connection between transport systems, the 5G network will offer new application options advancing the development of autonomous cars. Not only will they be able to make autonomous decisions in the future, they will also communicate and cooperate with each other. Automated driving is the term used to describe a scenario where a fully interconnected and intelligent road transport system is created as a result of these capabilities.\n\n5G network as important foundation for autonomous driving\n\nIntelligent transport infrastructure through interconnectedness\n\nThe foundations for autonomous driving are fast and reliable communication networks, such as LTE and 5G. Therefore, Deutsche Telekom plans to install the 5G network on all key transport routes \xe2\x80\x93 such as freeways, main roads, and rail tracks \xe2\x80\x93 by 2025. Experts from various sectors are working at the 5G Automotive Association (5GAA), defining the basics for common standards in order to ensure that the new mobile communication standard meets the specific requirements for interconnecting the various transport users and for automated driving.\n\nThanks to wireless technology and internet connection, connected cars with their digital and location-related services can greatly improve our driving comfort. The car relies on regular data updates for navigation, e.g. detailed road maps, plus updates in unexpected traffic situations, such as congestion, rain, or black ice. In combination with apps for the driver and cloud systems, information for maintenance or other status reports can be retrieved and sent. Thanks to mobile edge computing, these functions are already realized today, based on LTE at a transmission rate of up to 300 megabit per second and latencies of less than 100 milliseconds, even in emergencies or remote-controlled driving at low speeds. 5G will offer even higher quality for many digital in-car services in the future.\n\n5G network expands automated systems\n\nSafety aspects are of course also a focus of attention for driving a car. In addition to the 4G capabilities, 5G offers special features for safety-relevant requirements that no other wireless network can provide.\n\nAutomated systems reach their limits when unexpected or unknown situations occur. In such a case an ""autopilot"" will decide to deactivate the system for safety reasons, if in doubt. An automated car would then return the task and responsibility of driving to the human driver. However, if the vehicle is not taken over by the driver, or not as quickly as required, then the car will be moved to the roadside in a secure driving mode.\n\nWith 5G, the car could, for instance, be controlled remotely by an external operator acting as traffic controller. The remote control through an operator is, however, definitely impossible without a 5G network, which offers key features such as very short response times and guaranteed network resources.\n\nBenefits of 5G for autonomous driving\n\nOne huge benefit of 5G is what is known as network slicing. The wireless network is subdivided into virtual network levels. One network level is then used only for automated driving, for instance. This ensures that safety-relevant notifications to self-driving cars will not end up in a traffic jam on the data highway and will be given priority over other infotainment services used in parallel.\n\nAnother benefit is the data processing and storage in data centers that are in close proximity to the transport routes. Such ""edge"" data centers ensure that data can be processed even faster in the network. In initial 5G tests on the A9 freeway between Nuremberg and Munich, latencies of less than 20 milliseconds were achieved. An autonomous car driving at a speed of 100 km/h would have traveled a mere 60 centimeters in that time. The virtual network levels and short transmission paths guarantee important quality features of the 5G mobile technology, such as low latencies and high bandwidths.\n\nSensors are used to implement car-to-car communication for automated driving. This includes, for example, intelligent camera systems, which enable the direct exchange of data between the cars. These systems have crucial physical disadvantages, however. They can neither look around corners, nor over hills, nor through obstacles. This is why they restrict the functioning of self-driving cars. This simple form of automation is also unsuitable at higher speeds.\n\nThis is where the 5G network offers another huge advantage. The mobile technology expands the scope of autonomous mobility through direct and, above all, fast and broadband data communication with cars and an appropriately equipped transport infrastructure, such as traffic lights. This can ensure improved traffic flows, for example by enabling cars to travel at higher speeds or reducing their speed in good time when necessary.\n\nAutomated driving has already begun with assisted driving\n\nThe automation of vehicles happens gradually, however. Fully automated driving, which can operate reliably in a large number of driving situations, is only the final stage of a long-lasting process. Half of all cars are already equipped with intelligent assistance systems. These are digital navigations systems, parking assistance, or speed regulation systems using cruise control as well as distance-regulation systems. Functions of an autonomous steering system for cars are already partially performed by driver assistance systems, such as steering and lane keeping assistants. Cars that can park themselves are also already available today. Despite these assistants it is the driver who remains responsible at all times. If, however, the vehicle is fully automated, the responsibility shifts from the driver to the means of transport and consequently to its manufacturer or operator. This is why many of the automation functions will at first be limited to sufficiently controllable driving situations, such as driving at lower and medium speeds on freeways or parking in a demarcated parking space.\n\nAutomatism creates personal freedoms\n\nHumans use automated functions in their day-to-day lives mainly in order to save time, which can then be used in a more meaningful or convenient way.

"320.txt";"b'Why Driverless Cars?\n\nThe idea of an \xe2\x80\x9cautonomous\xe2\x80\x9d vehicle that can navigate without human intervention fascinates consumers, and they enjoy watching videos of motorists working on a laptop or reading the newspaper while riding passively in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat.\n\nOn the technology side, much attention has been given to how these vehicles navigate using sophisticated sensors paired with map information, satellite location signals and tremendous computing power. However, the real story is the potential benefits to consumers that could come from automated vehicles. These include:\n\nFewer Crashes: According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, more than 35,000 lives were lost on U.S. highways in 2015. In addition, the economic and societal costs of collisions are a staggering $836 billion per year. Studies estimate more than 94 percent of all collisions are the result of human error, and autonomous vehicles could potentially eliminate most crashes by managing the hazards of driving better than most people. A computerized car can react faster than a human, and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get distracted or tired, talk or text on a cell phone or suffer road rage.\n\nAccording to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, more than 35,000 lives were lost on U.S. highways in 2015.

Improved Fuel Economy: Shorter commute times and reduced braking and acceleration thanks to better traffic management equals less fuel used.

In addition, an autonomous vehicle connected to the infrastructure would know where the nearest open parking space is \xe2\x80\x93 so no more time and gas spent circling the block repeatedly waiting for a spot to open up. Road Use Efficiency: Autonomous vehicles will support more widespread use of car sharing, reducing the total number of vehicles on the road. Self-driving vehicles can also operate with less space between cars than is needed to allow for human driver reaction times. As a result, more vehicles can be accommodated on each mile of roadway, and could help identify specific areas for additional infrastructure.\n\nHowever, all of these benefits depend on a number of factors: achieving a critical mass of reliable autonomous vehicles that minimizes human input on driving, and creating interoperable and cooperative systems where vehicles and infrastructure can communicate in order to create more efficient traffic management, and consumer acceptance. These could be decades away.\n\nAutomated Vehicles to Hit the Road by 2020? Not So Fast\n\nWhen automakers and tech companies talk about Level 5 or fully self \xe2\x80\x93 driving vehicles, they aren\xe2\x80\x99t trying to find cars in a parking garage. Instead, modern vehicles are categorized by the level of autonomous technology they offer. Levels start at 0, for cars with no autonomous controls, and rise to Level 5 for cars that can perform all driving tasks and monitor the driving environment under all conditions in which a human driver could do the same.\n\nAutomakers and their partners, technology companies and research institutions are all working to develop self-driving technology and some experts say Level 5 vehicles could be on the road by 2020. In truth, autonomous technology exists on the road today in the form of safety features like adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking or lane keeping technologies that monitor the road and intervene when necessary.\n\nSome companies are already testing Level 4 or 5 vehicles, but these advanced technologies face technical challenges and human issues involving how drivers will interface with self-driving cars. Meanwhile, federal and state governments are determining how to adapt existing safety, licensing and liability laws and regulations to accommodate self-driving vehicles. As consumers slowly replace old cars with new cars, the U.S. will likely see a mix of vehicles with differing levels of automation on our roads for decades.\n\nAAA Q&A on Self-Driving Cars\n\nGreg Brannon has a bird\xe2\x80\x99s eye view of advancements in autonomous vehicles. As AAA\xe2\x80\x99s director of automotive engineering and industrial relations, Brannon manages the tests AAA runs on advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) such as adaptive cruise control and automatic emergency braking, which are precursors to fully-autonomous cars and trucks.\n\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s what Brannon has to say about where autonomous vehicle technology is today, its safety and security, and issues that will need to be addressed before fully automated self-driving cars hit the highway.'";"Autonomous Cars";"320.txt-Autonomous Cars"

Automated vehicles do not get distracted and can monitor their environment in 360-degree, high-precision 3D.\n\nAutomated vehicles can also provide increased mobility to seniors, children, people with disabilities and others who are unable or choose not to drive. They could operate more efficiently than conventional vehicles, reducing congestion and emissions.\n\nSAE, the Society of Automotive Engineers, identified six levels of vehicle automation starting with Level 0, or no automation whatsoever, through Level 5, in which the vehicle has complete control.

"339.txt";"b'By Erick Guerra\n\nAlthough technological, financial, and regulatory hurdles remain, fully autonomous vehicles will likely be driving themselves on city streets and highways in the next 20 years \xe2\x80\x94 well within a long-range planning horizon. Major car manufacturers already market and sell high-end vehicles with features like automated braking, self-parking, lane-departure warning, and variable-speed cruise control. Most are racing to develop fully autonomous vehicles \xe2\x80\x94 as are technology firms like Google and Uber \xe2\x80\x94 and nearly half a dozen states have passed laws allowing testing of driverless vehicles on public roads. (Current regulations require a human operator behind the wheel of an autonomous test vehicle, but these regulations are likely to change as the technology advances.)\n\nSelf-driving cars will have a number of social and economic effects. In addition to freeing drivers to engage in tasks other than driving, autonomous vehicles promise to reduce traffic collisions by removing humans, and thus human error and negligence, from behind the wheel. By allowing closer platooning and lowering the number of collisions, self-driving vehicles will also increase effective road capacity, particularly on highways.\n\nSince the initially steep upfront costs of driverless vehicles can be offset by lower labor costs, the freight, transit, and taxi industries could be early adopters of driverless technologies, affecting the country\'s 4.5 million bus, taxi, and truck drivers \xe2\x80\x94 mostly men with high school degrees or less, a demographic that has not fared well in the recent recession or the larger digital revolution.\n\nSelf-driving cars also could have profound, though highly uncertain, impacts on sustainability and urban form, two areas of particular interest to city and regional planners.\n\nTwo scenarios\n\nWhether self-driving cars reduce harmful emissions or the amount of land, energy, money, and other resources consumed by the transportation system depends largely on whether they reduce car ownership and driving. Optimists envision a future where driverless cars lead to a revolution in shared urban mobility. Why own a car when you can summon one to pick you up while avoiding the worries of parking, insurance, or maintenance?\n\nIn this scenario, the shift in ownership will also encourage payment based on miles driven and time of day rather than lumpy vehicle purchases, insurance fees, and parking. Instead of thinking about how much gas is in the tank, travelers will now consider the full marginal cost of a car trip when deciding whether to walk, bike, drive, or take transit. Transit service may also improve as a result of shared cars and minivans operating on fixed and flexible routes.\n\nThe biggest opportunity for improvement is in cities and neighborhoods where densities are currently too low to justify frequent bus or rail service. If shared or public, self-driving cars will dramatically reduce the demand for parking. Even privately owned vehicles will drop off passengers at front doors before driving off-site or behind a building to park, thus decoupling parking from other urban land uses. This would allow cities to dedicate more space to housing, shops, and offices, as well as stormwater management, street trees, and other sustainable features.\n\nPessimists, by contrast, see vehicle automation as one more technology that makes driving more comfortable and convenient and thus increases the amount that people drive. In this scenario, most households will own one or more self-driving cars, send their vehicles to run errands, circle to avoid paying for parking, and treat travel as if it had zero or very low time costs.\n\nMany cars may become full-time mobile offices, whisking people between meetings, and the number of workers commuting between metropolitan regions will almost certainly increase. Making long commutes more productive will support the growing trend in long-duration commutes. Between 1990 and 2010, the proportion of commuters traveling more than 60 minutes and more than 90 minutes to work increased from six to eight percent and 1.6 to 2.5 percent, respectively.\n\nSelf-driving cars will also expand personal mobility for the third of the population without drivers\' licenses and the tenth of households without cars due to age, disability, low income, or preference. A demonstration video of one of Google\'s prototype self-driving cars features a legally blind man riding to a Taco Bell in a self-driving vehicle.\n\nExpanded access to cars may be particularly important for the nation\'s elderly, many of whom live in and would like to remain in car-dependent communities. In this scenario, even if self-driving cars double existing capacity, this capacity will fill quickly \xe2\x80\x94 encouraging dispersed development and greater land consumption, which would further erode any sustainability benefits from increased efficiency.\n\nGlass half full or half empty?\n\nWhose view is more realistic \xe2\x80\x94 the optimists\' or the pessimists\'? Both may be partially correct. Net effects will vary across states, cities, and neighborhoods. In dense urban areas with good transit where the demand for space and shared mobility is higher, driverless cars will tend to increase density and improve transit. In sprawling areas, self-driving cars will encourage more sprawl by making it easier to live farther from employment centers and other destinations. Urban cores will likely concentrate while peripheral areas expand. Suburban areas will probably continue to rely on privately owned vehicles but could see improvements in transit and shared mobility.\n\nWhat can planners do to prepare for driverless vehicles? The new technology could produce rapid and radical changes to metropolitan transportation systems, particularly freight and transit. However, the timing, scale, and direction of the impacts are uncertain and the opportunities to influence outcomes are limited. For better or worse, major changes to passenger travel might be slow to materialize \xe2\x80\x94 the technology remains expensive and the vehicle fleet turns over slowly (the average passenger car is just over 11 years old). Some 15 years after the commercial release of the Toyota Prius, hybrid vehicles make up only a tiny share of the U.S. car fleet.\n\nRegardless, planners should pay close attention to the technology, start thinking about which regulations (particularly on-site parking requirements) could change quickly in response to new technologies, and perhaps redirect capital investments away from infrastructure-heavy projects with a long lifespan to shorter term, more flexible projects that are insulated from some of the uncertainty around the timing and impacts of self-driving cars.\n\nErick Guerra is an assistant professor of city and regional planning at the University of Pennsylvania, where his research focuses on the relationships between transportation infrastructure, land use, urban development, and travel behavior.\n\nWeb-Only Expanded Sidebar\n\nRead ""Attention: The Age of Automation Is Right Ahead,"" an expanded version of the article that appeared in the printed magazine.\n\nResources\n\nImage: This early prototype of Google\'s self-driving car was designed to go from point A to point B without human intervention.

"343.txt";"b'The California Department of Motor Vehicles said this week it\xe2\x80\x99s reviewing whether Tesla is telling people that its cars are self-driving when, legally speaking, they\xe2\x80\x99re not. This follows fatal crashes that may have involved its Autopilot feature. Tesla advertises a \xe2\x80\x9cFull Self-Driving\xe2\x80\x9d upgrade option. One man has been busted in Teslas more than once for reckless driving. He hangs out in the backseat and steers with his feet.\n\nMeanwhile, no cars are fully self-driving yet. I spoke with Missy Cummings, the director of the Humans and Autonomy Laboratory at Duke University. She says the so-called deep learning that cars need to see the road around them doesn\xe2\x80\x99t actually learn. The following is an edited transcript of our conversation.\n\nMissy Cummings (Photo courtesy Duke University)\n\nMissy Cummings: I can show a convolutional neural net a million images of a stop sign, and it will learn what a stop sign is from those images. But if it sees a stop sign that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t match exactly those images, then it can\xe2\x80\x99t recognize it. And this is a huge problem, because if a strand of kudzu leaves starts to grow across just the top 20% of a stop sign, that is enough to make that algorithm be dumb, and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t recognize it, because it\xe2\x80\x99s never seen a stop sign with one strand of kudzu leaves across it.\n\nMolly Wood: Is there an awareness of this, do you think? Is everybody sort of still trying to push the same solution when it comes to self-driving cars? Are people starting to realize these limitations and internalize them and change their approach at all?\n\nCummings: I think there are three camps of people not just in self-driving, but in robotics and artificial intelligence in general. There\xe2\x80\x99s the camp of people like me who know the reality. We recognize it for what it is, we\xe2\x80\x99ve recognized it for some time, and we know that unless we change fundamentally the way that we\xe2\x80\x99re approaching this problem, it is not solvable with our current approach. There\xe2\x80\x99s another larger group of people who recognize that there are some problems but feel like with enough money and enough time, we can solve it. And then there\xe2\x80\x99s a third group of people that no matter what you tell them, they believe that we can solve this problem. And you can\xe2\x80\x99t talk them off that platform.\n\nChange the approach to the problem\n\nThe people who are the biggest problem are the people in that second group, the ones that believe that with enough time and money, we can fix it, instead of recognizing the elephant in the room for what it is, which is not fixable under our current approach. And this is why you see companies like Starsky, a trucking company that went out of business, and you starting to see all the mergers across the automotive industry where all companies are either teaming up with each other or with software companies, because they realize that they just cannot keep hemorrhaging money the way they are. But that pit still has no bottom. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t see this becoming a viable commercial set of operations in terms of self-driving cars for anyone anywhere, ever, until we address this problem.\n\nWood: What about the tests that seem to be going fine, like Waymo testing fully operating taxis in Phoenix with no support drivers and not having crashes?\n\nCummings: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s interesting to me that that\xe2\x80\x99s your perception, because that\xe2\x80\x99s the perception that Waymo wants you to have. But the reality is behind every self-driving car in Phoenix, there are a team of humans that are remotely monitoring and potentially intervening when the systems go down. And there was recently a video that went viral on YouTube, where a Waymo car in its fully self-driving mode got stuck by a single orange cone. And eventually, they had to send a team of people to put a human in the car and drive the poor passenger out of the conundrum that he was in. And this is very recent. And you have to ask yourself, if we are having a car that supposedly is fully self-driving, so there\xe2\x80\x99s no driver, but we have to have a team of four to six people managing that one car for problems. First of all, that\xe2\x80\x99s not scalable.\n\nIntervention needed\n\nAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s not really self-driving if there has to be so much intervention. And if that\xe2\x80\x99s where we are in technology today, how are we going to make a business out of this? And John Krafcik, the former CEO of Waymo, I mean, he recently left. I feel like John, in that way, was basically admitting what I have been trying to tell people all these years, is that we just can\xe2\x80\x99t solve this problem in the way that you think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to. We need to completely clean sheet this and start over.\n\nWood: So when we see Uber and Lyft, for example, essentially exiting this self-driving car business, do you think it is a sign of companies who have sort of said \xe2\x80\x9cthis is just a money pit\xe2\x80\x9d?\n\nCummings: Yes, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly right.\n\nWood: On the other hand, we have Tesla, which is not doing any of that. What are we to make of that?\n\nCummings: Well, I think the Tesla situation is a little different. Should they be allowed to call their driving assist technology Full Self-Driving? So that\xe2\x80\x99s one problem. And then, if you want to ask, is Tesla ever going to have a robotaxi program? I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you, that answer is no. But that problem is less acute for Tesla, because they have what is otherwise a great product. I love Tesla cars. I just think Autopilot and especially Full Self-Driving are both overhyped, and they underdeliver in terms of performance, and they\xe2\x80\x99re dangerous.\n\nWood: So there\xe2\x80\x99s a math problem and there is a pretty significant marketing problem?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe religion of Tesla\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nCummings: That\xe2\x80\x99s right. So I think that we\xe2\x80\x99re starting to see increasing numbers of crashes in this country and abroad, where drivers think that their car is far more capable. I think what is interesting to me was how the Tesla driver who got arrested for being in his backseat while he was driving vocalized that he\xe2\x80\x99d already been warned once, and he defied the warning and did it again, and then said he would keep doing it because he knows Elon [Musk] knows what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing. And he fully believes in Tesla.\n\nAnd so what I find most interesting about that statement is that one man is vocalizing what so many people believe. They believe that this technology really can be fully self-driving, despite all the warnings and despite all the statements and the owner\xe2\x80\x99s manual, and you having to agree that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to pay attention. Despite all of those warnings, there\xe2\x80\x99s some belief likely based in calling a technology Full Self-Driving and calling it Autopilot where people believe in the religion of Tesla full self-driving, and that is dangerous.\n\nRelated links: More insight from Molly Wood\n\nTesla\xe2\x80\x99s website does call the upgrade option Full Self-Driving, but also says the cars can\xe2\x80\x99t drive themselves. Back in March, a Tesla engineer told the DMV that despite Elon Musk\xe2\x80\x99s claims that the company would have a fully self-driving car by the end of this year, that claim did not match the engineering reality. For a refresher, there are five agreed-upon levels of autonomous driving, where No. 1 is you driving your car with your hands and feet, and No. 5 is the car doing everything while you sleep in the back seat in a way that does not endanger you or everyone around you. The Tesla engineer told the DMV, according to a memo produced by the agency, that Tesla is currently at level 2 \xe2\x80\x94 some self-driving functionality, but requiring a human with hands on the wheel at all times.\n\nHere is a column about deep learning and why that author also thinks the tech is too limited to be able to adapt to real-world conditions, because the algorithms would have to pre-learn every single possible thing that could happen on the road \xe2\x80\x94 from a kudzu stop sign to a spaceship landing on the freeway. There\xe2\x80\x99s also a little more reading and listening on Uber and Lyft getting out of the self-driving game. Marketplace\xe2\x80\x99s Meghan McCarty Carino covered that on the \xe2\x80\x9cMarketplace Morning Report.\n\n\n\nApple might still be working on this \xe2\x80\x94 maybe? It got a patent in March for a night-vision tech system to let its self-driving cars see in the dark. Earlier this week, MacReports noted that Apple has increased the number of self-driving cars it\xe2\x80\x99s registered with the DMV from 66 to 68, but dramatically decreased the number of people licensed to operate those cars. And it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t applied for a driverless testing permit. Apple has been flirting off and on with self-driving cars for a few years now. First it laid off almost everyone involved with its so-called Project Titan, and then it bought a self-driving car startup that was almost defunct. So I guess that puts them in the second category of technologists that Missy Cummings described. We\xe2\x80\x99ll call them the self-driving Dorys \xe2\x80\x94 you know, the fish that just keeps swimming.'";"Autonomous Cars";"343.txt-Autonomous Cars"

These technologies do offer tremendous safety promise, as they can prevent or lessen the severity of a crash. CDOT is evaluating how roadway design (striping, pavement markings, and signs) can improve the performance of these driver assistance technologies.\n\nThere are manufacturers and other companies that are interested in testing, deploying and researching vehicles that change the basic architecture of the vehicle or remove the human driver.

If the exact location of the surrounding objects is known, this technology can provide the absolute vehicle location with assistance from a high amount of map data. When integrated with complimentary technology such as: ultrasonic, inertial motion, digital maps, radar/LiDAR and cameras, GNSS acts as the sixth sense to deliver the positioning performance required by autonomous vehicles.\n\nMany technologies onboard vehicles provide local or relative localization. GNSS provides an absolute localization solution, and with the following technologies can achieve the accuracy and availability requirements of a full autonomous driving solution.\n\nSPAN\xc2\xae GNSS+INS Navigation\n\nWith the growing developments in automotive technology, the need for accurate, reliable and robust ground reference has emerged. Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) + Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) are an essential component of achieving high accuracy ground truth, mobile mapping and real-time precise positioning for autonomy. NovAtel delivers SPAN\xc2\xae GNSS+INS technology in easy-to-integrate packages designed to determine truth trajectories and benchmark your autonomous solution.\n\n\n\nWhy use SPAN?\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh Rate Data:\n\nUsers have access to high-rate, smooth solutions, essential for high-speed freeway/highway driving.\n\nAccuracy and Flexibility:\n\nWhen combined with Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) corrections and post-processing, SPAN offers the best possible solution even through tunnels and ultra-challenging urban canyon situations. Flexibility of the system allows for the addition of a wheel sensor and other external inputs to further refine your solution.\n\nHardware Robustness:\n\nInternal logging and multiple communication interfaces allow for customized utilization and flexibility when integrating into test vehicles.\n\nInterference Toolkit\n\nThe Interference Toolkit (ITK) provides the functionality to monitor, quantify and remove those unintentional interference sources that impact receiver performance. ITK has built-in features to pre-survey demonstration sites, scan for possible interference sources within the vehicle and remove interference.\n\nITK includes two main components:\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Spectrum analysis output:\n\nPlot signal levels on the vertical axis over a range of frequencies on the horizontal axis. The spectral analysis tools show how much signal power is being sensed across the different GNSS frequency bands. When an interference signal is present it can be visualized in the spectral analysis plot.\n\n2. Advanced signal processing and digital filtering:\n\nMitigate and remove interference with built-in software, applied signal processing and digital filters. These processing techniques suppress interference, allowing the GNSS signals to track and the receiver to continue to operate normally.\n\nWhy use ITK for Ground Truth?\n\nTo pre-survey demonstration areas to identify and remove possible sources of interference\n\nTo identify interference sources within the vehicle\n\nTo remove interference with built-in filters\n\nWaypoint\xc2\xae Post-Processing\n\nWaypoint Software provides an ideal solution for applications that require accurate post-mission position, velocity or attitude. Post-processing with Waypoint maximizes the accuracy of the ground truth trajectory by processing forward and reverse in time, backsmoothing and combining the results. It provides the ability to assess the solution reliability and accuracy with extensive quality analysis and plotting tools.\n\nWhy use Waypoint for Ground Truth?\n\nIt maximizes accuracy of GNSS+INS test trajectories\n\nIt provides the ability to offset and transform between reference datums\n\nExport profiles are customizable to meet varying needs\n\nReal-time and post-processed quality can be compared\n\nIt is easy to export to Google Earth for test review\n\nGNSS Corrections\n\nGNSS signals, without corrections, provide positioning accuracy of five to ten meters (16-32 feet). Corrections can be generated by a number of sources or methods, and system developers must choose the corrections method that best meets the demands of their application.\n\nCorrections work in combinations with multi-frequency measurements from the GNSS to provide sub-decimeter to centimeter-level accuracy \xe2\x80\x93 depending on the correction source.'";"Autonomous Cars";"354.txt-Autonomous Cars"
"355.txt";"b'An autonomous vehicle, or a driverless vehicle, is one that is able to operate itself and perform necessary functions without any human intervention, through ability to sense its surroundings.\n\nAn autonomous vehicle utilises a fully automated driving system in order to allow the vehicle to respond to external conditions that a human driver would manage.\n\nWhat are the 6 Levels of Autonomous Vehicles?\n\nThere are six different levels of automation and, as the levels increase, the extent of the driverless car\xe2\x80\x99s independence regarding operation control increases.\n\nAt level 0, the car has no control over its operation and the human driver does all of the driving.\n\nAt level 1, the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s ADAS (advanced driver assistance system) has the ability to support the driver with either steering or accelerating and braking.\n\nAt level 2, the ADAS can oversee steering and accelerating and braking in some conditions, although the human driver is required to continue paying complete attention to the driving environment throughout the journey, while also performing the remainder of the necessary tasks.\n\nAt level 3, the ADS (advanced driving system) can perform all parts of the driving task in some conditions, but the human driver is required to be able to regain control when requested to do so by the ADS. In the remaining conditions, the human driver executes the necessary tasks.\n\nAt level 4, the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s ADS is able to perform all driving tasks independently in certain conditions in which human attention is not required.\n\nFinally, level 5 involves full automation whereby the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s ADS is able to perform all tasks in all conditions, and no driving assistance is required from the human driver. This full automation will be enabled by the application of 5G technology, which will allow vehicles to communicate not just with one another, but also with traffic lights, signage and even the roads themselves.\n\nOne of the aspects of the vehicle technology used in automated vehicles is ACC, or adaptive cruise control. This system is able to adjust the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s speed automatically to ensure that it maintains a safe distance from the vehicles in front of it. This function relies on information obtained using sensors on the vehicle and allows the car to perform tasks such as brake when it senses that it is approaching any vehicles ahead. This information is then processed and the appropriate instructions are sent to actuators in the vehicle, which control the responsive actions of the car such as steering, acceleration and braking. Highly automated vehicles with fully automated speed control are able to respond to signals from traffic lights and other such non-vehicular activities.\n\nWhat are the Advantages?\n\nAutonomous vehicle technology may be able to provide certain advantages compared to human-driven vehicles. One such potential advantage is that they could provide increased safety on the road \xe2\x80\x93 vehicle crashes cause many deaths every year, and automated vehicles could potentially decrease the number of casualties as the software used in them is likely to make fewer errors in comparison to humans. A decrease in the number of accidents could also reduce traffic congestion, which is a further potential advantage posed by autonomous vehicles. Autonomous driving can also achieve this by the removal of human behaviours that cause blockages on the road, specifically stop-and-go traffic.\n\nAnother possible advantage of automated driving is that people who are not able to drive \xe2\x80\x93 due to factors like age and disabilities \xe2\x80\x93 could be able to use automated cars as more convenient transport systems.\n\nAdditional advantages that come with an autonomous car are elimination of driving fatigue and being able to sleep during overnight journeys.'";"Autonomous Cars";"355.txt-Autonomous Cars"

Further to this, what will actually be transported in self-driving vehicles is another interesting question. With a steep expansion in ecommerce, the flow of goods in cities is suited to smaller vehicles. The traditional logistic systems will be challenged by this development, and self-driving vehicles might be used to transport goods when not transporting people. Therefore self-driving cars, to some extent, may replace trucks in order to improve parcel delivery for transport companies with a need for micro logistics around a city.\n\nIn the 2014 Ericsson ConsumerLab report, Connectivity Beyond the Screen, 67 percent of smartphone owners said they were interested in a same-day delivery service that works on any device, online and in stores. As an example of this, Amazon is gradually expanding its same-day and one-day delivery services (that initially started in the US) to many cities across the world, with Toronto in Canada being the most recent addition.13 Furthermore, Amazon has also started a rideshare-like delivery service called Amazon Flex, where drivers deliver parcels in a similar setup to companies such as Uber.14\n\nWhile autonomous vehicles may mean that those who love driving will get to do it less, there will be many other benefits to people both inside and outside the car.

"366.txt";"b'As of early 2021, multiple rumors have suggested that Apple has entered into negotiations with well-known automative electronics suppliers for components for a potential upcoming vehicle-related product, and Apple is also said to be working to establish a production facility in the United States.\n\nApple was rumored to be cosidering a partnership with Hyundai for manufacturing the Apple Car, with plans to transition the Apple Car development to its Kia brand as part of an arrangement that could see production happen in the United States, but that hasn\'t panned out.\n\nRumors suggested that under the partnership with Hyundai, Hyundai Mobis would be in charge of design and production for some Apple Car components, and Hyundai Group affiliate Kia would provide the U.S. production line for Apple Cars. Hyundai executives were said to be divided over the prospect of a deal with Apple, though Apple planned to invest 4 trillion won ($3.6 billion) in Kia Motors, with Kia set to manufacture the Apple Car in its U.S. facility located in Georgia.\n\nApple reportedly considered Hyundai-Kia because the deal would give Apple access to an established automaker with the capability to produce vehicles in North America. Hyundai-Kia was also willing to give Apple control over both the Apple Car software and the hardware, with Apple planning for a full Apple-branded vehicle and not a Kia model that included Apple software.\n\nDespite all the rumors of an Apple/Hyundai-Kia partnership, Apple paused the talks and has also been discussing Apple Car plans with other automobile manufacturers. According to Bloomberg, Apple was upset that Hyundai confirmed that it was in talks with Apple even though Hyundai eventually retracted and revised the statement.\n\nHyundai and its Kia affiliate confirmed in February 2021 that they are not in discussions with Apple to cooperate on the development of a self-driving electric vehicle, so it appears the discussions between Apple and the two car manufacturing companies may have been tabled for now. It\'s not clear if the talks will resume, but some Korean media sites do believe that the partnership could survive and Apple could opt to go with Kia.\n\nApple also allegedly approached Nissan about a potential partnership, but negotiations were brief and did not make it up to executive levels due to disagreements over Apple Car specifics. The two companies clashed over the idea of a partnership, with Nissan worried that Apple would downgrade it to a simple hardware supplier. Apple wants full control over the Apple Car\'s design and software, and Nissan has said that it has no plans to change the way that it makes cars. Nissan has since confirmed that it is not in talks with Apple.\n\nAccording to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple\'s initial vehicle chassis could be based on Hyundai\'s E-GMP electriv vehicle (BEV) platform, which uses up to two motors, five-link rear suspension, an integrated drive axle, battery cells that can provide range over 500km on a full charge, and can be charged up to 80% within 18 minutes through high-speed charging. A high performance model based on E-GMP is capable of accelerating from 0-60 miles per hour in less than 3.5 seconds, with a top speed of 160 miles per hour.\n\nApple may also work with General Motors and European manufacturer PSA for subsequent models or in other markets. Apple\'s ""deep collaboration"" with manufacturing partners will shorten Apple car development time.\n\nBloomberg\'s Mark Gurman has explained that Apple is struggling to find an appropriate existing automaker to build its vehicle and automakers are said to be concerned about the implications of such an agreement on their own brand. As a result, Apple is reportedly looking into contract manufacturers such as Foxconn, which has an existing relationship with the company.\n\nFoxconn is the main assembler of iPhones, and also recently unveiled an electric vehicle chassis and a software platform to help carmakers bring models to market faster. Contract manufacturer Magna is purportedly another possibility, but Apple may also choose to manufacture the vehicle itself.\n\nAccording to The Korea Times, Apple is ""very near"" to signing an agreement with LG Magna e-Powertrain. Apple is apparently comfortable with LG Magna e-Powertrain\'s smaller manufacturing capacity, from which it may be inferred that the company does not intend to produce the vehicle on the same large scale as other major automakers. Apple\'s first-generation of electric vehicles is reportedly seen as an opportunity to evaluate the project\'s marketability, rather than a true mass-market vehicle.\n\nIf the agreement with LG Magna e-Powertrain is reached, the two parties will then jointly establish the precise details for the production of the Apple car, and a prototype will apparently be teased in early 2024.\n\nApple in June 2021 entered into ""early-stage talks"" with two Chinese companies that might supply batteries for a future Apple Car. Apple is discussing battery options with CATL and BYD, with Apple pushing for the building of manufacturing facilities in the United States.\n\nApple may instead be planning to work with Taiwanese manufacturers on batteries that are could be made in the U.S. Taiwan-based Foxconn and Advanced Lithium Electrochemistry both plan to set up factories in the United States that could end up manufacturing batteries for the Apple Car.\n\nApple in 2021 also sent a team of Apple Car employees to South Korea to meet with LG, the SK group, and others to discuss possible business opportunities related to the Apple Car. Apple is continuing to work to find new partners to join its supply chain for the upcoming vehicle. Apple is pursuing companies who can make lithium iron phosphate batteries, which Korean suppliers mass produce.\n\nApple in September was rumored to be visiting Toyota as talks to find and secure suppliers continue.'";"Autonomous Cars";"366.txt-Autonomous Cars"

The accident was described as minor with no injuries.\n\nThe second accident [PDF] occurred on August 23 in Cupertino, California, right near the Apple Park campus. The vehicle with Apple's self-driving equipment was in manual mode and it was stopped in traffic when it was rear ended by a Subaru Outback.\n\nBoth of these incidents were not the fault of the self-driving vehicle or the person operating the vehicle, and are largely not notable.

"368.txt";"b'Last Updated 9/222020\n\nAccording to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA),""autonomous"" or ""self-driving"" vehicles are those in which operation of the vehicle occurs without direct driver input to control the steering, acceleration, and braking and are designed so that the driver is not expected to constantly monitor the roadway while operating in self-driving mode. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers predict that 75% of cars on the roads in the world will be autonomous by 2040. Moreover, a 2018 KPMG Study predicts that self-driving cars may become a commercial reality in the next five years.\n\nGoogle is the pioneer in autonomous driving technology. In 2005, Google established a team of engineers, led by Sebastian Thrun, who developed a robotic vehicle that won a contest sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Since 2009, Google (now Waymo), has been test-driving autonomous vehicles on public roads, traveling more than 10 million miles in over 25 U.S. cities. According to previous crash reports, Waymo cars have been in numerous minor accidents, but only one accident in 2016, was reported to be the fault of Google\'s self-driving car. In 2017, the company removed monthly accidents reports from their site and they will no longer be publicly available.\n\nWaymo continues to be the industry leader in driverless technology. In December of 2018, the company officially launched Waymo One, the nation\xe2\x80\x99s first autonomous vehicle taxi service, in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nGoogle believes that self-driving cars can make driving more efficient and safer by eliminating distracted driving and other human error. According to NHTSA, 3,166 fatalities in 2017 were crashes involving distracted drivers, while an additional 10,874 fatalities involved an alcohol-impaired driver. A KMPG report predicts that by 2050, the adoption of autonomous vehicle technology could reduce the frequency of accidents by almost 90%.\n\nAs excitement and momentum for self-driving cars grows, there are numerous insurance questions that will need to be addressed before such vehicles take the road. For example: What happens if a self-driving car gets into an accident? Who is liable for the damages? Will the human ""copilot"" be at fault or will the car\'s manufacturer? Will the \'driver\' have to maintain a constant vigil on the road ahead at all times? What are they allowed to do inside the vehicle\xe2\x80\xa6can they nap, read a book or text message while the car does all the navigating? Will they even need a driver\'s license? A 2017 KMPG report highlights the ""chaotic middle"" the auto insurance industry is facing in this new period.\n\nThere is also a long list of safety and legal issues to iron out before self-driving cars hit the road. In September 2017, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) presented, Automated Driving Systems: A Vision for Safety, as part of U.S. Department of Transportation\'s (DOT) multimodal efforts to support the safe introduction of automation technologies. In July 2018, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) released the Comprehensive Management Plan for Automated Vehicle Initiatives as a response to the requirements in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (Omnibus Bill) signed into law on March 23, 2018, directing the (DOT) to conduct research on the development of Automated Vehicles (AV).\n\nCurrently, twenty-nine states and Washington D.C. have enacted legislation related to autonomous vehicles, while eleven governors issued executive orders regarding autonomous vehicles. Getting the technology to make the vehicles is only half the challenge; the other half will be creating a legal, liability and regulatory framework to govern their use on public streets.\n\nStatus: The NAIC Innovation and Technology (EX) Task Force is charged with monitoring emerging technologies like autonomous vehicles in the insurance sector. The Task Force provides a forum for discussion of innovation and technology developments in the insurance sector to provide resources for and educate state insurance regulators on how these developments impact consumer protection, insurer, and producer oversight. Additionally, the NAIC Center for Insurance Policy and Research (CIPR) held an Autonomous Vehicle forum in October 2018. Resources from this forum are available on the CIPR Events page. The CIPR also hosted a webinar, The Road Ahead for Autonomous Vehicles and Auto Insurance in December 2019.

"372.txt";"b'Autonomous vehicles are also known as self-driving cars, driverless cars, or robotic cars. The term self-driving car is becoming a standard as these technologies continue to mature.\n\nAutonomous vehicles rely on advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) systems to \xe2\x80\x9cunderstand\xe2\x80\x9d their environment and react to commands. Complex sensors and actuators, together with advanced computer vision functions are used to create a constantly updated map of their surroundings, detect the presence of nearby vehicles and pedestrians, measure distances and detect uneven surfaces in roads and sidewalks. Autonomous vehicles can also be interconnected with other external devices such as smart traffic lights and roads, although many of these ideas are still hypothetical.\n\nAn autonomous vehicle is a vehicle that can drive itself without input from a human driver. There are several types of self-driving vehicles, depending on their level of automation. These levels have been defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) which has set 6 of them adopted by the U.S. Department of Transportation ranging from Level 0 (fully manual) to Level 5 (fully autonomous).\n\nTechopedia Explains Autonomous Vehicle\n\nIn some ways, the story of the autonomous vehicle is a tale of technological evolution that is not finished yet, a gradual advance of integrated artificial intelligence services and sensor-based driver safety features that may or may not eventually replace human drivers entirely.\n\nAutonomous cars must rely on the presence of sensors situated in various parts of the vehicle to sense their surroundings. Lidar is mostly used for ranging purposes, measure distances, identify lane markings and anomalies such as holes and pits on the road.\n\nRadar sensors are used to track other vehicles, while video cameras can be used to read road signs and detect traffic lights. Advanced AI-powered software will then process all those inputs coming from sensors, and generate instructions to the car\xe2\x80\x99s actuators to plot paths, control steering, braking and acceleration, or dodge obstacles.\n\nEarly Advances in Autonomous Vehicles\n\nThe earliest edge of the autonomous driving frontier was the evolution of multiple driver safety features that are now standard in many new vehicles. For example, a lane departure warning system alerts drivers if the vehicle seems to be leaving a particular space on a multilane road. Parking assist features, automated braking, and other features also apply. Each one has its own specialized function and controls a given task.\n\nWhat these systems have in common is that, although they promote the idea of autonomous vehicle design, they still do not approach what some would call a self-driving car. The human driver is still in control, and needs to be in control, but utilizes the warnings and alerts to make better driving decisions.\n\nThese forms of partial automation that still require a human driver pertain to the SAE levels 0 to 2. Only when the automated system is in charge of monitoring the driving environment and human intervention is purely optional then a vehicle could be defined as \xe2\x80\x9cautonomous\xe2\x80\x9d (levels 3 to 5). As we progress toward autonomous vehicle design, intermediate types of autopilot systems are becoming more common, with Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s one being probably the most prominent.\n\nObstacles to Adoption of Autonomous Cars Technology\n\nFully autonomous (Level 5) vehicles are currently being tested, but we\xe2\x80\x99re still far from making them available to the general public. Although the autonomous vehicle has come a long way, it is not yet a common mode of transportation, and various obstacles to adoption apply.\n\nIn particular, some of the technologies required for build a functional self-driving car very expensive, making the final cost of each vehicle prohibitive for the general public. Radar and Lidar work for prototypes, but if mass production is achieved, their signals and frequency might interfere with one another.\n\nMany anomalous conditions such as snow, debris or oil may represent a significant challenge whenever they cover lane markings and dividers. Also, it\xe2\x80\x99s still early to trust AI to be smart enough to make consistent decisions or split-second judgement calls in life-or-death scenarios, such as when a pedestrian suddenly traverses the road after a steep turn.'";"Autonomous Cars";"372.txt-Autonomous Cars"

Learn why this has hundreds of software teams building their applications in the cloud across multiple use cases and industries.\n\nPresented by Pony.ai\n\nThe vision of safe, reliable autonomous vehicle transportation at scale is closer than ever to being realized, says James Peng, CEO at Pony.ai. Since the company\xe2\x80\x99s founding in Fremont, California in late 2016, the company\xe2\x80\x99s been making strides in autonomous mobility deployment in both the U.S. and China. The company was the first to launch and offer a public-facing Robotaxi service in both countries.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe technology is moving from experience-level to application,\xe2\x80\x9d Peng says. \xe2\x80\x9cThe first half of the game is to build stable and mature products and accumulate experience. The second half is to move from R&D to mass production and scale, in addition to achieving commercially viable products.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn 2019, Peng predicted that the world would see a wide adoption of fully autonomous driving vehicles on the open roads within five years, and that forecast is gaining momentum. Pony.ai just received a driverless permit from California DMV, a milestone for their engineers to perform driverless testing without a human driver behind the wheel on public roads within the state. These tests are accelerating commercial growth across their operation sites worldwide, and they plan to launch driverless Robotaxi service to the public in California starting in 2022.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m pretty confident that in many of the larger cities in the U.S., people will soon be able to ride with a driverless Robotaxi vehicle,\xe2\x80\x9d says Tiancheng Lou, CTO at Pony.ai. \xe2\x80\x9cA significant portion of taxi services will be supported by driverless vehicles.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPony.ai currently offers ride-hailing in its autonomous vehicles in five markets: Irvine and Fremont in California; as well as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou in China. The company plans to install its technology in hundreds of vehicles next year, rising to tens of thousands in 2024-2025.\n\nWaymo, Google\xe2\x80\x99s self-driving car arm, has been piloting a fleet of fully driverless robotaxis in Phoenix for the past year, while Amazon-owned Zoox unveiled its autonomous robotaxi service last December.\n\nThe goals of autonomous driving\n\nAccording to most companies, the biggest benefit of autonomous driving is safety. The U.S. Department of Transportation has reported that 94% of car crashes are caused by human error. While overall driving was down in 2020 because of the pandemic, traffic fatality rates surged 24% \xe2\x80\x94 the highest spike in nearly a century. Autonomous driving is the solution to this issue, Peng says, and companies like Pony.ai, Google, and Uber, along with most of the major automakers, are sinking considerable money into R&D, optimistic about the future of autonomous driving.\n\nA transition to autonomous vehicles also has potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and support U.S. economic growth, points out the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets. The coalition, which includes members Ford, Volvo, Lyft, Uber, and Waymo, promotes the benefits of fully self-driving vehicles and supports the fastest deployment possible \xe2\x80\x93 or advancing the scale of the technology, which would enable mass production and start moving autonomous vehicles to the center of the smart city vision.\n\nChallenges of driving autonomy at scale\n\nPony is hoping to achieve large enough scale to reduce costs and meet commercial needs by 2022 with Alpha X, the working name for their latest generation of autonomous vehicles, Lou says, which are designed to be manufactured on a production line.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo have a large number of vehicles, we need to manufacture them in a standardized way,\xe2\x80\x9d Lou says. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a critical step to achieve front-loading mass production of self-driving cars.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe company established a production line and a set of standardized processes specifically for L4-level autonomous driving systems last November. With the support of the production line, the production efficiency of the autonomous driving system doubled six times compared with the previous generation, and production pace accelerated.\n\nWith PonyAlpha X, they established a L4 level autonomous driving system scale production line, Lou says. To manufacture the vehicle, they established a supply chain management process, hardware module design and verification, test production, and car conversion before final assembly. The end phase consists of overall quality inspection, off-line calibration, and road testing. The project helps them set up a standardized production process, which shortened production time, effectively reduced costs, and improved the stability of the overall system.\n\nCompared with the previous generation, PonyAlpha X is more compact, integrated, and lightweight in terms of system hardware integration, reducing the cost of post-maintenance. They recently partnered with Toyota to equip PonyAlpha X on Lexus RX models.\n\nIn February of this year, the company rolled out the new self-driving vehicles equipped with the latest generation system from the standardized production line. The cars will go through all-day autonomous-driving open-road tests in Guangzhou, Beijing, and Shanghai before they join the company\xe2\x80\x99s Robotaxi fleet for large-scale operations.\n\nTheir recent partnership with Luminar, an autonomous vehicle sensor and software company, has also allowed them to significantly bring down the cost of manufacturing, which is always a major hurdle for mass production.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the next generation, one of the biggest challenges is we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to use auto-grade sensors,\xe2\x80\x9d Lou says. \xe2\x80\x9cOne of the critical pieces is Luminar LiDAR. Using that LiDAR, we\xe2\x80\x99re moving one step toward to being ready for mass production, and then we can prepare for large scale production. Luminar LiDAR, compared to our current solution, is more reliable and much cheaper.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLiDAR is a laser sensor that sends millions of laser points out per second and measures how long they take to bounce back, a key component to safe autonomous driving. Luminar says that its Iris LiDAR has a maximum range of 500 meters (1,640 feet), including 250-meter range with less than 10 percent reflectivity. The self-driving sensor solution offers better perception accuracy and field of view breadth to enhance the ability to cope with long-tail scenarios. The new pony vehicles with Luminar\xe2\x80\x99s LiDAR sensor will be up and running in 2022, and will be ready for the company\xe2\x80\x99s robotaxi customers in 2023.\n\nAutonomous driving at scale is, literally, in sight\n\nThe past year hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been easy, Lou says, but it pushed their contactless delivery initiative further along in Irvine, which helped the community cope during the pandemic, while adding testing and collecting mileage for data points. But full autonomy at scale still requires testing.\n\nTo help accelerate their commercial growth and global deployment, they\xe2\x80\x99ve tapped Lawrence Steyn, vice chairman of investment banking at JPMorgan Chase & Co, as chief financial officer.\n\nAnd looking ahead, in 10 years or 20 years, it could be possible that owning a vehicle would entirely be a luxury, Lou says.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe need to carefully think about whether that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary, having personal vehicles,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it\xe2\x80\x99s mathematically possible to get a vehicle within as little as 30 seconds, most people may not have to own a vehicle.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe also points out that if most vehicles are running autonomously, the vehicle form factor can be reshaped for accessibility, opening up safe transportation for a larger population of older and disabled riders who could turn to cheaper, more efficient autonomous transportation for their travel needs.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI still keep the engineering part in me, and with that part, I dream of pushing the world forward with state-of-art technology,\xe2\x80\x9d Peng says. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are working hard to largely scale and deploy our technology across countries and regions to benefit more and more people.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDig deeper.

"376.txt";"b'These Vehicles Can Almost Drive Themselves There is no such thing as a self-driving car. Let\xe2\x80\x99s make that clear right away, not a single car on the road today can operate in all types of weather and driving conditions without any human intervention. That type of vehicle, one with what\xe2\x80\x99s called Level 5 autonomy (which we\'ll explain in further detail later), remains years into the future. This doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean many cars on sale today don\xe2\x80\x99t have impressive technology that\xe2\x80\x99s making them increasingly smarter and safer. Some of these driving aids are targeted at reducing driver stress, by taking over some or all steering functions, or automatically matching the car\xe2\x80\x99s speed to posted road signs. Certain systems, like Cadillac\xe2\x80\x99s Super Cruise, can only be used within specific parameters, such as pre-mapped divided highways with dedicated on- and off-ramps. There are also a number of active safety features, such as automatic emergency braking, that help minimize the risk of an accident by stopping the car if sensors detect an obstacle. While the era of robot cars hasn\xe2\x80\x99t yet arrived, let\xe2\x80\x99s look at examples of self-driving technology available today.\n\n<h3><strong>What Are the Levels of Vehicle Autonomy?</strong></h3> <p>To make things as simple as possible, let\xe2\x80\x99s explain the five levels of vehicle autonomy before we look at the cars and SUVs on this list. The levels of autonomy are determined by SAE International, a professional group of worldwide engineers devoted to establishing standardized values for the transportation field. To better understand self-driving cars, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand each level of autonomy.</p> <p>Level 0 means the car is always under human control. Cars in this category can have active safety features, like automatic emergency braking and forward collision warning, but these features only offer visual or audible alerts, and they never actively control the car.</p> <p>Level 1 vehicles might include adaptive cruise control or lane keep assist. These safety features are capable of providing a small degree of steering, acceleration, or braking input. However, their primary focus is accident avoidance. </p> <p>Level 2 autonomy entails several active safety features working in unison to take some degree of driving duty away from the driver. Onboard cameras and radar sensors could keep the car driving at a steady speed in its intended lane of travel, for example, and clear of surrounding vehicles. At this level you\xe2\x80\x99ll find a number of today\xe2\x80\x99s self-driving systems, such as Cadillac Super Cruise and Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s AutoPilot. One key thing to remember: A Level 2 vehicle requires the driver to remain focused on the road. This can be done via cameras that monitor the driver\xe2\x80\x99s eyes or sensors that can tell if the driver lets go of the steering wheel.</p> <p>At Level 3, a vehicle takes over all driving controls in select conditions and allows the driver to focus elsewhere. These conditions might be specific types of highway, or geofenced locations. The vehicle may not be able to drive itself in poor weather.</p> <p>At Level 4, the self-driving car is able to adapt to more road and weather conditions. The limitations of Level 3 are lessened, and the vehicle theoretically requires almost no driver input.</p> <p>Finally, at Level 5, the car drives all the time, no matter the type of road or weather outside. This robo-car is the end game for self-driving technology, though it remains years into the future.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>2020 Tesla Model S</strong></h3> <p><strong>Price w/ Autonomous Driving Features: $69,420 | U.S. News Overall Score: 9.0/10</strong></p> <p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s start with the car company and electric-powered sedan that put self-driving technology on the map. True, the idea of robo-cars didn\xe2\x80\x99t start with Tesla, but the Silicon Valley-based automaker has put them front and center in terms of cutting-edge car technology. </p> <p>Every <a href=""/cars-trucks/tesla/model-s/2020"">Model S</a> is fitted with Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s AutoPilot self-driving aid, though you can upgrade to the Full Self-Driving Capability package for an extra $8,000. While AutoPilot maintains vehicle speed and keeps the Model S in its intended lane of travel, Full Self-Driving Capability allows for lane changes (if the sensors detect it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to do so), automatic parking assist, and a mode to summon the car from a parking spot. </p> <p>Tesla remains at the forefront of this technology, though the company\xe2\x80\x99s reputation has been dinged by high profile accidents while its vehicles were operating with some degree of autonomy. This has often been linked to driver inattention, though the fact that AutoPilot usage is not geo-fenced to certain roads \xe2\x80\x93 such as the next system we\xe2\x80\x99re going to discuss \xe2\x80\x93 has been a heated safety topic.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>2020 Cadillac CT6</strong></h3> <p><strong>Price w/ Autonomous Driving Features: $74,495 | U.S. News Overall Score: 7.2/10</strong></p> <p>While Tesla has adopted a more free-spirited attitude to self-driving assistance, the Cadillac Super Cruise system takes a more measured approach. Like Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s AutoPilot, when Super Cruise is in operation the car maintains its speed, distance to other vehicles, and adheres to its intended lane of travel. </p> <p>Unlike some rival lane keep assist technology, Super Cruise is credited for being very smooth and avoiding the \xe2\x80\x98ping-pong\xe2\x80\x99 feel that other systems cause as onboard sensors read and respond to lane markings. This is a hands-free system, but a camera in the interior keeps an eye on the driver to make certain they\xe2\x80\x99re looking ahead and paying attention. If that isn\xe2\x80\x99t the case, Super Cruise will issue a series of visual and audible alerts. Should this still not get the driver\xe2\x80\x99s attention, the car will turn on its hazard lights and slow to a stop in its lane of travel.</p> <p>Available on the <a href=""/cars-trucks/cadillac/ct6/2020"">CT6</a> luxury sedan in the Premium Luxury trim level, Super Cruise can only be activated on divided highways with dedicated on-ramps and off-ramps. </p> <p>As of this writing, roughly 130,000 miles of roads throughout North America have been programmed into Super Cruise. For the 2021 model year, this technology will be available in the new <a href=""/cars-trucks/cadillac/escalade/2021"">Escalade</a> full-size SUV, along with the <a href=""/cars-trucks/cadillac/ct4/2020"">CT4</a> and <a href=""/cars-trucks/cadillac/ct5/2020"">CT5</a> sedans.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>2020 Nissan Rogue</strong></h3> <p><strong>Price w/ Autonomous Driving Features: $28,670 | U.S. News Overall Score: 7.6/10</strong></p> <p>Nissan takes a slightly simpler approach with its self-driving technology.

ProPilot offers more of a gentle nudge in corners, though sharper bends will cause it to default back to the driver\'s control. </p> <p>Nissan touts ProPilot Assist as a way to relieve daily driving stresses and it will feature in more models in the years ahead. A more advanced ProPilot Assist 2.0 system is also on the road, though it\xe2\x80\x99s not yet in the U.S. market.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>2020 BMW X7</strong></h3> <p><strong>Price w/ Autonomous Driving Features: $75,600 | U.S. News Overall Score: 7.7/10</strong></p> <p>The <a href=""/cars-trucks/bmw/x7/2020"">BMW X7</a> is the German automaker\xe2\x80\x99s largest SUV and one of several models in which you can order hands-free parallel parking assist, along with traffic jam assist.

"379.txt";"b'While the major automakers are developing autonomous vehicles behind closed doors, we were able to experience Audi\xe2\x80\x99s latest prototype at Las Vegas\xe2\x80\x99 CES show in January. California, Florida, Michigan, and Nevada are the only states, along with Washington, D.C., that currently allow companies to test such vehicles on public roads.\n\nAudi\xe2\x80\x99s A7 test car is equipped with the company\xe2\x80\x99s traffic-jam assist feature, which uses an array of cameras, sensors, and radar to let the car take over the driving in highway traffic. In the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat was Bj\xc3\xb6rn Giesler, Ph.D., project leader for development of piloted driving at Audi AG, and in the backseat was an engineer equipped with a laptop and radio to monitor the system and communicate with our police escorts and other Audi vehicles.\n\nDuring rush-hour traffic, we headed out on Route 15, one of Las Vegas\xe2\x80\x99 major freeways. With the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s speed under 40 mph, a notification appeared that the system\xe2\x80\x99s pilot mode was available. Then with the push of a button on the steering wheel, the car took control and the instrument cluster graphic changed to an illustration of the road with vehicles in the lanes.\n\nAs Giesler took his hands off the wheel and his foot off the pedals, the vehicle seamlessly followed the car in front at a safe distance. When a vehicle cut into our lane, the A7 automatically slowed down and adjusted the distance. When that car moved out of the lane, our car again closed the gap with the next car in front. The driver can turn off the system at any time by placing his hands on the steering wheel and foot back on the pedals.\n\nWith the A7 in control, the driver could do other things, although sleeping was not one of them. The vehicle was equipped with two cameras with facial recognition that monitored the driver\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. Giesler showed off that feature in an unnerving moment. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to lie to you, this is still pretty scary for me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said as he pretended to sleep. After about 10 seconds the vehicle noticed. An audible alert sounded and, when he still didn\xe2\x80\x99t open his eyes, the vehicle shut down in the middle of the highway and activated the hazard lights. That is a safeguard on the prototype A7 in case the driver is ill or incapacitated. But production cars will be designed so that they can make autonomous lane changes, which will allow the vehicle to safely pull off the road.\n\nDuring the demonstration, Giesler pointed out an eye-opening reminder of how quickly the technology is advancing. The previous year the test car\xe2\x80\x99s trunk was filled with three desktop-sized computers to make the system work. This year the hardware had been reduced to the size of a small box, which was tucked away in the trunk\xe2\x80\x99s side storage compartment.\n\nOverall we were quite impressed with the Audi\xe2\x80\x99s capabilities. The company expects the technology to be available in a production car within five years.'";"Autonomous Cars";"379.txt-Autonomous Cars"

The companies said they plan to expand to Austin, Texas, in 2022 and roll out about 1,000 self-driving cars in multiple markets within five years.\n\nThe partnership comes as ride-hailing companies Uber and Lyft ditch their own in-house systems and instead look to outside partners for self-driving technology. Lyft announced plans in April to sell its autonomous vehicle unit to a subsidiary of Toyota for $550 million. In December, Uber sold its self-driving unit to start-up Aurora \xe2\x80\x94 which is backed by Hyundai and Amazon \xe2\x80\x94 amid safety concerns and extreme costs.\n\n""Each company brings the scale, knowledge and capability in their area of expertise that is necessary to make autonomous ride-hailing a business reality,"" said Lyft co-founder and CEO Logan Green.\n\nAs part of the agreement, Lyft will receive 2.5% common equity of Argo AI, the Ford and Volkswagen-backed autonomous vehicle start-up that\'s reportedly preparing to go public as soon as this year.\n\nThe race to deploy self-driving vehicles is heating up nationwide. General Motors CEO Mary Barra said during the company\'s first-quarter earnings call that she expects to offer consumers autonomous vehicles this decade.

The company, a division of Intel (INTC), describes NYC as \xe2\x80\x9cone of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most challenging driving environments\xe2\x80\x9d and says the data from the trial will push full self-driving capability closer to prime time.\n\nIn an interview, Mobileye CEO Amnon Shashua said fully autonomous cars could be in showrooms by the end of President Biden\xe2\x80\x99s first term. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have contracts underway with car makers for the 2024 or 2025 time frame,\xe2\x80\x9d Shashua told Yahoo Finance. \xe2\x80\x9cA level 4 vehicle can be purchased by a consumer at a very, very reasonable add-on cost.\xe2\x80\x9d Level 4 is the second-highest level of vehicle autonomy and it means a driver is never needed.\n\nSystems on the market today, including Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s Autopilot and General Motors\xe2\x80\x99 Supercruise, are Level 2 autonomy, which means computers can control steering and speed but the driver needs to be ready to intervene if necessary. Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s system has been controversial because of several fatal crashes that occurred with Autopilot engaged. Drivers may have mistakenly thought the system could avoid all hazards, which it\xe2\x80\x99s not yet designed to do. The Transportation Department\'s safety agency is investigating at least 30 Tesla crashes involving 10 deaths.\n\nMobileye\xe2\x80\x99s CEO Amnon Shashua poses with a Mobileye driverless vehicle at the Nasdaq Market site in New York, U.S., July 20, 2021.

Tesla is developing its own system. Most automakers, including General Motors (GM) and Ford (F), use proprietary in-house technology along with systems provided by suppliers such as Mobileye. Autonomous vehicles are complex and a handful of sophisticated firms will probably end up dominating the market, which is likely to be lucrative.\n\nShashua sees robotaxis arriving before self-driving cars consumers buy at dealerships. Mobileye, which was an Israeli company before Intel bought it for $15 billion in 2017, has permission to operate driverless taxis in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, most likely by the end of 2022, and in Munich as well.

Robotaxis may also be easier to regulate, through rules governing their use inside a fixed geography such as a city\xe2\x80\x99s boundaries. Driverless cars for consumers probably need the ability to go virtually anywhere, plus some regulatory guidance that isn\xe2\x80\x99t yet fully developed.

"383.txt";"b'The age of autonomous or self-driving cars is slowly creeping up on us and, with each new year that passes, semi-autonomous technology is getting better and better as we inch toward the day when human driving could be outlawed altogether. With that said, a recent report provided by Cox Automotive points out that 84-percent of people surveyed would still prefer the option of driving themselves, leaving just 16-percent of those surveyed willing to give up full control. To make matters worse, the overall acceptance of self-driving technology over the last two years has fallen by 18-percentage points. That probably, at least in part, comes thanks to recent high-profile autonomous car accidents, like the fatal accident with one of Uber\xe2\x80\x99s self-driving cars. As such, it\xe2\x80\x99s not surprising that automakers are scrambling to prove that their autonomous technology is safe \xe2\x80\x93 we can always trust them, right?\n\nIn the video you see below, BMW has chosen one of its autonomous test vehicles with the co-star being none other than a scary-looking ghost in the woods. Naturally, the self-driving car stops in the middle of the road, long before it could run over the scary ghost because, you know, self-driving technology is just that good. As the video proceeds, the ghost opens the car door to find nobody in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat, gets scared, and scurries off into the woods like a very naughty mouse that was caught in your kitchen cupboard. Then we see the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cNOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF\xe2\x80\x9d flash across the screen.\n\nThis video can be seen in one of two ways. The way BMW wants you to see it is that its self-driving technology is so good that it can even stop for a lifeless entity in the middle of a dark wooded road in the middle of the night \xe2\x80\x93 a place where no car (or driver for that matter) really has any business being anyway. That\xe2\x80\x99s great- BMW\xe2\x80\x99s self-driving tech will stop for anything. Not that I\xe2\x80\x99d want my car to stop for a ghost, ghoul, goblin, or any other form of the undead \xe2\x80\x93 can you imagine how useless autonomous cars would be in a zombie apocalypse? Anyway, YAY; it is super safe.\n\nI, on the other hand, look at this video a completely different way. First off, why was this self-driving car in the middle of the darkest, creepiest looking wooded road in the middle of the night? Maybe the car had gone rogue after the passenger stopped to take a leak. A brave soul that would have been. But, I digress. I think the real message here is that even ghosts \xe2\x80\x93 the leftover souls of those that once walked this earth \xe2\x80\x93 are scared of self-driving technology. Now, that, my friends, is something to take note of. If a creepy ghost walking down a dark road in the middle of the night, with clear intentions of scaring the hell out of someone, is scared of self-driving cars, then shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we be scared of them as well?

"386.txt";"b'TOKYO -- Prices of one key type of the sensors used in autonomous cars are falling rapidly, raising hopes of accelerating progress in the development of self-driving technology.\n\nVelodyne Lidar, the leading manufacturer of lidar sensors, has developed a product with a price only one-hundredth of those up until now. This dramatic drop in price for the sensors at the heart of many autonomous car designs could rev up the speed of the evolution of self-driving vehicles.\n\nMost of today\'s autonomous vehicles are equipped with two key types of sensors: cameras and radars.\n\nSensors using lidar (light detection and ranging) work like radar systems, with the only difference being that they use laser light instead of radio waves.\n\nLidar technology uses near-infrared light to detect objects around a vehicle. The advantage of lidar is that it can generate precise three-dimensional images of everything from cars to traffic lights to pedestrians in a wide range of environments and under diverse lighting conditions.\n\nHonda Motor\'s new self-driving Legend luxury sedan, equipped with the world\'s first certified Level 3 autonomous driving technology, uses lidar sensors.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk, however, has famously disparaged lidar sensors, saying in 2019 that they are ""expensive sensors that are unnecessary"" and likening them to ""a whole bunch of expensive appendices.""\n\nMusk has shown such distaste for lidar technology mainly because lidar sensors have been so costly, with a system for one vehicle costing as much as $70,000. He has argued that sophisticated cameras are sufficient for self-driving cars\' vision systems.\n\nIndeed, the biggest hurdle to widespread lidar adoption has been an economic one.\n\nBut technological innovation has significantly undermined the assumption underlying Musk\'s argument.\n\nVelodyne CEO Anand Gopalan told Nikkei that Musk\'s view of lidar technology is ""five, six years out of date.""\n\nGopalan asked whether it is wise to rely on just one component for safety. ""If you\'re driving at 70 miles per hour, or 100 kilometers per hour, you\'re taking your hand off the steering wheel and you\'re shutting your brain off ... can you rely on just one sensor?"" he said.\n\nAs the costs of lidar sensors decline, they can be combined with cameras to create truly safe and affordable vision systems, he asserted. ""If lidar can become small and low-cost, [it will help] create a safe system.""\n\nMany major carmakers have apparently agreed. Velodyne\'s customer list includes Volkswagen and Honda.\n\nVelodyne CEO Anand Gopalan holds the company\'s new palm-size lidar unit.\n\nWhen Google initially started its autonomous vehicle research, it used custom-made lidar sensors from Velodyne. They were rotating models mounted on the roof.\n\nVelodyne has sharply reduced lidar production costs by developing solid-state lidars. This new approach has helped shrink the size of the sensors, eliminate moving parts in the optical mechanisms and enable the kind of mass manufacturing that has brought costs down.\n\nThe company\'s new model, its smallest so far, could be sold at around $100 in high-volume production. A sensor system composed of multiple lidars is capable of 360-degree vehicle coverage.\n\nAs the costs of making lidars fall further through mass production, the total cost of lidars per vehicle will likely fall sharply. ""Past 2025, I think you will see the cost of lidars come down even more, in the $700 range"" per vehicle, Gopalan said.\n\nLuminar Technologies, a U.S. vehicle sensor and software startup, has also developed low-priced lidar sensors priced at $500 to $1,000.\n\nLuminar\'s high-performance lidar sensors can accurately detect objects ahead of the car out to 250 meters away and grasp the situation around the vehicle with a perception accuracy of several centimeters. The sensors can also detect dark objects, like black debris or a person wearing black clothes, even on roads with minimum reflectivity.\n\nGermany\'s Daimler, Sweden\'s Volvo Cars, the Israel-based Intel unit Mobileye and Toyota Motor\'s research arm have adopted Luminar\'s lidar sensors for their self-driving prototypes.\n\nLuminar CEO Austin Russell stresses the crucial importance of focusing on safety in developing self-driving technologies. One accident per 100 people is not acceptable, Russell told Nikkei. The goal should be ""to have 99.99999999% -- 10 nines of reliability,"" he said.\n\nRussell was a child prodigy who memorized the whole periodic table at age 2 and made a cellphone on his own while he was an elementary school student. He obtained a patent for a water recycling system he invented when he was 13.\n\nUnder the guidance of billionaire Peter Thiel, a co-founder of PayPal, Russell founded Luminar at the age of 17. Following Luminar\'s listing on Nasdaq in December 2020 through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) -- a shell company that uses the proceeds from an IPO to acquire a private company -- he became a billionaire at age 25.\n\nBesides Luminar, more than five other U.S. lidar startups, including California-based Aeva, have gone public via a SPAC merger.\n\nIn recent years, progress in autonomous driving technology has been markedly slower than that for electric vehicles. One reason has been a rush of major automakers to expand their EV offerings in response to a global trend toward stricter regulatory restrictions on gasoline-powered cars aimed at reducing carbon emissions.\n\nAs their earnings have been battered by the COVID-19 pandemic, carmakers have concentrated their investment on electric vehicles while cutting their R&D spending on self-driving technology.\n\nThe walls of national regulations and high costs have also hampered the advancement of autonomous driving technology. But growing competition among Velodyne and its rivals to develop more accurate and less expensive lidar sensors could help the technology overcome these challenges and come into widespread use.\n\n""Various parts with falling prices, such as sensors and cameras, will help remedy shortcomings [of autonomous driving],"" said professor Toshio Ito at the Shibaura Institute of Technology, an expert in advanced driver assistance systems.\n\nA small number of players, mainly U.S. and Chinese tech companies, are dominating the self-driving business landscape due primarily to its high technological and financial hurdles.\n\nGeneral Motors\' autonomous driving subsidiary, GM Cruise; Waymo, which began as Google\'s self-driving car project; and China\'s Baidu are leading the pack in terms of testing self-driving cars on public roads in California and other parts of the U.S. They have covered far more distance than Daimler or Toyota.\n\nIn a notable strategic move by another tech giant, Amazon acquired the autonomous vehicle startup Zoox to develop driverless delivery vehicles.\n\nApple is another tech powerhouse that is raising its self-driving profile. Since 2017, the Palo Alto, California-based company has been test-driving its own models on public roads around its headquarters. According to documents the company submitted in the past to the state authority, Apple has been testing a Lexus-based self-driving vehicle. A Lexus equipped with self-driving systems provided by DeepRoute.ai, a Chinese company, has been spotted in the area.\n\nVelodyne\'s Gopalan welcomes entries by tech companies like those affiliated with Google\'s parent, Alphabet, and Apple into the mobility sector.\n\n""Their appetite to adopt new technologies like lidar ... is much faster than a traditional automotive [manufacturer]. And so their entry into the space has really forced the rest of the industry to innovate,"" he said.\n\nThese U.S. and Chinese tech companies, armed with not just accumulated test-driving data but also ample financial and human resources, are likely to remain on the leading edge of the self-driving revolution.'";"Autonomous Cars";"386.txt-Autonomous Cars"

"390.txt";"b'Friday, June 25, 2021\n\nDespite all the hype, fully self-driving cars are not yet commercially available to the public. In limited geographical areas, individuals can sometimes be passengers in these vehicles. However, mastering the technology behind these cars has proven highly costly, and a wider rollout has taken much longer than expected.\n\nEven Tesla, who offers an \xe2\x80\x9cAutopilot\xe2\x80\x9d feature and boasts that their cars can run by themselves, admits (sometimes) that there needs to be a human at the controls. This is partly because of the accidents that continue to occur when people allow the car to do what it promises to do: drive itself. Clearly, safety continues to be a significant concern.\n\nIn April of this year, a Tesla vehicle was involved in a fatal crash that killed two people. Just before the drive, eyewitnesses said that the parties left to test-drive the vehicle without a driver utilizing Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s Autopilot feature.\n\nTesla claims the accident occurred because there was no one behind the wheel. The company says they include a warning on when and where to use this feature in the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s manual. They also state on their website that active driver supervision is required, yet they continue to advertise the Autopilot feature as autonomous.\n\nSo, before we examine who\xe2\x80\x99s at fault if you\xe2\x80\x99re involved in an accident with a driverless car, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand the complexities surrounding self-driving cars, from what defines the term to current regulations and the latest developments in the industry.\n\nWHAT ARE SELF-DRIVING VEHICLES?\n\nThe terms \xe2\x80\x9cself-driving,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdriverless,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cautonomous\xe2\x80\x9d are often used synonymously, although there are important distinctions.\n\nSelf-driving vehicles have been assigned levels of autonomy by the NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration). Most cars on the road today operate at Level 1, where there are some autonomous functions such as cruise control or Lane-Keep Assist. It\xe2\x80\x99s worth noting that the NHTSA recently updated their descriptions of Levels 4 and 5 to include a greater degree of autonomy and lack of human intervention.\n\nThere has been some reluctance for people to grab onto the self-driving concept. However, according to forecaster Scott Hardman, as driving becomes more automated, people will drive more, based on his interviews with 35 Tesla BEV with Autopilot owners. Those interviewed perceived less stress and increased comfort associated with partial automation.\n\nIn the meantime, technology is moving forward amidst hope, some trepidation, and, most of all, confusion.\n\nESSENTIAL SELF-DRIVING VEHICLE STATS\n\nExact statistics about driverless vehicles are difficult to get due to the lack of mandates on reporting accidents and the lack of industry-wide standards, where confusion abounds. Nevertheless, here are some important numbers worth considering:\n\nMore than 80 companies are testing over 1,400 self-driving cars in the U.S.\n\nAbout half of the population familiar with self-driving cars say they would be willing to ride in them.\n\nThe Tsukuba Mechanical Engineering Laboratory in Japan launched the first primitive, semi-automated car in 1977.\n\nGoogle\xe2\x80\x99s self-driving car first crashed into a bus in February of 2016; there were no injuries.\n\nTesla autonomous vehicles have been involved in several accidents. The first accident that resulted in death occurred in Florida on May 7, 2016.\n\nThe first Uber self-driving car crash occurred on November 20, 2018, in Tempe, Arizona. The cause was human error and resulted in the death of pedestrian Elaine Hezerberg.\n\nUber was involved in 37 crashes prior to the fatal accident in 2018.\n\nWaymo, the self-driving division of Google parent company Alphabet, Inc., partnered with the trucking giant J.B. Hunt and began hauling commercial loads on Texas highways with Level 4 autonomous big-rig vehicles in March of 2020.\n\nWaymo has also been running a driverless taxi service in the Phoenix, Arizona area since 2018. In May of this year, one of these Waymo taxis got confused in Chandler, Arizona traffic and took off on its own. Fortunately, no one was injured.\n\nLyft predicts autonomous rides could arrive by 2023.\n\nMany experts say driverless cars are safer than those driven entirely by human operators. Regardless, accidents have occurred and will continue to take place for many reasons. But if you\xe2\x80\x99re involved in a driverless car accident, who\xe2\x80\x99s at fault? Do you have any recourse?\n\nWHO\xe2\x80\x99S TO BLAME IN A CRASH?\n\nThe blame, or cause, of the accident, can be murky at best and may rest with more than one party. That\xe2\x80\x99s why it is essential to have a professional and experienced personal injury attorney on your side to accurately assess the situation, interpret the data, and consult the right experts to support your case and present it properly to the court.\n\nWHAT TO DO IF YOU\xe2\x80\x99RE IN AN ACCIDENT WITH A DRIVERLESS CAR\n\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re involved in an accident of any kind, you\xe2\x80\x99ll want to seek medical help as soon as possible.

Called a safety operator, the human ""has a red button that can stop the vehicle just in case anything happens,"" Pony.ai CEO James Peng told the Reuters news agency.\n\nThe operator will be removed next year when Pony.ai, whose investors include Toyota Motor Corp., sends out its driverless vehicles in some areas of California. Still, an operator will supervise vehicles from a distance and give help when the vehicles run into trouble, Peng said.\n\nCruise is majority-owned by General Motors. It started operating five driverless vehicles in San Francisco at night in October 2020. A human was in the front seat. The person has ""the ability to stop the vehicle at any point during the ride,"" a Cruise spokesman told Reuters.\n\n""Cruise views the development of self-driving vehicles as not only a tech race, but also a trust race,\xe2\x80\x9d the spokesman said. He added that humans help with safe driverless vehicle development and help ""build trust with the public.""\n\nIn the face of many technical and legal difficulties, some self-driving companies are accepting the need for human minders. The goal is to make money in the near future, investors and startup executives say.\n\nTesla Inc. recently launched a new test version of what it calls \xe2\x80\x9cFull Self-Driving"" software. The company said in a message to owners that drivers should ""be prepared to act immediately, especially around blind corners, crossing intersections, and in narrow driving situations.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nU.S. safety officials have opened an investigation into the automaker\'s Autopilot driver assistance system following several accidents.\n\nOfficials are also keeping humans involved with automated vehicles.\n\nIn a statement to Reuters, the California Department of Motor Vehicles said state laws ""call for a two-way communication link that allows the manufacturer to continuously monitor the (driverless) vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d location and status.\n\nOther companies are using remote operation \xe2\x80\x93 operating vehicles from a distance - as a way to get vehicles on the road.\n\nIn Las Vegas, startup Halo allows customers to call a driverless car, which is driven by a remote human operator over wireless networks operated by T-Mobile US Inc.\n\nElliot Katz is co-founder of teleoperation company Phantom Auto.\n\n""Just a few years back, remote human assistance was a dirty little secret in this space,"" Katz said.\n\nKatz suggested many developers hoped for vehicles that drove without any human assistance, doing \xe2\x80\x9ceverything that a human driver would do.""\n\nHe added: ""Everyone now knows that\'s not going to be the case.""\n\nI\'m John Russell.\n\nHyunjoo Jin and Nathan Frandino reported on this story for Reuters.

"392.txt";"b'Last summer, I asked (with a hint of frustration) where my totally self-driving car was. After all, it was 2020, and I had accumulated a slew of statements from years past that promised millions of them would be on the road by then.\n\nNow, we\xe2\x80\x99re well into 2021, and I\xe2\x80\x99m starting to get discouraged.\n\nFirst, Christopher Mims of The Wall Street Journal reported a few weeks ago that some experts now say, despite an accumulated investment of more than $80 billion toward research and technology, that \xe2\x80\x9cwe may never get the self-driving cars we were promised.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThen, I spoke to an expert I\xe2\x80\x99ve known for years, who told me basically the same thing.\n\nActually, that\xe2\x80\x99s not entirely true. Francesco Biondi did tell me we might see such a car, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I think it will probably be toward the end of my lifetime.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe is 33. I don\xe2\x80\x99t stand a chance.\n\nAll those dreams I had of a car that would take me to doctor appointments in my old age, drop me off at the door, park itself, then come get me when I was done? Poof! Up in smoke, like so many semi-autonomous cars that run into things.\n\nBiondi used to be an assistant professor at the University of Utah, where he conducted tests on volunteers who drove back and forth to Wendover in semi-autonomous cars. They drove one way manually and let the car handle much of the driving in the other direction. They wore contraptions that measured brain waves and had video recorders trained on them, which eventually demonstrated that people tend to lose focus when their cars automatically stay in their lanes and brake for traffic ahead.\n\nWhich is a problem, because those cars aren\xe2\x80\x99t really ready to drive themselves.\n\nIn other words, it\xe2\x80\x99s more dangerous to drive today\xe2\x80\x99s semi-autonomous cars than to pilot that old, dusty beater that requires you to do everything \xe2\x80\x94 brake, accelerate, turn, switch on the radio and watch out for the other guy \xe2\x80\x94 all by yourself.\n\nIf your beater has a manual transmission, you don\xe2\x80\x99t even have a hand free to text while driving.\n\nRelated Legislature approves bill allowing driverless cars on Utah roads\n\nToday, Biondi is a fully tenured assistant professor at the University of Windsor, in Canada. His window lets him look across the river toward Detroit, which once was the symbol of America\xe2\x80\x99s booming automobile industry. He\xe2\x80\x99s still very much involved in similar research.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think that the industry assumed it would be much easier,\xe2\x80\x9d he said about self-driving cars. The reason they were wrong is something that ought to make all of us feel proud:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs much as we like to think that humans are not as smart as machines \xe2\x80\xa6 that\xe2\x80\x99s far from being the case. Even after years of testing, autonomous cars are unable to match the human driver\xe2\x80\x99s performances. There are a lot of scenarios \xe2\x80\x94 weather conditions, road conditions \xe2\x80\x94 where these cars are not as smart as we want them to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSo, rogue machines aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to take over the world any time soon. That\xe2\x80\x99s good news, even though it won\xe2\x80\x99t help me get to the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s office as an old man.\n\nAnd yet that message doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be widespread knowledge. At least, that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the case last April in Texas when two men decided to go for a ride in a Tesla, with one apparently in the back seat and the other in the front passenger seat \xe2\x80\x94 and no one behind the wheel.\n\nThe New York Times said their wives overheard the men talking about the car\xe2\x80\x99s autopilot features as they left. They died when the car left the road on a steep turn.\n\nBiondi said evidence shows many people who buy semi-autonomous cars overestimate what they can do. Dealerships sometimes oversell the products or leave out information about limitations.\n\nMims, of The Wall Street Journal, suggests some experts think the whole idea needs to be rethought. They want to approach the necessary artificial intelligence by building systems that learn the way human babies do. Others want to divide the problem into smaller chunks, developing systems that each handle a piece of the puzzle.\n\nBiondi said he thinks commercial trucking shows more promise at the moment, especially if it involves dedicating lanes of traffic for that use only.\n\nTo me, it all sounds long and laborious and so \xe2\x80\xa6 well \xe2\x80\xa6 20th century.\n\nIt also sounds like I\xe2\x80\x99d better be prepared for that day when, as with my Dad and those before him, the kids discreetly take my keys from me and, in my decrepit state, I have to bum a ride to the doctor. What a bother.\n\nJay Evensen is a senior columnist for Deseret News.'";"Autonomous Cars";"392.txt-Autonomous Cars"
"393.txt";"b'The most remarkable thing about a ride in a robot car is how unremarkable it is.\n\nIt is definitely eerie to see the steering wheel turn by itself, the car brake and change lanes without human intervention. But just as with cruise control, it soon feels commonplace.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been covering autonomous driving for several years so I\xe2\x80\x99ve taken lots of these rides \xe2\x80\x94 often carefully choreographed to show the cars to best advantage.\n\nFive years ago, I perched nervously in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat of a self-driving Uber Ford Fusion in Pittsburgh, ready to take the wheel as it crisscrossed the city\xe2\x80\x99s notorious bridges. I chugged around the campus of Santa Clara University in a converted golf cart from Auro Robotics, and barreled down Interstate 280 in a self-driving big rig from Otto. Alongside Zoox co-founder Jesse Levinson, who narrated the trip like a proud parent, I wound through narrow San Francisco streets in 2018. Scientists at Stanford University, UC Berkeley and Nissan Research Center told me how they are facilitating communication between robot cars and humans.\n\nWednesday\xe2\x80\x99s jaunt in Waymo\xe2\x80\x99s self-driving Jaguar I-Pace had no surprises. The car smoothly glided to a stop at intersections and signaled before turns. The closest thing to a hiccup was a slight jerkiness when it pulled over to drop off us faux ride-hailing passengers. The company confined our 20-minute test drive to the wide, relatively empty streets of the Sunset District, avoiding the hills and traffic elsewhere in the city, so the car didn\xe2\x80\x99t face any challenges. Ever Guardado, our safety driver, never needed to assume control, but did so once at my request just to demonstrate the tones the car sounds when a driver takes over.\n\nFour years ago when I rode in an earlier-generation Waymo robot car at its testing site on a former military base in Merced County, Waymo staged several complex situations: a bicyclist pedaling alongside, a pedestrian wandering into the crosswalk, a car abruptly cutting off the robot car and boxes sprawling into the road. That robot car, which did not have a person behind the wheel, adapted quickly to all the tests thrown at it.\n\nWaymo, an arm of Google parent Alphabet, now has the distinction of running San Francisco\xe2\x80\x99s first robot taxi service for the public, albeit with backup drivers behind the wheel and limits on how many folks it will accept into its testing program.\n\nJessica Christian/The Chronicle\n\nFleets of robot taxis are how Waymo, Cruise, Zoox and other main contenders in the self-driving race hope to eventually recoup their investors\xe2\x80\x99 multibillion-dollar investments.\n\nWhy test robot taxis in San Francisco?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a major ride-hailing market with a lot of demand from residents,\xe2\x80\x9d said spokesperson Julianne McGoldrick. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the toughest environments for driving \xe2\x80\x94 weather, traffic, road grade, cyclists.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn other words, if a robot car can make it here, it can make it anywhere. That\xe2\x80\x99s also the philosophy of several of Waymo\xe2\x80\x99s competitors, notably GM spin-off Cruise, whose white Chevy Bolts are a common sight on city streets.\n\nWaymo is far along on robot taxis in Phoenix, a much easier city to navigate. It\xe2\x80\x99s given rides to selected testers since 2017, jettisoned the backup drivers since 2019 and now, for almost a year, has been giving hundreds of fully autonomous paid rides \xe2\x80\x94 sans backup driver \xe2\x80\x94 every week to any member of the public who summons one via the Waymo One app, which works pretty much like any other ride-hailing app.\n\nEven when there\xe2\x80\x99s no driver in the car, Waymo has operations specialists who monitor the rides via cameras on the dashboard and the back seat. At a ride\xe2\x80\x99s onset, they check that passengers are buckled up and haven\xe2\x80\x99t brought more than three people along. Riders can talk to them by pressing a button on the app or on a console in the back seat.\n\nJessica Christian/The Chronicle\n\nFor now San Francisco rides are free \xe2\x80\x94 Waymo doesn\xe2\x80\x99t yet have permission to charge a fee. And although it\xe2\x80\x99s had permission since 2018 to ditch backup drivers in California, it has not yet done so. Rival Cruise has been testing some cars without backup drivers in San Francisco for nine months.\n\nBut McGoldrick said its trajectory here to fully autonomous paid rides will be quicker than that in Phoenix.\n\nBack in 2016, lots of smart people said fully autonomous cars would be ubiquitous by 2020. AI researchers told me that their then-toddler-aged kids would never get driver\xe2\x80\x99s licenses.\n\nBut the prospect of robot cars \xe2\x80\x94 and the promise that they\xe2\x80\x99ll improve transportation, end traffic fatalities and reduce congestion \xe2\x80\x94 has stayed tantalizingly out of reach.\n\nAir Quality Tracker Check levels down to the neighborhood Ratings for the Bay Area and California, updated every 10 minutes\n\nThe technology got very far along \xe2\x80\x94 but not all the way. The public got disenchanted, especially after an Uber self-driving car struck and killed a pedestrian in 2018. Companies like Uber and Lyft sold off their self-driving units as the industry consolidated.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe low-hanging fruit in this field is some combination of slow speeds, simple environments and semi-supervised operations,\xe2\x80\x9d Bryant Walker Smith, a longtime industry observer and affiliate scholar at the Stanford Law School Center for Internet and Society, said in an email. \xe2\x80\x9cWaymo and Cruise have long been more interested in moon shots.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJessica Christian/The Chronicle\n\nThose companies need to find \xe2\x80\x9csweet spots that are both technically and financially feasible,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, noting that while Phoenix is technically much easier than the Bay Area, it\xe2\x80\x99s also much less lucrative.\n\nCurrent ride-hailing has low expenses, he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAn Uber trip is basically just a poorly paid driver in a midtier car.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut the robot car fleets, even though they eliminated the labor expenses, have to cover costs for cars that mount up to several hundred thousand dollars each, \xe2\x80\x9cas well as a vast infrastructure for remote human monitoring and support.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTV and movies are replete with far-out images of the future. But I was most struck by a low-tech image in the comedy-drama series \xe2\x80\x9cCasual.\xe2\x80\x9d The final season, which aired in 2018, purportedly took place a couple of years in the future. How the show signaled that: Lead actress Michaela Watkins arrived at her home in a ride-hailing vehicle. The camera briefly panned to show that no one was in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat.\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of naturally interwoven use of robot cars that futurists \xe2\x80\x94 and Waymo, Cruise, etc. \xe2\x80\x94 are betting on.\n\nCarolyn Said is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Oh, and that pedestrian looks as if he might jaywalk in front of you, and that guy in the SUV sure is riding your rear bumper\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nOdds are you\xe2\x80\x99ll do just fine. You\xe2\x80\x99ll make the right adjustments in braking and accelerating, picking just the right moment to go in and out of your lane, all while carrying on a conversation with your passenger.\n\nGenerally, human drivers do relatively well with this kind of complexity. We\xe2\x80\x99re able to respond to the out-of-the-ordinary intuitively.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOn the other hand, we get bored, tired, and easily distracted. Even with all the improvements in automotive safety over the years and depressed vehicle miles traveled from the COVID-19 pandemic, an estimated 38,000 Americans died on the roads in 2020.\n\nAutonomous vehicles have long been promised as the solution, with their sensors that see far ahead in all kinds of weather and their ever-vigilant computers that follow the rules of the road with hyper focus.\n\nBut the reality is more complex. As often happens with new technologies, some challenges are harder than they seemed at first. In fact, the industry is going through a bit of a reset, with companies like Uber and Lyft selling their autonomous vehicle units.\n\nWhy is autonomy hard? The roadways are highly cluttered with many sizes and shapes of obstacles; various objects move in and out quickly and unpredictably; and human behavior is difficult for a machine to predict. Whenever people \xe2\x80\x9cact naturally\xe2\x80\x9d during an odd scenario, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good time to worry about autonomous vehicles.\n\nFor a long time, the answer appeared to be to let an autonomous vehicle do the bulk of the driving, but only with a human behind the wheel, ready to take over in case of failure. The best of both worlds, right?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nUnfortunately, no.\n\nResearch has shown that humans make poor safety drivers. By the time they gain situational awareness in an emergency, it\xe2\x80\x99s often too late to react. In fact, relying upon \xe2\x80\x9chuman fallback\xe2\x80\x9d might actually be more dangerous than fully automated systems.\n\nFurther, the approach of using virtual simulations to prove system safety is facing a harsh reality: The endlessly complex environment, coupled with constantly evolving hardware and software, means that relying upon systems to drive millions of simulated miles, while necessary, is insufficient.\n\nSo, the promise of widely deployed self-driving vehicles remains elusive.\n\nWe still think it\xe2\x80\x99s likely that highly automated vehicles, in some form and performing certain tasks, will become a reality. Where we first see these systems on the roads is uncertain: Maybe electric vehicles \xe2\x80\x94 cheaper to produce than complex gas vehicles \xe2\x80\x94 will include expensive autonomous systems; or maybe autonomous freight trucks on highways may have the right economic incentives for autonomy adoption.\n\nRegardless of which operational model succeeds, we believe there are four major steps we can take in the short term:\n\nLet autonomous vehicles communicate with one another through connected vehicle technology \xe2\x80\x94 The world is a complex place for autonomous vehicles. Weather makes it hard to virtually \xe2\x80\x9csee\xe2\x80\x9d with sensors; emergency responders alter the roadways to make accident scenes safe; and people around the vehicle are hidden by buildings and foliage. Any technology that simplifies this world is crucial to fast and safe adoption of these capabilities. Connected vehicle technology lets these systems \xe2\x80\x9ctalk\xe2\x80\x9d with each other and with the world around them, sharing information about traffic, objects, and intended vehicle paths. To make this vision a reality, industry and the government must come together to implement and standardize these communications, as well as invest in necessary infrastructure.\n\nThe world is a complex place for autonomous vehicles.

"395.txt";"b""Self-driving cars are being developed by several major technology companies and carmakers. credit: VCG/Getty\n\nWhen a driver slams on the brakes to avoid hitting a pedestrian crossing the road illegally, she is making a moral decision that shifts risk from the pedestrian to the people in the car. Self-driving cars might soon have to make such ethical judgments on their own \xe2\x80\x94 but settling on a universal moral code for the vehicles could be a thorny task, suggests a survey of 2.3 million people from around the world.\n\nThe largest ever survey of machine ethics1, published today in Nature, finds that many of the moral principles that guide a driver\xe2\x80\x99s decisions vary by country. For example, in a scenario in which some combination of pedestrians and passengers will die in a collision, people from relatively prosperous countries with strong institutions were less likely to spare a pedestrian who stepped into traffic illegally.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople who think about machine ethics make it sound like you can come up with a perfect set of rules for robots, and what we show here with data is that there are no universal rules,\xe2\x80\x9d says Iyad Rahwan, a computer scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge and a co-author of the study.\n\nThe survey, called the Moral Machine, laid out 13 scenarios in which someone\xe2\x80\x99s death was inevitable. Respondents were asked to choose who to spare in situations that involved a mix of variables: young or old, rich or poor, more people or fewer.\n\nPeople rarely encounter such stark moral dilemmas, and some critics question whether the scenarios posed in the quiz are relevant to the ethical and practical questions surrounding driverless cars. But the study\xe2\x80\x99s authors say that the scenarios stand in for the subtle moral decisions that drivers make every day. They argue that the findings reveal cultural nuances that governments and makers of self-driving cars must take into account if they want the vehicles to gain public acceptance.\n\nAt least one company working on self-driving cars \xe2\x80\x94 the German carmaker Audi \xe2\x80\x94 says that the survey could help prompt an important discussion about these issues. (Other firms with autonomous-vehicle programmes, including auto manufacturer Toyota and technology companies Waymo and Uber, declined to comment on the findings.) And Nicholas Christakis, a social scientist at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, is fascinated by the results.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a remarkable paper,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. The debate about whether ethics are universal or vary between cultures is an old one, says Christakis, and now the \xe2\x80\x9ctwenty-first century problem\xe2\x80\x9d of how to programme self-driving cars has reinvigorated it.\n\nThe road not taken\n\nSome of the world\xe2\x80\x99s biggest tech companies \xe2\x80\x94 including Google's parent, Alphabet; Uber; and Tesla \xe2\x80\x94 and carmakers now have self-driving car programmes. Many of these companies argue that the vehicles could improve road safety, ease traffic and improve fuel efficiency. Social scientists say the cars raise ethical issues, and could have unintended consequences for public safety and the environment.\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nIn 2016, Rahwan\xe2\x80\x99s team stumbled on an ethical paradox about self-driving cars2: in surveys, people said that they wanted an autonomous vehicle to protect pedestrians even if it meant sacrificing its passengers \xe2\x80\x94 but also that they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t buy self-driving vehicles programmed to act this way.\n\nCurious to see if the prospect of self-driving cars might raise other ethical condundrums, Rahwan gathered an international team of psychologists, anthropologists and economists to create the Moral Machine. Within 18 months, the online quiz had recorded 40 million decisions made by people from 233 countries and territories.\n\nNo matter their age, gender or country of residence, most people spared humans over pets, and groups of people over individuals. These responses are in line with rules proposed in what may be the only governmental guidance on self-driving cars: a 2017 report by the German Ethics Commission on Automated and Connected Driving.\n\nBut agreement ends there. When the authors analysed answers from people in the 130 countries with at least 100 respondents, they found that the nations could be divided into three groups. One contains North America and several European nations where Christianity has historically been the dominant religion; another includes countries such as Japan, Indonesia and Pakistan, with strong Confucian or Islamic traditions. A third group consists of Central and South America, as well as France and former French colonies. The first group showed a stronger preference for sacrificing older lives to save younger ones than did the second group, for example.\n\nThe researchers also identified correlations between social and economic factors in a country and the average opinions of its residents. The team found that people from countries with strong government institutions, such as Finland and Japan, more often chose to hit people who were crossing the road illegally than did respondents in nations with weaker institutions, such as Nigeria or Pakistan.\n\nScenarios that forced survey participants to choose whether to save a homeless person on one side of the road or an executive on the other revealed another point of departure: the choices people made often correlated with the level of economic inequality in their culture. People from Finland \xe2\x80\x94 which has a relatively small gap between the rich and the poor \xe2\x80\x94 showed little preference for swerving one way or the other. But the average respondent from Colombia \xe2\x80\x94 a country with significant economic disparity \xe2\x80\x94 chose to kill the lower-status person.\n\nAzim Shariff, a psychologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, finds this result interesting because it suggests that the survey really does reveal people\xe2\x80\x99s moral preferences. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you assume that places that have a lower level of income inequality have political policies that favor egalitarianism, this shows that the moral norms that support those policies are expressed in the way that people play these games.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPotholes ahead?\n\nAlthough autonomous vehicles aren't yet for sale to the public, test versions are cruising through several US cities. By 2021, at least five manufacturers hope to have self-driving cars and trucks in wide use.\n\nBryant Walker Smith, a law professor at the University of South Carolina in Columbia, is sceptical that the Moral Machine survey will have any practical use. He says that the study is unrealistic because there are few instances in real life in which a vehicle would face a choice between striking two different types of people. \xe2\x80\x9cI might as well worry about how automated cars will deal with asteroid strikes,\xe2\x80\x9d Walker Smith says.\n\nBut the study\xe2\x80\x99s authors say that their scenarios represent the minor moral judgements that human drivers make routinely \xe2\x80\x94 which can sometimes be fatal. A driver who veers away from cyclists riding on a curvy mountain road increases her chance of hitting an oncoming vehicle. If the number of driverless cars on the road increases, so too will the likelihood that they will be involved in such accidents.\n\nSome car companies are listening. Barbara Wege, who heads a group focused on autonomous-vehicle ethics at Audi in Ingolstadt, Germany, says such studies are valuable. Wege argues that self-driving cars would cause fewer accidents, proportionally, than human drivers do each year \xe2\x80\x94 but that events involving robots might receive more attention.\n\nSurveys such as the Moral Machine can help to begin public discussions about these inevitable accidents that might foster trust. \xe2\x80\x9cWe need to come up with a social consensus,\xe2\x80\x9d she says, \xe2\x80\x9cabout which risks we are willing to take.\xe2\x80\x9d""";"Autonomous Cars";"395.txt-Autonomous Cars"
"396.txt";"b""B Y THE AGE of seven months, most children have learned that objects still exist even when they are out of sight. Put a toy under a blanket and a child that old will know it is still there, and that he can reach underneath the blanket to get it back. This understanding, of \xe2\x80\x9cobject permanence\xe2\x80\x9d, is a normal developmental milestone, as well as a basic tenet of reality.\n\nListen to this story Your browser does not support the <audio> element. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.\n\nIt is also something that self-driving cars do not have. And that is a problem. Autonomous vehicles are getting better, but they still don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the world in the way that a human being does. For a self-driving car, a bicycle that is momentarily hidden by a passing van is a bicycle that has ceased to exist.\n\nThis failing is basic to the now-widespread computing discipline that has arrogated to itself the slightly misleading moniker of artificial intelligence ( AI ). Current AI works by building up complex statistical models of the world, but it lacks a deeper understanding of reality. How to give AI at least some semblance of that understanding\xe2\x80\x94the reasoning ability of a seven-month-old child, perhaps\xe2\x80\x94is now a matter of active research.\n\nModern AI is based on the idea of machine learning. If an engineer wants a computer to recognise a stop sign, he does not try to write thousands of lines of code that describe every pattern of pixels which could possibly indicate such a sign. Instead, he writes a program that can learn for itself, and then shows that program thousands of pictures of stop signs. Over many repetitions, the program gradually works out what features all of these pictures have in common.\n\nSimilar techniques are used to train self-driving cars to operate in traffic. Cars thus learn how to obey lane markings, avoid other vehicles, hit the brakes at a red light and so on. But they do not understand many things a human driver takes for granted\xe2\x80\x94that other cars on the road have engines and four wheels, or that they obey traffic regulations (usually) and the laws of physics (always). And they do not understand object permanence.\n\nIn a recent paper in Artificial Intelligence, Mehul Bhatt of Orebro University, in Sweden, who is also the founder of a firm called CoDesign Lab which is developing his ideas commercially, describes a different approach. He and his colleagues took some existing AI programs which are used by self-driving cars and bolted onto them a piece of software called a symbolic-reasoning engine.\n\nThe heart has its reasons...\n\nInstead of approaching the world probabilistically, as machine learning does, this software was programmed to apply basic physical concepts to the output of the programs that process signals from an autonomous vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s sensors. This modified output was then fed to the software which drives the vehicle. The concepts involved included the ideas that discrete objects continue to exist over time, that they have spatial relationships with one another\xe2\x80\x94such as \xe2\x80\x9cin-front-of\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbehind\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and that they can be fully or partly visible, or completely hidden by another object.\n\nAnd it worked. In tests, if one car momentarily blocked the sight of another, the reasoning-enhanced software could keep track of the blocked car, predict where and when it would reappear, and take steps to avoid it if necessary. The improvement was not huge. On standard tests Dr Bhatt\xe2\x80\x99s system scored about 5% better than existing software. But it proved the principle. And it also yielded something else. For, unlike a machine-learning algorithm, a reasoning engine can tell you the reason why it did what it did.\n\nYou could, for instance, ask a car fitted with a reasoning engine why it had hit the brakes, and it would be able to tell you that it thought a bicycle hidden by a van was about to enter the intersection ahead. A machine-learning program cannot do that. Besides helping improve program design, such information will, Dr Bhatt reckons, help regulators and insurance companies. It may thus speed up public acceptance of autonomous vehicles.\n\nDr Bhatt\xe2\x80\x99s work is part of a long-standing debate in the field of artificial intelligence. Early AI researchers, working in the 1950s, chalked up some successes using this sort of preprogrammed reasoning. But, beginning in the 1990s, machine learning improved dramatically, thanks to better programming techniques combined with more powerful computers and the availability of more data. Today almost all AI is based on it.\n\nDr Bhatt is not, though, alone in his scepticism. Gary Marcus, who studies psychology and neural science at New York University and is also the boss of an AI and robotics company called Robust. AI , agrees. To support his point of view, Dr Marcus cites a much-publicised result, albeit from eight years ago. This was when engineers at DeepMind (then an independent company, now part of Google) wrote a program that could learn, without being given any hints about the rules, how to play Breakout, a video game which involves hitting a moving virtual ball with a virtual paddle.\n\nDeepMind\xe2\x80\x99s program was a great player. But when another group of researchers tinkered with Breakout\xe2\x80\x99s code\xe2\x80\x94shifting the location of the paddles by just a few pixels\xe2\x80\x94its abilities plummeted. It was not able to generalise what it had learned from a specific situation even to a situation that was only slightly different.\n\nBack to the future\n\nFor Dr Marcus, this example highlights the fragility of machine-learning. But others think it is symbolic reasoning which is brittle, and that machine learning still has a lot of mileage left in it. Among them is Jeff Hawke, vice-president of technology at Wayve, a self-driving-car firm in London. Wayve\xe2\x80\x99s approach is to train the software elements running a car\xe2\x80\x99s various components simultaneously, rather than separately. In demonstrations, Wayve\xe2\x80\x99s cars make good decisions while navigating narrow, heavily trafficked London streets\xe2\x80\x94a task that challenges many humans.\n\nAs Dr Hawke puts it, \xe2\x80\x9cthe complexity of most real-world tasks is greater than is possible to solve with handcrafted rules, and it\xe2\x80\x99s well known that expert systems built with rules tend to struggle with complexity. This is true regardless of how well thought out or structured the formal logic is.\xe2\x80\x9d Such a system might, for instance, craft a rule that a car should stop at a red light. But lights are designed differently in different countries, and some are intended for pedestrians rather than cars. There are also situations in which you might need to jump a red light, such as to make way for a fire engine. \xe2\x80\x9cThe beauty of machine learning\xe2\x80\x9d, Dr Hawke says, \xe2\x80\x9cis that all these factors and concepts can be automatically uncovered and learned from data. And with more data, it continues to learn and become more intelligent.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNicholas Rhinehart, who studies robotics and AI at the University of California, Berkeley, also backs machine learning. He says Dr Bhatt\xe2\x80\x99s approach does indeed show you can combine the two approaches. But he is not sure it is necessary. In his work, and also that of others, machine-learning systems alone can already predict probabilities a few seconds into the future\xe2\x80\x94such as whether another car is likely to give way or not\xe2\x80\x94and make contingency plans based on those predictions.\n\nDr Bhatt responds that you can train a car with data accumulated over millions of kilometres of driving, and still not be sure you have covered all the necessary situations. In many cases, it might be simpler and more effective to program some of the rules in from the start.\n\nFor champions of both strategies, the question goes beyond self-driving cars to the future of AI itself. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think we're taking the right approach right now,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr Marcus says. \xe2\x80\x9c[Machine learning] has proven useful for some things like speech recognition, but it's not actually the answer to AI . We haven\xe2\x80\x99t really solved the intelligence problem.\xe2\x80\x9d One way or another, then, it seems seven-month-olds still have a lot to teach machines. \xe2\x96\xa0\n\nAn early version of this article was published online on September 1st 2021""";"Autonomous Cars";"396.txt-Autonomous Cars"
"397.txt";"b'National Security Implications of Leadership in Autonomous Vehicles\n\nJune 28, 2021\n\nDigital technologies have created a transitional moment for societies. High-speed connectivity, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI) are ubiquitous (even if not always visible) and are reshaping economies by creating new opportunities. This follows a pattern set centuries ago. Automation of basic tasks began in the eighteenth century and accelerated rapidly at the end of the nineteenth century, with a new wave of automation now well underway. Autonomous systems already create value across global markets by lowering costs and improving services. The ability to combine better sensors, more powerful computer processing, and faster connectivity expands the productivity of human labor, creates new services, and automates existing ones.\n\nOne of the most important parts of the next wave of automation is transportation, specifically the appearance of self-driving, or \xe2\x80\x9cautonomous,\xe2\x80\x9d vehicles (AVs). Self-driving cars offer immense gains in productivity and safety. The technologies developed for self-driving cars have broad commercial (and potentially military) implications. A self-driving car is a vehicle capable of navigating without a driver actively operating or monitoring it. Self-driving cars are a kind of specialized robot\xe2\x80\x94not the humanoid robot common to popular culture, but self-operating devices that provide a commercially valuable service and automate routine tasks.\n\nThe impact of autonomous systems on the auto industry will be significant, as the technology behind AVs will reshape transportation and urban life as profoundly as the move from horses to cars. AVs are already a leadingsector for private AI investment, reflecting the market\xe2\x80\x99s estimate of their future importance.\n\nAutomation and the larger digital transformation create major challenges for national security, and the implications of AVs on national security deserve further attention. In addition to new opportunities, widespread deployment of AVs can also create new risks and vulnerabilities, particularly when considered in the context of tech competition between the United States and China.\n\nNational security can be defined as the condition where people can choose how they are governed and live in a world guided by the rule of law. To attain this requires an ability to defend the national interest and, increasingly, an ability to create and use technology in ways that support national security for both the near and long term. Technological leadership used to be seen as important for a few sectors, but its importance has spread across the entire economy. Innovation and the adoption of new technologies are the keys to the long-term growth needed for national security. This is particularly true for automobiles. Cars are now high-tech devices. Vehicles are built around semiconductors and software more than precisely engineered metal parts. The ability to build the cars of the future will be a good indicator of a country\xe2\x80\x99s technological strength and abilities.\n\nThe Military Applications of Autonomous Vehicles\n\nAs much of the innovation and work on AVs is now happening in the private sector, it is reasonable to ask how much carryover there will be from commercial to military uses. In the early stages of developing AV technology, there was considerable overlap. As development progressed, there has been divergence, and the direct application of commercial autonomy will be smaller (the same way a combat aircraft and a passenger aircraft that share certain technologies can jointly benefit from research and development but are ultimately designed for fundamentally different purposes and requirements).\n\nAutonomous devices that operate without human control are deeply attractive to militaries and are already deployed in aerospace and undersea vehicles by leading military powers. Autonomous ground vehicles are more challenging to develop, given the much more complex and varied terrain in which operations take place, but innovation in the commercial self-driving sector could improve military vehicles\xe2\x80\x99 operations. This will be seen first in logistics and support vehicles (e.g., autonomous trucks), where the transition from commercial to military is simpler, and perhaps later in combat vehicles.\n\nIt is not an accident that the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) was the government agency that began work on autonomous driving in 1984 with its Autonomous Land Vehicle program. DARPA then sponsored the earliest AV test in its Grand Challenges, which sought to accelerate the development of AV technologies by holding a race among prototypes for a cash prize. No one completed the first Grand Challenge in 2004. The second iteration, held in a desert area in 2005, was won by a university team which completed the 132-mile course in seven hours. DARPA held a third Grand Challenge two years later in a simulated urban environment, which was also won by another university team. These DARPA efforts, established in response to a 2001 National Defense Authorization Act mandate, jump-started the research into autonomous driving.\n\nBut the current geopolitical contest that threatens U.S. security is not a traditional military competition. It is a new kind of contest that underscores the importance of innovation capabilities and technology leadership. This means that having a strong AV sector, even if not directly applied to military use, is essential for national security. While there may be \xe2\x80\x9cspillover\xe2\x80\x9d effects from technology developed for commercial vehicles for military equipment, the primary contribution will be in strengthening digital industries. That is what will improve national economic performance and help reduce supply chain and espionage concerns. The importance of commercial development has grown. Since the end of the Cold War, advanced technologies have frequently originated in the private sector. The countries that will do best in economics and security will be those that have a strong private-sector tech base from which they can draw upon commercial technological developments.\n\nThe current geopolitical contest that threatens U.S. security is not a traditional military competition. . . . having a strong AV sector, even if not directly applied to military use, is essential for national security.\n\nThe main contribution of AVs to national security, however, does not come from self-driving tanks, but from the importance of the automotive sector to the nation. The automotive industry contributes 3.5 percent of U.S. GDP, making it one of the most important areas of industrial activity (as a comparison, the space and aerospace sector\xe2\x80\x99s share is 4 percent). The development of autonomous and electric vehicles involves the ability to develop and deploy a broad range of important emerging technologies, such as AI, autonomy, and electric propulsion and batteries, and will drive progress in innovation in ways that shape many sectors. Even though the vast majority of the vehicle market is commercial and civilian, when looking at the value of economic strength to national security, AVs are a critical sector for overall national security.\n\nAV Development in the Context of Tech Competition\n\nThe digital transition comes at a moment of significant geopolitical competition. The nature of global competition has changed and is increasingly a battle over technology and economic growth. The national capability to design, build, and innovate in technology will be crucial in this contest.\n\nTechnology creates new kinds of competition and conflict. Leadership in innovation and technology is central to global influence, prestige, and power. AVs are at the cutting edge of technology and are crucial to future U.S. strength. The United States has learned the hard way\xe2\x80\x94in the case of telecom infrastructure manufacturing and Huawei\xe2\x80\x99s extensive deployment and reach\xe2\x80\x94that it is not in the United States\xe2\x80\x99 interest to lose a strategic industry or to find itself dependent on an adversarial foreign power for key technologies. While there is minimal risk that the dynamic automotive sector in the United States would disappear like Nortel or Lucent, keeping this sector strong is essential for the national interest and national security. Automobiles are not an industry the United States can afford to lose any more than it would want to lose its aerospace industry.\n\nDeploying fully autonomous cars is an immense technological challenge, requiring advances in computing, sensors, and networking. The first step has been the deployment of assisted driving systems, which are now relatively common in newer cars. Full autonomy is several levels beyond this and in various stages of testing by several companies. This involves further advances in sensors and processing. The work to meet these challenges will deepen the U.S. technological base and, by commercializing research, strengthen it. Companies will also need a supportive regulatory environment to be able to deploy AVs at commercial scale. For the United States, a strong technology base and supportive regulatory environment is crucial for national security and for maintaining its global influence and economic strength.\n\nThe ability to apply new technologies to commercial and security matters is as important as the ability to create them. Nations that have the companies and skills to develop AI and apply it to economic activities will be stronger and more secure. It is not surprising then that more and more countries are developing their own AI strategies, highlighting their importance for growth and safety. Sixty countries have already collectively issued over 600 AI policy initiatives, including governance efforts and financial support for the sector. These policies will also help make the implementers more influential in the global arena, where global perceptions of tech leadership and economic performance provide substantial political benefit. This has been a core part of the United States\xe2\x80\x99 international strength since landing on the moon in the late 1960s and is one reason why the competition with China creates such serious concerns.\n\nFor the United States, a strong technology base and supportive regulatory environment is crucial for national security and for maintaining its global influence and economic strength.\n\nAdopting new technologies is the best path to creating wealth for countries such as the United States and the best way to increase productivity (which has been a problem for the United States and others, including China). AVs\xe2\x80\x99 most important contribution to national security may come from increasing the United States\xe2\x80\x99 productivity and wealth as part of the larger AI and robotics revolution.\n\nThe United States and China\n\nThere is a clear competition between the United States and China, and a major part of this competition is over leadership in technology. Both sides recognize the economic and security returns of technological leadership, and China has sought technological independence from the West for more than a century. The longer-term contest between the two is over how the world will be structured, and technological leadership is increasingly a determinant of national power.\n\nChina has a very different view of how societies should be governed, how international relations should be structured, and what its place should be among great powers. China is making a concerted and public effort to obtain superiority and to dominate key markets. The MIC2025 plan exemplifies the focus and importance of the technology sector. There are long-standing plans in China (albeit with mixed results) for a massive expansion of its technological capability. There is now a growing realization in the United States that it needs to respond to this, embodied in proposed legislation such as the Endless Frontier Act.\n\nThe desire in China to develop indigenous technological capabilities equivalent to the West dates back to the nineteenth century when European industrialization and its consequences displaced China from what it sees as its rightful place. China\xe2\x80\x99s lack of advanced technologies allowed troubling European interventions in China\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign affairs and began what the Chinese refer to as the \xe2\x80\x9cCentury of Humiliation,\xe2\x80\x9d where the once-great power lost sovereign control to imperialist states in Europe. Almost two centuries later, after surpassing Europe economically, China believes it has reached a moment when it can return to the center of global power. The obstacle to this return is the United States.\n\nThere are many questions about this Chinese narrative of resurgence under the Chinese Communist Party\xe2\x80\x99s (CCP) rule, but it meets compelling domestic political needs. The CCP\xe2\x80\x99s claim to unchallenged rule is buttressed by powerful nationalist sentiments, long present in China as a reaction to the West and now exploited by the CCP. China\xe2\x80\x99s president Xi Jinping has been clear in his views that the West is in decline and that a new world order should be centered on China. China\xe2\x80\x99s rise has been propelled by a number of factors, including heavy state investment in technology, but also by illicit measures, including a disregard for its World Trade Organization (WTO) commitments on the treatment of foreign companies, intellectual property (IP) theft, and a massive industrial espionage campaign targeting Western technology. China feels justified in these actions because of the Century of Humiliation and an artificial narrative about how the United States also relies on similar measures.\n\nChina\xe2\x80\x99s goals are to ensure that its economic development and modernization continues, to end reliance on foreign technologies, and to build a technology base strong enough to produce high-tech weaponry and commercial products that, when combined with subsidies, can displace foreign competitors. China uses a hybrid state/market model. \xe2\x80\x9cMilitary-Civil Fusion\xe2\x80\x9d moves China\xe2\x80\x99s economy much closer to a wartime footing, with a deep integration of the civilian and defense technological systems. Except in a few key areas, China\xe2\x80\x99s innovation system remains weaker than that of the United States. Self-driving cars, however, are an area where there are several competitive Chinese firms and Chinese technology is strong. China\xe2\x80\x99s government seeks to replace the United States in technological leadership and utilize technologies such as AVs to boost its military and economic competitiveness.\n\nThe 2021 annual threat assessment by the U.S. intelligence community addressed the risks to the United States\xe2\x80\x99 national security from emerging technologies. The report concludes that China will maintain its policies to promote indigenous technological innovation, since Chinese leaders perceive these policies as the way to \xe2\x80\x9creduce the dependence on foreign technologies, enable military advances, and sustain economic growth and thus ensure the CCP\xe2\x80\x99s survival.\xe2\x80\x9d AVs and self-driving cars are part of this larger competition between the United States and China. They are also central to the competition over the development and use of AI. In all countries, this AI competition involves a blend of government funding and private actors driven in part or entirely by market incentives and government subsidies.\n\nChina already has a robust AV industry aimed at the commercial market. In early 2017, Qiushi (the official journal of the CCP) identified innovative military technologies, such as unmanned tanks and remote-controlled shop trucks, as a unique opportunity for China to exceed the United States in military power.\n\nBoth China and the United States have advantages and disadvantages in a contest that revolves around technology, research, and investment. The United States benefits from a robust entrepreneurial environment, a dynamic and risk-taking financial system, a strong research base, and an innovation community skilled at commercializing research. China also has an entrepreneurial private sector and a growing research sector, but the government\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to invest large amounts over many years in its technological base is its primary advantage over the United States.\n\nChinese behaviors have eroded the commercial and technological globalization of the last three decades and, more importantly, pose a real national security risk to the United States. A world where China sets the rules will find that the rules are used to meet the needs of the CCP. Privacy is nonexistent in China and will be nonexistent in a world China leads. China will use its political power to confer commercial advantage on its companies at the expense of foreign competitors. This sounds harsh, but it is a description of the CCP, not of China itself.\n\nToday, China has the world\xe2\x80\x99s second-largest economy, supported by state-directed investment, is conducting aggressive industrial espionage programs globally over the internet, and is exhibiting a continued unwillingness to observe trade obligations. Using a Chinese AV, with all its internet connections, could be as risky as using Chinese telecoms.\n\nAutonomous Vehicles Will Create New Cybersecurity Risks and Vulnerabilities\n\nCybercrime is a lucrative activity. It cost the global economy more than a trillion dollars in 2019, and the rate of increase in costs has accelerated since 2010. Cybercrime harms public safety, undermines national security, and damages economies. Ransomware, phishing schemes, and cryptocurrencies make it easier to succeed and monetize cybercrime and, when combined with the sanctuary offered by big countries, help explain the rapid increase. AVs, given their reliance on software, computing, and connectivity, could be a new vector for cybersecurity risks.\n\nCars have become rolling computers, loaded with cameras, microphones, and other sensors, all operated by complex software. Increasingly, modern cars connect to the internet and collect information on location, speed, and perhaps on driver communications (e.g., text, email, voice). This means that data from cars can be accessed remotely, with the owner\xe2\x80\x99s permission or perhaps without it. Manufacturers already use this information for safety, convenience, predictive maintenance, and increasingly for entertainment. Future cars will collect even more data.\n\nSome of that data can reference locations and geographical features. Cross-border data transmission can be problematic if sensitive information is being collected. A 2017 paper from the Chinese Academy of Telecommunication Research of China\xe2\x80\x99s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology addresses that collection of information and considers it a matter of national security if foreign cars are used in China.\n\nAnything that is connected to the internet is vulnerable. The hardware and software behind AVs create a range of opportunities to hackers, as does the need to integrate hardware and software. Many different systems interact in a self-driving car and provide opportunities for hacking to manipulate different systems, including navigation, entertainment, or connectivity with other cars and infrastructure. Given their reliance on continuous communication, another concern is external manipulation of AV systems. From manipulating indicators or attacking the camera system to read speed signs incorrectly, to tampering with road paint to misguide the vehicle, AVs contribute to a vulnerable threat environment.\n\nIn-vehicle and inter-vehicle communication systems are necessary for the safe operation of AVs. In similar ways to the vulnerabilities created by the Internet of Things (IoT), the \xe2\x80\x9cInternet of Vehicles\xe2\x80\x9d (IoV) creates new challenges for cybersecurity. Cars have become another device at the edge of the network where connectivity tempts attackers. Vehicles require not only that their systems be able to communicate with each other, but also connect with other AVs or infrastructure relying on a wireless network.\n\nAnything that is connected to the internet is vulnerable. The hardware and software behind AVs create a range of opportunities to hackers, as does the need to integrate hardware and software.\n\nSupply chains can be compromised from the start. If AVs come from an untrustworthy source or if there are supply chain risks, even the best cybersecurity will not have an impact in risk reduction. A vehicle could be 100 percent unhackable, but if the manufacturer has built-in access and collection or if the information collected by the vehicle is sent over the internet to a hostile country, it will circumvent any defense. There is no need for a back door when the manufacturer has the key to the front door.\n\nRecent events highlight the potential for cybersecurity risks with AVs. Ransomware attacks, where an individual car or a class of cars could be rendered inoperable until a ransom is paid, are possible. While these could be aimed at individual car owners, it is more likely that cybercriminals will go after fleet operations or car manufacturers as better-paying possibilities. While a strong domestic AV industry will not eliminate cybersecurity risk, it would be much more preferable than a supply and car industry located in a hostile competitor.\n\nEspionage and Autonomous Vehicles\n\nThe concerns regarding cybersecurity and data protection are not only important for user protection, but also in the context of national security and geopolitical competition with China. The trove of data collected by AVs, paired with cybersecurity vulnerabilities, creates an appealing target for intelligence collection. AVs will require thinking of cars in a new way when it comes to espionage risk.\n\nIt is unlikely that the governments of other major car producers\xe2\x80\x94Germany, Japan, and Korea\xe2\x80\x94will exploit this advantage. They have no political or security motive to do so. China is another matter, however. A 2020 survey of Chinese espionage by CSIS found 152 publicly reported instances of Chinese espionage directed at the United States since 2000. This did not include espionage against U.S. firms or persons located in China, nor did it include the more than 1,200 IP theft cases brought by U.S. companies against Chinese entities. U.S. officials have repeatedly stated that China\xe2\x80\x99s espionage efforts exceed in scope and scale what was seen in the Cold War. This is because global digital networks and technologies provide China with immense new opportunities for espionage.\n\nIn China, the 2017 National Intelligence Law permits the Chinese government to demand and receive information from Chinese companies and citizens. Article 14 reads that \xe2\x80\x9cstate intelligence work organs, when legally carrying forth intelligence work, may demand that concerned organs, organizations, or citizens provide needed support, assistance, and cooperation.\xe2\x80\x9d Legally carrying forth intelligence work means any action authorized by the CPP leadership, which keeps close control over China\xe2\x80\x99s intelligence agencies and activities.\n\nThis means that data on location, behavior, and potentially conversations from the operators of Chinese-made cars could be accessed by the government over the internet. China is the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest surveillance state, and Chinese network technologies provide the Chinese government with the tools for monitoring behavior and collecting information on residents in its territory\xe2\x80\x94early examples include \xe2\x80\x9cGolden Shield\xe2\x80\x9d (a massive communications surveillance program) and \xe2\x80\x9cGreen Dam\xe2\x80\x9d (a monitoring and censorship program required on laptops in China). China may have tipped its hand about intent when it banned Tesla vehicles from driving into military facilities and housing compounds for personnel working in sensitive industries and state agencies. (Tesla has attempted to placate the Chinese by promising to hold all Chinese data in China.) The features that allow the collection and exfiltration of data potentially make cars an ideal surveillance platform.\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nIf this contest did not involve an unscrupulous and adversarial foreign power, it would be a normal commercial competition among companies, governed by the rules that apply to trade and the protection of IP. Commercial competition shapes U.S., European, Korean, and Japanese auto companies, but the same is not always true for China, where the government can play a much more directive role. That difference is what makes the contest over AVs so important.\n\nThere is a strong research base in Europe, and a long heritage of skilled engineering, but they have had difficulty commercializing the results of research. This may be less of a handicap in self-driving cars, given the strength and central position of the German auto industry, as long as Europe has access to leading-edge AI research and microelectronics from European and non-European sources. The contest takes place in a complicated international political environment. The chief complication is with Europe. Simply put, Berlin is a major driver of European policy, and it is currently unwilling to push hard on China because it is an essential market for Germany\xe2\x80\x99s car industry\xe2\x80\x94even though the Germans fear that China\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate intent is to ransack their automotive technology and displace German carmakers. This could damage a major U.S. security and economic partner in ways that harm both its interests and those of the United States. Trends in European politics suggest this more relaxed approach to China may be changing as suspicions about China\xe2\x80\x99s economic and political power grow.\n\nThe United States has also begun to address the decades-long shortfall in public investment on research and technology. The United States is unused to being challenged and was not prepared for this challenge from China. It has relied on technology to provide a qualitative advantage over opponents since World War II, but the requirements for technological advantage have changed. In the past, technological superiority was produced by a superb scientific establishment, long-term federal support for research, and close links between the research and industrial communities. Both support and linkages atrophied in the last few decades. More importantly, technological innovation is now led by the private sector and oriented toward commercial markets. This is where qualitative advantage for national security will come from in the future.\n\nTechnological progress is cumulative and continuous, and the pace at which nations adopt new technologies will help to determine their security relative to others. The nation that \xe2\x80\x9cdominates\xe2\x80\x9d AI (to quote Russian president Vladimir Putin) will not be \xe2\x80\x9cthe ruler of the world,\xe2\x80\x9d but the nation that is best at creating and accommodating technological change will do better in economics and security than others. The ability to employ AI and autonomous systems to gain better performance, new digital services, and create wealth is at the core of the new international competition and an area where the United States must ensure that its policies and regulations keep it competitive. No nation will \xe2\x80\x9cdominate\xe2\x80\x9d AI or the AV market, but being a leader in autonomy is a vital U.S. interest and crucial for national security.\n\nJames Andrew Lewis is a senior vice president and director of the Strategic Technologies Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, D.C.\n\nThis report is made possible by support from Cruise LLC.\n\nThis report is produced by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a private, tax-exempt institution focusing on international public policy issues.

"40.txt";"b'By Erick Guerra\n\nAlthough technological, financial, and regulatory hurdles remain, fully autonomous vehicles will likely be driving themselves on city streets and highways in the next 20 years \xe2\x80\x94 well within a long-range planning horizon. Major car manufacturers already market and sell high-end vehicles with features like automated braking, self-parking, lane-departure warning, and variable-speed cruise control. Most are racing to develop fully autonomous vehicles \xe2\x80\x94 as are technology firms like Google and Uber \xe2\x80\x94 and nearly half a dozen states have passed laws allowing testing of driverless vehicles on public roads. (Current regulations require a human operator behind the wheel of an autonomous test vehicle, but these regulations are likely to change as the technology advances.)\n\nSelf-driving cars will have a number of social and economic effects. In addition to freeing drivers to engage in tasks other than driving, autonomous vehicles promise to reduce traffic collisions by removing humans, and thus human error and negligence, from behind the wheel. By allowing closer platooning and lowering the number of collisions, self-driving vehicles will also increase effective road capacity, particularly on highways.\n\nSince the initially steep upfront costs of driverless vehicles can be offset by lower labor costs, the freight, transit, and taxi industries could be early adopters of driverless technologies, affecting the country\'s 4.5 million bus, taxi, and truck drivers \xe2\x80\x94 mostly men with high school degrees or less, a demographic that has not fared well in the recent recession or the larger digital revolution.\n\nSelf-driving cars also could have profound, though highly uncertain, impacts on sustainability and urban form, two areas of particular interest to city and regional planners.\n\nTwo scenarios\n\nWhether self-driving cars reduce harmful emissions or the amount of land, energy, money, and other resources consumed by the transportation system depends largely on whether they reduce car ownership and driving. Optimists envision a future where driverless cars lead to a revolution in shared urban mobility. Why own a car when you can summon one to pick you up while avoiding the worries of parking, insurance, or maintenance?\n\nIn this scenario, the shift in ownership will also encourage payment based on miles driven and time of day rather than lumpy vehicle purchases, insurance fees, and parking. Instead of thinking about how much gas is in the tank, travelers will now consider the full marginal cost of a car trip when deciding whether to walk, bike, drive, or take transit. Transit service may also improve as a result of shared cars and minivans operating on fixed and flexible routes.\n\nThe biggest opportunity for improvement is in cities and neighborhoods where densities are currently too low to justify frequent bus or rail service. If shared or public, self-driving cars will dramatically reduce the demand for parking. Even privately owned vehicles will drop off passengers at front doors before driving off-site or behind a building to park, thus decoupling parking from other urban land uses. This would allow cities to dedicate more space to housing, shops, and offices, as well as stormwater management, street trees, and other sustainable features.\n\nPessimists, by contrast, see vehicle automation as one more technology that makes driving more comfortable and convenient and thus increases the amount that people drive. In this scenario, most households will own one or more self-driving cars, send their vehicles to run errands, circle to avoid paying for parking, and treat travel as if it had zero or very low time costs.\n\nMany cars may become full-time mobile offices, whisking people between meetings, and the number of workers commuting between metropolitan regions will almost certainly increase. Making long commutes more productive will support the growing trend in long-duration commutes. Between 1990 and 2010, the proportion of commuters traveling more than 60 minutes and more than 90 minutes to work increased from six to eight percent and 1.6 to 2.5 percent, respectively.\n\nSelf-driving cars will also expand personal mobility for the third of the population without drivers\' licenses and the tenth of households without cars due to age, disability, low income, or preference. A demonstration video of one of Google\'s prototype self-driving cars features a legally blind man riding to a Taco Bell in a self-driving vehicle.\n\nExpanded access to cars may be particularly important for the nation\'s elderly, many of whom live in and would like to remain in car-dependent communities. In this scenario, even if self-driving cars double existing capacity, this capacity will fill quickly \xe2\x80\x94 encouraging dispersed development and greater land consumption, which would further erode any sustainability benefits from increased efficiency.\n\nGlass half full or half empty?\n\nWhose view is more realistic \xe2\x80\x94 the optimists\' or the pessimists\'? Both may be partially correct. Net effects will vary across states, cities, and neighborhoods. In dense urban areas with good transit where the demand for space and shared mobility is higher, driverless cars will tend to increase density and improve transit. In sprawling areas, self-driving cars will encourage more sprawl by making it easier to live farther from employment centers and other destinations. Urban cores will likely concentrate while peripheral areas expand. Suburban areas will probably continue to rely on privately owned vehicles but could see improvements in transit and shared mobility.\n\nWhat can planners do to prepare for driverless vehicles? The new technology could produce rapid and radical changes to metropolitan transportation systems, particularly freight and transit. However, the timing, scale, and direction of the impacts are uncertain and the opportunities to influence outcomes are limited. For better or worse, major changes to passenger travel might be slow to materialize \xe2\x80\x94 the technology remains expensive and the vehicle fleet turns over slowly (the average passenger car is just over 11 years old). Some 15 years after the commercial release of the Toyota Prius, hybrid vehicles make up only a tiny share of the U.S. car fleet.\n\nRegardless, planners should pay close attention to the technology, start thinking about which regulations (particularly on-site parking requirements) could change quickly in response to new technologies, and perhaps redirect capital investments away from infrastructure-heavy projects with a long lifespan to shorter term, more flexible projects that are insulated from some of the uncertainty around the timing and impacts of self-driving cars.\n\nErick Guerra is an assistant professor of city and regional planning at the University of Pennsylvania, where his research focuses on the relationships between transportation infrastructure, land use, urban development, and travel behavior.\n\nWeb-Only Expanded Sidebar\n\nRead ""Attention: The Age of Automation Is Right Ahead,"" an expanded version of the article that appeared in the printed magazine.\n\nResources\n\nImage: This early prototype of Google\'s self-driving car was designed to go from point A to point B without human intervention.

"401.txt";"b'Road vehicle that is capable of moving safely with little or no human input\n\nFor broader coverage of this topic, see Vehicular automation\n\nA self-driving car, also known as an autonomous vehicle (AV or auto), driverless car, or robo-car (robotic car),[1][2][3] is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and moving safely with little or no human input.[4][5]\n\nSelf-driving cars combine a variety of sensors to perceive their surroundings, such as radar, lidar, sonar, GPS, odometry and inertial measurement units.[1][4] Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage.[4][6][7][8]\n\nPossible implementations of the technology include personal self-driving vehicles, shared robotaxis, connected vehicle platoons and long-distance trucking.[4] Several projects to develop a fully self-driving commercial car are in various stages of development. Waymo became the first service provider to offer robotaxi rides to the general public in a part of Phoenix, Arizona in 2020, while Tesla has said it will offer subscription-based ""full self-driving"" to private vehicle owners in 2021,[9][10] and Nuro has been allowed to start autonomous commercial delivery operations in California in 2021.[11] In China two publicly accessible trials of robo-taxis have been launched, in 2020 in Shenzhen\'s Pingshan District by Chinese firm AutoX[12] and in 2021 at Shougang Park in Beijing by Baidu, a venue for the 2022 Winter Olympics.[13]\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nExperiments have been conducted on automated driving systems (ADS) since at least the 1920s;[14] trials began in the 1950s. The first semi-automated car was developed in 1977, by Japan\'s Tsukuba Mechanical Engineering Laboratory, which required specially marked streets that were interpreted by two cameras on the vehicle and an analog computer. The vehicle reached speeds up to 30 kilometres per hour (19 mph) with the support of an elevated rail.[15][16]\n\nA landmark autonomous car appeared in the 1980s, with Carnegie Mellon University\'s Navlab[17] and ALV[18][19] projects funded by the United States\' Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) starting in 1984 and Mercedes-Benz and Bundeswehr University Munich\'s EUREKA Prometheus Project in 1987.[20] By 1985, the ALV had demonstrated self-driving speeds on two-lane roads of 31 kilometres per hour (19 mph), with obstacle avoidance added in 1986, and off-road driving in day and nighttime conditions by 1987.[21] A major milestone was achieved in 1995, with CMU\'s NavLab 5 completing the first autonomous coast-to-coast drive of the United States. Of the 2,849 mi (4,585 km) between Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and San Diego, California, 2,797 mi (4,501 km) were autonomous (98.2%), completed with an average speed of 63.8 mph (102.7 km/h).[22][23][24][25] From the 1960s through the second DARPA Grand Challenge in 2005, automated vehicle research in the United States was primarily funded by DARPA, the US Army, and the US Navy, yielding incremental advances in speeds, driving competence in more complex conditions, controls, and sensor systems.[26] Companies and research organizations have developed prototypes.[20][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34]\n\nThe US allocated US$650 million in 1991 for research on the National Automated Highway System, which demonstrated automated driving through a combination of automation embedded in the highway with automated technology in vehicles, and cooperative networking between the vehicles and with the highway infrastructure. The program concluded with a successful demonstration in 1997 but without clear direction or funding to implement the system on a larger scale.[35] Partly funded by the National Automated Highway System and DARPA, the Carnegie Mellon University Navlab drove 4,584 kilometres (2,848 mi) across America in 1995, 4,501 kilometres (2,797 mi) or 98% of it autonomously.[36] Navlab\'s record achievement stood unmatched for two decades until 2015, when Delphi improved it by piloting an Audi, augmented with Delphi technology, over 5,472 kilometres (3,400 mi) through 15 states while remaining in self-driving mode 99% of the time.[37] In 2015, the US states of Nevada, Florida, California, Virginia, and Michigan, together with Washington, DC, allowed the testing of automated cars on public roads.[38]\n\nFrom 2016 to 2018, the European Commission funded an innovation strategy development for connected and automated driving through the Coordination Actions CARTRE and SCOUT.[39] Moreover, the Strategic Transport Research and Innovation Agenda (STRIA) Roadmap for Connected and Automated Transport was published in 2019.[40]\n\nIn November 2017, Waymo announced that it had begun testing driverless cars without a safety driver in the driver position;[41] however, there was still an employee in the car.[42] An October 2017 report by the Brookings Institute found that the $80 billion had been reported as invested in all facets of self driving technology up to that point, but that it was ""reasonable to presume that total global investment in autonomous vehicle technology is significantly more than this.""[43]\n\nIn October 2018, Waymo announced that its test vehicles had traveled in automated mode for over 10,000,000 miles (16,000,000 km), increasing by about 1,000,000 miles (1,600,000 kilometres) per month.[44] In December 2018, Waymo was the first to commercialize a fully autonomous taxi service in the US, in Phoenix, Arizona.[45] In October 2020, Waymo launched a geo-fenced driverless ride hailing service in Phoenix.[46][47] The cars are being monitored in real-time by a team of remote engineers, and there are cases where the remote engineers need to intervene.[48][47]\n\nIn March 2019, ahead of the autonomous racing series Roborace, Robocar set the Guinness World Record for being the fastest autonomous car in the world. In pushing the limits of self-driving vehicles, Robocar reached 282.42 km/h (175.49 mph) \xe2\x80\x93 an average confirmed by the UK Timing Association at Elvington in Yorkshire, UK.[49]\n\nIn 2020, a National Transportation Safety Board chairman stated that no self-driving cars (SAE level 3+) were available for consumers to purchase in the US in 2020:\n\nThere is not a vehicle currently available to US consumers that is self-driving. Period. Every vehicle sold to US consumers still requires the driver to be actively engaged in the driving task, even when advanced driver assistance systems are activated. If you are selling a car with an advanced driver assistance system, you\xe2\x80\x99re not selling a self-driving car. If you are driving a car with an advanced driver assistance system, you don\xe2\x80\x99t own a self-driving car.[50]\n\nOn 5 March 2021, Honda began leasing in Japan a limited edition of 100 Legend Hybrid EX sedans equipped with the newly approved Level 3 automated driving equipment which had been granted the safety certification by Japanese government to their autonomous ""Traffic Jam Pilot"" driving technology, and legally allow drivers to take their eyes off the road.[51][52][53][54]\n\nDefinitions and classifications [ edit ]\n\nThere is some inconsistency in the terminology used in the self-driving car industry. Various organizations have proposed to define an accurate and consistent vocabulary.\n\nIn 2014, such confusion has been documented in SAE J3016 which states that ""some vernacular usages associate autonomous specifically with full driving automation (Level 5), while other usages apply it to all levels of driving automation, and some state legislation has defined it to correspond approximately to any ADS [automated driving system] at or above Level 3 (or to any vehicle equipped with such an ADS).""\n\nTerminology and safety considerations [ edit ]\n\nModern vehicles provide features such as keeping the car within its lane, speed controls, or emergency braking. Those features alone are just considered as driver assistance technologies because they still require a human driver control while fully automated vehicles drive themselves without human driver input.\n\nAccording to Fortune, some newer vehicles\' technology names\xe2\x80\x94such as AutonoDrive, PilotAssist, Full-Self Driving or DrivePilot\xe2\x80\x94might confuse the driver, who may believe no driver input is expected when in fact the driver needs to remain involved in the driving task.[55] According to the BBC, confusion between those concepts leads to deaths.[56]\n\nFor this reason, some organizations such as the AAA try to provide standardized naming conventions for features such as ALKS which aim to have capacity to manage the driving task, but which are not yet approved to be an automated vehicles in any countries. The Association of British Insurers considers the usage of the word autonomous in marketing for modern cars to be dangerous because car ads make motorists think \'autonomous\' and \'autopilot\' mean a vehicle can drive itself when they still rely on the driver to ensure safety. Technology alone still is not able to drive the car.\n\nSome car makers suggest or claim vehicles are self-driving when they are not able to manage some driving situations. Despite being called Full Self-Driving, Tesla stated that its offering should not be considered as a fully autonomous driving system.[57] This makes drivers risk becoming excessively confident, taking distracted driving behavior, leading to crashes. While in Great-Britain, a fully self-driving car is only a car registered in a specific list.[58] There have also been proposals to adopt the aviation automation safety knowledge into the discussions of safe implementation of autonomous vehicles, due to the experience that has been gained over the decades by the aviation sector on safety topics. [59]\n\nAutonomous vs. automated [ edit ]\n\nAutonomous means self-governing.[60] Many historical projects related to vehicle automation have been automated (made automatic) subject to a heavy reliance on artificial aids in their environment, such as magnetic strips. Autonomous control implies satisfactory performance under significant uncertainties in the environment, and the ability to compensate for system failures without external intervention.[60]\n\nOne approach is to implement communication networks both in the immediate vicinity (for collision avoidance) and farther away (for congestion management). Such outside influences in the decision process reduce an individual vehicle\'s autonomy, while still not requiring human intervention.\n\nWood et al. (2012) wrote, ""This Article generally uses the term \'autonomous,\' instead of the term \'automated.\' "" The term ""autonomous"" was chosen ""because it is the term that is currently in more widespread use (and thus is more familiar to the general public). However, the latter term is arguably more accurate. \'Automated\' connotes control or operation by a machine, while \'autonomous\' connotes acting alone or independently. Most of the vehicle concepts (that we are currently aware of) have a person in the driver\'s seat, utilize a communication connection to the Cloud or other vehicles, and do not independently select either destinations or routes for reaching them. Thus, the term \'automated\' would more accurately describe these vehicle concepts.""[61]\n\nAs of 2017, most commercial projects focused on automated vehicles that did not communicate with other vehicles or with an enveloping management regime. EuroNCAP defines autonomous in ""Autonomous Emergency Braking"" as: ""the system acts independently of the driver to avoid or mitigate the accident."" which implies the autonomous system is not the driver.[62]\n\nIn Europe, the words automated and autonomous might also be used together. For instance, Regulation (EU) 2019/2144 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2019 on type-approval requirements for motor vehicles (...) defines ""automated vehicle"" and ""fully automated vehicle"" based on their autonomous capacity:[63]\n\n""automated vehicle"" means a motor vehicle designed and constructed to move autonomously for certain periods of time without continuous driver supervision but in respect of which driver intervention is still expected or required; [63]\n\n""fully automated vehicle"" means a motor vehicle that has been designed and constructed to move autonomously without any driver supervision;[63]\n\nIn British English, the word automated alone might have several meaning, such in the sentence: ""Thatcham also found that the automated lane keeping systems could only meet two out of the twelve principles required to guarantee safety, going on to say they cannot, therefore, be classed as \xe2\x80\x98automated driving\xe2\x80\x99, instead it claims the tech should be classed as \xe2\x80\x98assisted driving\xe2\x80\x99."":[64] The first occurrence of the ""automated"" word refers to an Unece automated system, while the second occurrence refers to the British legal definition of an automated vehicle. The British law interprets the meaning of ""automated vehicle"" based on the interpretation section related to a vehicle ""driving itself"" and an insured vehicle.[65]\n\nAutonomous versus cooperative [ edit ]\n\nTo enable a car to travel without any driver embedded within the vehicle, some companies use a remote driver.[66]\n\nAccording to SAE J3016,\n\nSome driving automation systems may indeed be autonomous if they perform all of their functions independently and self-sufficiently, but if they depend on communication and/or cooperation with outside entities, they should be considered cooperative rather than autonomous.\n\nClassifications [ edit ]\n\nSelf-driving car [ edit ]\n\nPC Magazine defines a self-driving car as ""a computer-controlled car that drives itself.""[67] The Union of Concerned Scientists states that self-driving cars are ""cars or trucks in which human drivers are never required to take control to safely operate the vehicle. Also known as autonomous or \'driverless\' cars, they combine sensors and software to control, navigate, and drive the vehicle.""[68]\n\nThe British Automated and Electric Vehicles Act 2018 law defines considers a vehicle as ""driving itself"" if the vehicle ""is operating in a mode in which it is not being controlled, and does not need to be monitored, by an individual"".[69]\n\nSAE Classification [ edit ]\n\nA classification system with six levels \xe2\x80\x93 ranging from fully manual to fully automated systems \xe2\x80\x93 was published in 2014 by automotive standardization body SAE International (formerly the Society of Automotive Engineers) as J3016, Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to On-Road Motor Vehicle Automated Driving Systems.[72][73] This classification is based on the amount of driver intervention and attentiveness required, rather than the vehicle\'s capabilities, although these are loosely related. In the United States in 2013, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) released a formal classification system,[74] but abandoned it in favor of the SAE standard in 2016. Also in 2016, SAE updated its classification, called J3016_201609.[75]\n\nLevels of driving automation [ edit ]\n\nIn SAE\'s automation level definitions, ""driving mode"" means ""a type of driving scenario with characteristic dynamic driving task requirements (e.g., expressway merging, high speed cruising, low speed traffic jam, closed-campus operations, etc.)""[1][76]\n\nLevel 0: The automated system issues warnings and may momentarily intervene but has no sustained vehicle control.\n\nLevel 1 (""hands on""): The driver and the automated system share control of the vehicle. Examples are systems where the driver controls steering and the automated system controls engine power to maintain a set speed (Cruise Control) or engine and brake power to maintain and vary speed (Adaptive Cruise Control or ACC); and Parking Assistance, where steering is automated while speed is under manual control. The driver must be ready to retake full control at any time. Lane Keeping Assistance (LKA) Type II is a further example of Level 1 self-driving. Automatic emergency braking which alerts the driver to a crash and permits full braking capacity is also a Level 1 feature, according to Autopilot Review magazine. [77]\n\nmagazine. Level 2 (""hands off""): The automated system takes full control of the vehicle: accelerating, braking, and steering. The driver must monitor the driving and be prepared to intervene immediately at any time if the automated system fails to respond properly. The shorthand ""hands off"" is not meant to be taken literally \xe2\x80\x93 contact between hand and wheel is often mandatory during SAE 2 driving, to confirm that the driver is ready to intervene. The eyes of the driver might be monitored by cameras to confirm that the driver is keeping their attention to traffic. Literal hands off driving is considered level 2.5, although there is no half levels officially. A common example is adaptive cruise control which also utilizes lane keeping assist technology so that the driver simply monitors the vehicle, such as ""Super-Cruise"" in the Cadillac CT6 by General Motors or Ford\'s F-150 BlueCruise. [78]\n\nLevel 3 (""eyes off""): The driver can safely turn their attention away from the driving tasks, e.g. the driver can text or watch a movie. The vehicle will handle situations that call for an immediate response, like emergency braking. The driver must still be prepared to intervene within some limited time, specified by the manufacturer, when called upon by the vehicle to do so. You can think of the automated system as a co-driver that will alert you in an orderly fashion when it is your turn to drive. An example would be a Traffic Jam Chauffeur, [79] another example would be a car satisfying the international Automated Lane Keeping System (ALKS) regulations. [80]\n\nanother example would be a car satisfying the international Automated Lane Keeping System (ALKS) regulations. Level 4 (""mind off""): As level 3, but no driver attention is ever required for safety, e.g. the driver may safely go to sleep or leave the driver\'s seat. However, self-driving is supported only in limited spatial areas (geofenced) or under special circumstances. Outside of these areas or circumstances, the vehicle must be able to safely abort the trip, e.g. slow down and park the car, if the driver does not retake control. An example would be a robotic taxi or a robotic delivery service that covers selected locations in an area, at a specific time and quantities.\n\nLevel 5 (""steering wheel optional""): No human intervention is required at all. An example would be a robotic vehicle that works on all kinds of surfaces, all over the world, all year around, in all weather conditions.\n\nIn the formal SAE definition below, an important transition is from SAE Level 2 to SAE Level 3 in which the human driver is no longer expected to monitor the environment continuously. At SAE 3, the human driver still has responsibility to intervene when asked to do so by the automated system. At SAE 4 the human driver is always relieved of that responsibility and at SAE 5 the automated system will never need to ask for an intervention.\n\nSAE (J3016) Automation Levels[76] SAE Level Name Narrative definition Execution of\n\nsteering and\n\nacceleration/\n\ndeceleration Monitoring of driving environment Fallback performance of dynamic driving task System capability (driving modes) Human driver monitors the driving environment 0 No Automation The full-time performance by the human driver of all aspects of the dynamic driving task, even when ""enhanced by warning or intervention systems"" Human driver Human driver Human driver n/a 1 Driver Assistance The driving mode-specific execution by a driver assistance system of ""either steering or acceleration/deceleration"" using information about the driving environment and with the expectation that the human driver performs all remaining aspects of the dynamic driving task Human driver and system Some driving modes 2 Partial Automation The driving mode-specific execution by one or more driver assistance systems of both steering and acceleration/deceleration System Automated driving system monitors the driving environment 3 Conditional Automation The driving mode-specific performance by an automated driving system of all aspects of the dynamic driving task with the expectation that the human driver will respond appropriately to a request to intervene System System Human driver Some driving modes 4 High Automation even if a human driver does not respond appropriately to a request to intervene the car can pull over safely by guiding system System Many driving modes 5 Full Automation under all roadway and environmental conditions that can be managed by a human driver All driving modes\n\nCriticism of SAE [ edit ]\n\nThe SAE Automation Levels have been criticized for their technological focus. It has been argued that the structure of the levels suggests that automation increases linearly and that more automation is better, which may not always be the case.[81] The SAE Levels also do not account for changes that may be required to infrastructure[82] and road user behavior.[83][84]\n\nTechnology [ edit ]\n\nThe characteristics of autonomous vehicles, as digital technology, are distinguishable from other types of technologies and vehicles. These characteristics mean autonomous vehicles are able to be more transformative and agile to possible changes. The characteristics include hybrid navigation, homogenization and decoupling, vehicle communication systems, reprogrammable and smart, digital traces and modularity.\n\nHybrid navigation [ edit ]\n\nThere are different systems that help the self-driving car control the car, including the car navigation system, the location system, the electronic map, the map matching, the global path planning, the environment perception, the laser perception, the radar perception, the visual perception, the vehicle control, the perception of vehicle speed and direction, and the vehicle control method.[85]\n\nDriverless car designers are challenged with producing control systems capable of analyzing sensory data in order to provide accurate detection of other vehicles and the road ahead.[86] Modern self-driving cars generally use Bayesian simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms,[87] which fuse data from multiple sensors and an off-line map into current location estimates and map updates. Waymo has developed a variant of SLAM with detection and tracking of other moving objects (DATMO), which also handles obstacles such as cars and pedestrians. Simpler systems may use roadside real-time locating system (RTLS) technologies to aid localization. Typical sensors include lidar (Light Detection and Ranging), stereo vision, GPS and IMU.[88][89] Control systems on automated cars may use Sensor Fusion, which is an approach that integrates information from a variety of sensors on the car to produce a more consistent, accurate, and useful view of the environment.[90] Heavy rainfall, hail, or snow could impede the car sensors.[citation needed]\n\nDriverless vehicles require some form of machine vision for the purpose of visual object recognition. Automated cars are being developed with deep neural networks,[88] a type of deep learning architecture with many computational stages, or levels, in which neurons are simulated from the environment that activate the network.[91] The neural network depends on an extensive amount of data extracted from real-life driving scenarios,[88] enabling the neural network to ""learn"" how to execute the best course of action.[91]\n\nIn May 2018, researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology announced that they had built an automated car that can navigate unmapped roads.[92] Researchers at their Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) have developed a new system, called MapLite, which allows self-driving cars to drive on roads that they have never been on before, without using 3D maps. The system combines the GPS position of the vehicle, a ""sparse topological map"" such as OpenStreetMap, (i.e. having 2D features of the roads only), and a series of sensors that observe the road conditions.[93]\n\nHomogenization and decoupling [ edit ]\n\nHomogenization indicates the fact that all digital information assumes the same form. During the ongoing evolution of the digital era, certain industry standards have been developed on how to store digital information and in what type of format. This concept of homogenization also applies to autonomous vehicles. In order for autonomous vehicles to perceive their surroundings, they have to use different techniques each with their own accompanying digital information (e.g. radar, GPS, motion sensors and computer vision). Homogenization requires that the digital information from these different sources is transmitted and stored in the same form. This means their differences are decoupled, and digital information can be transmitted, stored, and computed in a way that the vehicles and their operating system can better understand and act upon it. Homogenization also helps to take advantage of the exponential increase of the computing power of hardware and software (Moore\'s law) which also supports the autonomous vehicles to understand and act upon the digital information in a more cost-effective way, therefore lowering the marginal costs.[citation needed]\n\nVehicle communication systems [ edit ]\n\nIndividual vehicles can benefit from information obtained from other vehicles in the vicinity, especially information relating to traffic congestion and safety hazards. Vehicular communication systems use vehicles and roadside units as the communicating nodes in a peer-to-peer network, providing each other with information. As a cooperative approach, vehicular communication systems can allow all cooperating vehicles to be more effective. According to a 2010 study by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, vehicular communication systems could help avoid up to 79% of all traffic accidents.[94]\n\nThere have so far been no complete implementation of peer-to-peer networking on the scale required for traffic.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2012, computer scientists at the University of Texas in Austin began developing smart intersections designed for automated cars. The intersections will have no traffic lights and no stop signs, instead using computer programs that will communicate directly with each car on the road.[95] In the case of autonomous vehicles, it is essential for them to connect with other \'devices\' in order to function most effectively. Autonomous vehicles are equipped with communication systems which allow them to communicate with other autonomous vehicles and roadside units to provide them, amongst other things, with information about road work or traffic congestion. In addition, scientists believe that the future will have computer programs that connect and manage each individual autonomous vehicle as it navigates through an intersection. This type of connectivity must replace traffic lights and stop signs.[95] These types of characteristics drive and further develop the ability of autonomous vehicles to understand and cooperate with other products and services (such as intersection computer systems) in the autonomous vehicles market. This could lead to a network of autonomous vehicles all using the same network and information available on that network. Eventually, this can lead to more autonomous vehicles using the network because the information has been validated through the usage of other autonomous vehicles. Such movements will strengthen the value of the network and is called network externalities.\n\nAmong connected cars, an unconnected one is the weakest and will be increasingly banned from busy high-speed roads, as predicted by the Helsinki think tank, Nordic Communications Corporation, in January 2016.[96]\n\nIn 2017, Researchers from Arizona State University developed a 1/10 scale intersection and proposed an intersection management technique called Crossroads. It was shown that Crossroads is very resilient to network delay of both V2I communication and Worst-case Execution time of the intersection manager.[97] In 2018, a robust approach was introduced which is resilient to both model mismatch and external disturbances such as wind and bumps.[98]\n\nVehicle networking may be desirable due to difficulty with computer vision being able to recognize brake lights, turn signals, buses, and similar things. However, the usefulness of such systems would be diminished by the fact current cars are not equipped with them; they may also pose privacy concerns.[99]\n\nReprogrammable [ edit ]\n\nAnother characteristic of autonomous vehicles is that the core product will have a greater emphasis on the software and its possibilities, instead of the chassis and its engine. This is because autonomous vehicles have software systems that drive the vehicle, meaning that updates through reprogramming or editing the software can enhance the benefits of the owner (e.g. update in better distinguishing blind person vs. non-blind person so that the vehicle will take extra caution when approaching a blind person). A characteristic of this reprogrammable part of autonomous vehicles is that the updates need not only to come from the supplier, because through machine learning, smart autonomous vehicles can generate certain updates and install them accordingly (e.g. new navigation maps or new intersection computer systems). These reprogrammable characteristics of the digital technology and the possibility of smart machine learning give manufacturers of autonomous vehicles the opportunity to differentiate themselves on software. This also implies that autonomous vehicles are never finished because the product can continuously be improved.[citation needed]\n\nDigital traces [ edit ]\n\nAutonomous vehicles are equipped with different sorts of sensors and radars. As said, this allows them to connect and interoperate with computers from other autonomous vehicles and/or roadside units. This implies that autonomous vehicles leave digital traces when they connect or interoperate. The data that comes from these digital traces can be used to develop new (to be determined) products or updates to enhance autonomous vehicles\' driving ability or safety.[citation needed]\n\nModularity [ edit ]\n\nTraditional vehicles and their accompanying technologies are manufactured as a product that will be complete, and unlike autonomous vehicles, they can only be improved if they are redesigned or reproduced. As said, autonomous vehicles are produced but due to their digital characteristics never finished. This is because autonomous vehicles are more modular since they are made up out of several modules which will be explained hereafter through a Layered Modular Architecture. The Layered Modular Architecture extends the architecture of purely physical vehicles by incorporating four loosely coupled layers of devices, networks, services and contents into Autonomous Vehicles. These loosely coupled layers can interact through certain standardized interfaces.\n\n(1) The first layer of this architecture consists of the device layer. This layer consists of the following two parts: logical capability and physical machinery. The physical machinery refers to the actual vehicle itself (e.g. chassis and carrosserie). When it comes to digital technologies, the physical machinery is accompanied by a logical capability layer in the form of operating systems that helps to guide the vehicles itself and make it autonomous. The logical capability provides control over the vehicle and connects it with the other layers.;\n\n(2) On top of the device layer comes the network layer. This layer also consists of two different parts: physical transport and logical transmission. The physical transport layer refers to the radars, sensors and cables of the autonomous vehicles which enable the transmission of digital information. Next to that, the network layer of autonomous vehicles also has a logical transmission which contains communication protocols and network standard to communicate the digital information with other networks and platforms or between layers. This increases the accessibility of the autonomous vehicles and enables the computational power of a network or platform.;\n\n(3) The service layer contains the applications and their functionalities that serves the autonomous vehicle (and its owners) as they extract, create, store and consume content with regards to their own driving history, traffic congestion, roads or parking abilities for example.; and\n\n(4) The final layer of the model is the contents layer. This layer contains the sounds, images and videos. The autonomous vehicles store, extract and use to act upon and improve their driving and understanding of the environment. The contents layer also provides metadata and directory information about the content\'s origin, ownership, copyright, encoding methods, content tags, geo-time stamps, and so on (Yoo et al., 2010).\n\nThe consequence of layered modular architecture of autonomous vehicles (and other digital technologies) is that it enables the emergence and development of platforms and ecosystems around a product and/or certain modules of that product. Traditionally, automotive vehicles were developed, manufactured and maintained by traditional manufacturers. Nowadays app developers and content creators can help to develop more comprehensive product experience for the consumers which creates a platform around the product of autonomous vehicles.\n\nChallenges [ edit ]\n\nThe potential benefits from increased vehicle automation described may be limited by foreseeable challenges such as disputes over liability,[100][101] the time needed to turn over the existing stock of vehicles from non-automated to automated,[102] and thus a long period of humans and autonomous vehicles sharing the roads, resistance by individuals to forfeiting control of their cars,[103] concerns about safety,[104] and the implementation of a legal framework and consistent global government regulations for self-driving cars.[105]\n\nOther obstacles could include de-skilling and lower levels of driver experience for dealing with potentially dangerous situations and anomalies,[106] ethical problems where an automated vehicle\'s software is forced during an unavoidable crash to choose between multiple harmful courses of action (\'the trolley problem\'),[107][108] concerns about making large numbers of people currently employed as drivers unemployed, the potential for more intrusive mass surveillance of location, association and travel as a result of police and intelligence agency access to large data sets generated by sensors and pattern-recognition AI, and possibly insufficient understanding of verbal sounds, gestures and non-verbal cues by police, other drivers or pedestrians.[109]\n\nAutonomous delivery vehicles stuck in one place by attempting to avoid one another.\n\nPossible technological obstacles for automated cars are:\n\nArtificial Intelligence is still not able to function properly in chaotic inner-city environments. [110]\n\nA car\'s computer could potentially be compromised, as could a communication system between cars. [111] [112] [113] [114] [115]\n\nSusceptibility of the car\'s sensing and navigation systems to different types of weather (such as snow) or deliberate interference, including jamming and spoofing. [109]\n\nAvoidance of large animals requires recognition and tracking, and Volvo found that software suited to caribou, deer, and elk was ineffective with kangaroos. [116]\n\nAutonomous cars may require high-definition maps to operate properly. Where these maps may be out of date, they would need to be able to fall back to reasonable behaviors.\n\nCompetition for the radio spectrum desired for the car\'s communication. [117]\n\nField programmability for the systems will require careful evaluation of product development and the component supply chain. [115]\n\nCurrent road infrastructure may need changes for automated cars to function optimally. [118]\n\nValidation challenge of Automated Driving and need for novel simulation-based approaches comprising digital twins and agent-based traffic simulation.[119]\n\nSocial challenges include:\n\nUncertainty about potential future regulation may delay deployment of automated cars on the road. [120]\n\nEmployment \xe2\x80\x93 Companies working on the technology have an increasing recruitment problem in that the available talent pool has not grown with demand.[121] As such, education and training by third-party organizations such as providers of online courses and self-taught community-driven projects such as DIY Robocars[122] and Formula Pi have quickly grown in popularity, while university level extra-curricular programmes such as Formula Student Driverless[123] have bolstered graduate experience. Industry is steadily increasing freely available information sources, such as code,[124] datasets[125] and glossaries[126] to widen the recruitment pool.\n\nHuman factor [ edit ]\n\nSelf-driving cars are already exploring the difficulties of determining the intentions of pedestrians, bicyclists, and animals, and models of behavior must be programmed into driving algorithms.[8] Human road users also have the challenge of determining the intentions of autonomous vehicles, where there is no driver with which to make eye contact or exchange hand signals. Drive.ai is testing a solution to this problem that involves LED signs mounted on the outside of the vehicle, announcing status such as ""going now, don\'t cross"" vs. ""waiting for you to cross"".[127]\n\nTwo human-factor challenges are important for safety. One is the handoff from automated driving to manual driving, which may become necessary due to unfavorable or unusual road conditions, or if the vehicle has limited capabilities. A sudden handoff could leave a human driver dangerously unprepared in the moment. In the long term, humans who have less practice at driving might have a lower skill level and thus be more dangerous in manual mode. The second challenge is known as risk compensation: as a system is perceived to be safer, instead of benefiting entirely from all of the increased safety, people engage in riskier behavior and enjoy other benefits. Semi-automated cars have been shown to suffer from this problem, for example with users of Tesla Autopilot ignoring the road and using electronic devices or other activities against the advice of the company that the car is not capable of being completely autonomous. In the near future, pedestrians and bicyclists may travel in the street in a riskier fashion if they believe self-driving cars are capable of avoiding them.\n\nIn order for people to buy self-driving cars and vote for the government to allow them on roads, the technology must be trusted as safe.[128][129] Self-driving elevators were invented in 1900, but the high number of people refusing to use them slowed adoption for several decades until operator strikes increased demand and trust was built with advertising and features like the emergency stop button.[130][131] There are three types of trust between human and automation.[132] There is dispositional trust, the trust between the driver and the company\'s product.[132] Situational trust, or the trust from different scenarios.[132] Finally there is learned trust where the trust is built between similar events.[132]\n\nMoral issues [ edit ]\n\nWith the emergence of automated automobiles, various ethical issues arise. While the introduction of automated vehicles to the mass market is said to be inevitable due to a presumed but untestable potential for reduction of crashes by ""up to"" 90%[133] and their potential greater accessibility to disabled, elderly, and young passengers, a range of ethical issues have been posed. Those include, but are not limited to:\n\nThe moral, financial, and criminal responsibility for crashes and breaches of law\n\nThe decisions a car is to make right before a potentially fatal crash\n\nPrivacy issues, including the potential for mass surveillance\n\nPotential for massive job losses and unemployment among drivers\n\nDe-skilling and loss of independence by vehicle users\n\nExposure to hacking and malware\n\nThe further concentration of market and data power in the hands of a few global conglomerates capable of consolidating AI capacity and of lobbying governments to facilitate the shift of liability onto others and their potential destruction of existing occupations and industries.\n\nThere are different opinions on who should be held liable in case of a crash, especially with people being hurt. Many experts see the car manufacturers themselves being responsible for those crashes that occur due to a technical malfunction or misconstruction.[134] Besides the fact that the car manufacturer would be the source of the problem in a situation where a car crashes due to a technical issue, there is another important reason why car manufacturers could be held responsible: it would encourage them to innovate and heavily invest into fixing those issues, not only due to protection of the brand image, but also due to financial and criminal consequences. However, there are also voices[who?] that argue those using or owning the vehicle should be held responsible since they know the risks involved in using such a vehicle. One study suggests requesting the owners of self-driving cars to sign end-user license agreements (EULAs), assigning to them accountability for any accidents.[135] Other studies suggest introducing a tax or insurances that would protect owners and users of automated vehicles of claims made by victims of an accident.[134] Other possible parties that can be held responsible in case of a technical failure include software engineers that programmed the code for the automated operation of the vehicles, and suppliers of components of the AV.[136]\n\nTaking aside the question of legal liability and moral responsibility, the question arises how automated vehicles should be programmed to behave in an emergency situation where either passengers or other traffic participants like pedestrians, bicyclists and other drivers are endangered. A moral dilemma that a software engineer or car manufacturer might face in programming the operating software is described in an ethical thought experiment, the trolley problem: a conductor of a trolley has the choice of staying on the planned track and running over five people, or turn the trolley onto a track where it would kill only one person, assuming there is no traffic on it.[137] When a self-driving car is in following scenario: it\'s driving with passengers and suddenly a person appears in its way. The car has to decide between the two options, either to run the person over or to avoid hitting the person by swerving into a wall, killing the passengers.[138] There are two main considerations that need to be addressed. First, what moral basis would be used by an automated vehicle to make decisions? Second, how could those be translated into software code? Researchers have suggested, in particular, two ethical theories to be applicable to the behavior of automated vehicles in cases of emergency: deontology and utilitarianism.[8][139] Asimov\'s Three Laws of Robotics are a typical example of deontological ethics. The theory suggests that an automated car needs to follow strict written-out rules that it needs to follow in any situation. Utilitarianism suggests the idea that any decision must be made based on the goal to maximize utility. This needs a definition of utility which could be maximizing the number of people surviving in a crash. Critics suggest that automated vehicles should adapt a mix of multiple theories to be able to respond morally right in the instance of a crash.[8][139] Recently, some specific ethical frameworks i.e., utilitarianism, deontology, relativism, absolutism (monism), and pluralism, are investigated empirically with respect to the acceptance of self-driving cars in unavoidable accidents.[140]\n\nMany \'trolley\' discussions skip over the practical problems of how a probabilistic machine learning vehicle AI could be sophisticated enough to understand that a deep problem of moral philosophy is presenting itself from instant to instant while using a dynamic projection into the near future, what sort of moral problem it actually would be if any, what the relevant weightings in human value terms should be given to all the other humans involved who will be probably unreliably identified, and how reliably it can assess the probable outcomes. These practical difficulties, and those around testing and assessment of solutions to them, may present as much of a challenge as the theoretical abstractions.[141]\n\nWhile most trolley conundrums involve hyperbolic and unlikely fact patterns, it is inevitable mundane ethical decisions and risk calculations such as the precise millisecond a car should yield to a yellow light or how closely to drive to a bike lane will need to be programmed into the software of autonomous vehicles.[8][142] Mundane ethical situations may even be more relevant than rare fatal circumstances because of the specificity implicated and their large scope.[142] Mundane situations involving drivers and pedestrians are so prevalent that, in the aggregate, produce large amounts of injuries and deaths.[142] Hence, even incremental permutations of moral algorithms can have a notable effect when considered in their entirety.[142]\n\nPrivacy-related issues arise mainly from the interconnectivity of automated cars, making it just another mobile device that can gather any information about an individual (see data mining). This information gathering ranges from tracking of the routes taken, voice recording, video recording, preferences in media that is consumed in the car, behavioral patterns, to many more streams of information.[99][143][144] The data and communications infrastructure needed to support these vehicles may also be capable of surveillance, especially if coupled to other data sets and advanced analytics.[99]\n\nThe implementation of automated vehicles to the mass market might cost up to 5 million jobs in the US alone, making up almost 3% of the workforce.[145] Those jobs include drivers of taxis, buses, vans, trucks, and e-hailing vehicles. Many industries, such as the auto insurance industry are indirectly affected. This industry alone generates an annual revenue of about US$220 billion, supporting 277,000 jobs.[146] To put this into perspective\xe2\x80\x93this is about the number of mechanical engineering jobs.[147] The potential loss of a majority of those jobs will have a tremendous impact on those individuals involved.[148]\n\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has animated the trolley problem in the context of autonomous cars in a website called The Moral Machine.[149] The Moral Machine generates random scenarios in which autonomous cars malfunction and forces the user to choose between two harmful courses of action.[149] MIT\'s Moral Machine experiment has collected data involving over 40 million decisions from people in 233 countries to ascertain peoples\' moral preferences. The MIT study illuminates that ethical preferences vary among cultures and demographics and likely correlate with modern institutions and geographic traits.[149]\n\nGlobal trends of the MIT study highlight that, overall, people prefer to save the lives of humans over other animals, prioritize the lives of many rather than few, and spare the lives of young rather than old.[149] Men are slightly more likely to spare the lives of women, and religious affiliates are slightly more likely to prioritize human life. The lives of criminals were prioritized more than cats, but the lives of dogs were prioritized more than the lives of criminals.[150] The lives of homeless were spared more than the elderly, but the lives of homeless were spared less often than the obese.[150]\n\nPeople overwhelmingly express a preference for autonomous vehicles to be programmed with utilitarian ideas, that is, in a manner that generates the least harm and minimizes driving casualties.[151] While people want others to purchase utilitarian promoting vehicles, they themselves prefer to ride in vehicles that prioritize the lives of people inside the vehicle at all costs.[151] This presents a paradox in which people prefer that others drive utilitarian vehicles designed to maximize the lives preserved in a fatal situation but want to ride in cars that prioritize the safety of passengers at all costs.[151] People disapprove of regulations that promote utilitarian views and would be less willing to purchase a self-driving car that may opt to promote the greatest good at the expense of its passengers.[151]\n\nBonnefon et al. conclude that the regulation of autonomous vehicle ethical prescriptions may be counterproductive to societal safety.[151] This is because, if the government mandates utilitarian ethics and people prefer to ride in self-protective cars, it could prevent the large scale implementation of self-driving cars.[151] Delaying the adoption of autonomous cars vitiates the safety of society as a whole because this technology is projected to save so many lives.[151] This is a paradigmatic example of the tragedy of the commons, in which rational actors cater to their self-interested preferences at the expense of societal utility.[152]\n\nTesting [ edit ]\n\nTo make a car 95% as safe as an experienced driver, 275 million failure-free autonomous miles (400 M km) are needed while several billions miles (or kilometers) are needed to make them 10% or 20% safer than humans.[153]\n\nThe testing of vehicles with varying degrees of automation can be carried out either physically, in a closed environment[154] or, where permitted, on public roads (typically requiring a license or permit,[155] or adhering to a specific set of operating principles),[156] or in a virtual environment, i.e. using computer simulations.[157][158] When driven on public roads, automated vehicles require a person to monitor their proper operation and ""take over"" when needed. For example, New York state has strict requirements for the test driver, such that the vehicle can be corrected at all times by a licensed operator; highlighted by Cardian Cube Company\'s application and discussions with New York State officials and the NYS DMV.[159]\n\nApple is testing self-driving cars, and has increased its fleet of test vehicles from three in April 2017, to 27 in January 2018, and 45 by March 2018.[160][161]\n\nRussian internet-company Yandex started to develop self-driving cars in early 2017. The first driverless prototype was launched in May 2017. In November 2017, Yandex released a video of its AV winter tests.[162] The car drove successfully along snowy roads of Moscow. In June 2018, Yandex self-driving vehicle completed a 485-mile (780 km) trip on a federal highway from Moscow to Kazan in autonomous mode.[163][164] In August 2018, Yandex launched a Europe\'s first robotaxi service with no human driver behind the wheel in the Russian town of Innopolis.[165] At the beginning of 2020 it was reported that over 5,000 autonomous passenger rides were made in the city.[166] At the end of 2018, Yandex obtained a license to operate autonomous vehicles on public roads in the U.S. state of Nevada. In 2019 and 2020, Yandex cars carried out demo rides for Consumer Electronic Show visitors in Las Vegas. Yandex cars were circulating the streets of the city without any human control.[167][168] In 2019 Yandex started testing its self-driving cars on the public roads of Israel.[169] In October 2019, Yandex became one of the companies selected by Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) to provide autonomous passenger rides to the visitors of Detroit Autoshow 2020.[170] At the end of 2019, Yandex made an announcement its self-driving cars passed 1 million miles in fully autonomous mode in Russia, Israel, and the United States.[171] In February 2020, Yandex doubled its mileage with 2 million miles passed.[172] In 2020, Yandex started to test its self-driving cars in Michigan.[173]\n\nThe progress of automated vehicles can be assessed by computing the average distance driven between ""disengagements"", when the automated system is switched off, typically by the intervention of a human driver. In 2017, Waymo reported 63 disengagements over 352,545 mi (567,366 km) of testing, an average distance of 5,596 mi (9,006 km) between disengagements, the highest among companies reporting such figures. Waymo also traveled a greater total distance than any of the other companies. Their 2017 rate of 0.18 disengagements per 1,000 mi (1,600 km) was an improvement over the 0.2 disengagements per 1,000 mi (1,600 km) in 2016, and 0.8 in 2015. In March 2017, Uber reported an average of just 0.67 mi (1.08 km) per disengagement. In the final three months of 2017, Cruise (now owned by GM) averaged 5,224 mi (8,407 km) per disengagement over a total distance of 62,689 mi (100,888 km).[174] In July 2018, the first electric driverless racing car, ""Robocar"", completed a 1.8-kilometer track, using its navigation system and artificial intelligence.[175]\n\nDistance between disengagement and total distance traveled autonomously Car maker California, 2016[174] California, 2018[176] California, 2019[177] Distance between\n\ndisengagements Total distance traveled Distance between\n\ndisengagements Total distance traveled Distance between\n\ndisengagements Total distance traveled Waymo 5,128 mi (8,253 km) 635,868 mi (1,023,330 km) 11,154 mi (17,951 km) 1,271,587 mi (2,046,421 km) 11,017 mi (17,730 km) 1,450,000 mi (2,330,000 km) BMW 638 mi (1,027 km) 638 mi (1,027 km) Nissan 263 mi (423 km) 6,056 mi (9,746 km) 210 mi (340 km) 5,473 mi (8,808 km) Ford 197 mi (317 km) 590 mi (950 km) General Motors 55 mi (89 km) 8,156 mi (13,126 km) 5,205 mi (8,377 km) 447,621 mi (720,376 km) 12,221 mi (19,668 km) 831,040 mi (1,337,430 km) Delphi Automotive Systems 15 mi (24 km) 2,658 mi (4,278 km) Tesla 3 mi (4.8 km) 550 mi (890 km) Mercedes-Benz 2 mi (3.2 km) 673 mi (1,083 km) 1.5 mi (2.4 km) 1,749 mi (2,815 km) Bosch 7 mi (11 km) 983 mi (1,582 km) Zoox 1,923 mi (3,095 km) 30,764 mi (49,510 km) 1,595 mi (2,567 km) 67,015 mi (107,850 km) Nuro 1,028 mi (1,654 km) 24,680 mi (39,720 km) 2,022 mi (3,254 km) 68,762 mi (110,662 km) Pony.ai 1,022 mi (1,645 km) 16,356 mi (26,322 km) 6,476 mi (10,422 km) 174,845 mi (281,386 km) Baidu (Apolong) 206 mi (332 km) 18,093 mi (29,118 km) 18,050 mi (29,050 km) 108,300 mi (174,300 km) Aurora 100 mi (160 km) 32,858 mi (52,880 km) 280 mi (450 km) 39,729 mi (63,938 km) Apple 1.1 mi (1.8 km) 79,745 mi (128,337 km) 118 mi (190 km) 7,544 mi (12,141 km) Uber 0.4 mi (0.64 km) 26,899 mi (43,290 km) 0 mi (0 km)\n\nApplications [ edit ]\n\nAutonomous trucks and vans [ edit ]\n\nCompanies such as Otto and Starsky Robotics have focused on autonomous trucks. Automation of trucks is important, not only due to the improved safety aspects of these very heavy vehicles, but also due to the ability of fuel savings through platooning. Autonomous vans are being used by online grocers such as Ocado.[citation needed]\n\nResearch has also indicated that goods distribution on the macro (urban distribution) and micro level (last mile delivery) could be made more efficient with the use of autonomous vehicles [178] thanks to the possibility of smaller vehicle sizes.\n\nTransport systems [ edit ]\n\nChina trialed the first automated public bus in Henan province in 2015, on a highway linking Zhengzhou and Kaifeng.[179][180] Baidu and King Long produce automated minibus, a vehicle with 14 seats, but without driving seat. With 100 vehicles produced, 2018 will be the first year with commercial automated service in China.[181][182]\n\nIn Europe, cities in Belgium, France, Italy and the UK are planning to operate transport systems for automated cars,[183][184][185] and Germany, the Netherlands, and Spain have allowed public testing in traffic. In 2015, the UK launched public trials of the LUTZ Pathfinder automated pod in Milton Keynes.[186] Beginning in summer 2015, the French government allowed PSA Peugeot-Citroen to make trials in real conditions in the Paris area. The experiments were planned to be extended to other cities such as Bordeaux and Strasbourg by 2016.[187] The alliance between French companies THALES and Valeo (provider of the first self-parking car system that equips Audi and Mercedes premi) is testing its own system.[188] New Zealand is planning to use automated vehicles for public transport in Tauranga and Christchurch.[189][190][191][192]\n\nImpact [ edit ]\n\nAutomobile industry [ edit ]\n\nThe traditional automobile industry is subject to changes driven by technology and market demands. These changes include breakthrough technological advances and when the market demands and adopts new technology quickly. In the rapid advance of both factors, the end of the era of incremental change was recognized. When the transition is made to new technology, new entrants to the automotive industry present themselves, which can be distinguished as mobility providers such as Uber and Lyft, as well as tech giants such as Google and Nvidia.[193] As new entrants to the industry arise, market uncertainty naturally occurs due to the changing dynamics. For example, the entrance of tech giants, as well as the alliances between them and traditional car manufacturers causes a variation in the innovation and production process of autonomous vehicles. Additionally, the entrance of mobility providers has caused ambiguous user preferences. As a result of the rise of mobility providers, the number of vehicles per capita has flatlined. In addition, the rise of the sharing economy also contributes to market uncertainty and causes forecasters to question whether personal ownership of vehicles is still relevant as new transportation technology and mobility providers are becoming preferred among consumers.\n\nTo help reduce the possibility of safety issues, some companies have begun to open-source parts of their driverless systems. Udacity for instance is developing an open-source software stack,[194] and some companies are having similar approaches.[195][196]\n\nHealth [ edit ]\n\nAccording to a 2020 Annual Review of Public Health review of the literature, self-driving cars ""could increase some health risks (such as air pollution, noise, and sedentarism); however, if properly regulated, AVs will likely reduce morbidity and mortality from motor vehicle crashes and may help reshape cities to promote healthy urban environments.""[197] Driving safety experts predict that once driverless technology has been fully developed, traffic collisions (and resulting deaths and injuries and costs) caused by human error, such as delayed reaction time, tailgating, rubbernecking, and other forms of distracted or aggressive driving should be substantially reduced.[1][198][199][200][201] With the increasing reliance of autonomous vehicles on interconnectivity and the availability of big data which is made usable in the form of real-time maps, driving decisions can be made much faster in order to prevent collisions.[8]\n\nNumbers made available by the US government state that 94% of vehicle accidents are due to human failures.[202] As a result, major implications for the healthcare industry become apparent. Numbers from the National Safety Council on killed and injured people on US roads multiplied by the average costs of a single incident reveal that an estimated US$500 billion loss may be imminent for the US healthcare industry when autonomous vehicles are dominating the roads. It is likely the anticipated decrease in traffic accidents will positively contribute to the widespread acceptance of autonomous vehicles, as well as the possibility to better allocate healthcare resources. If 90% of cars in the US became self-driving, for example, an estimated 25,000 lives would be saved annually. Lives saved by averting automobile crashes in the US has been valued at more than $200 billion annually.[197]\n\nSelf-driving car would have the potential to save 10 million lives worldwide, per decade.[203][197]\n\nAccording to motorist website ""TheDrive.com"" operated by Time magazine, none of the driving safety experts they were able to contact was able to rank driving under an autopilot system at the time (2017) as having achieved a greater level of safety than traditional fully hands-on driving, so the degree to which these benefits asserted by proponents will manifest in practice cannot be assessed.[204] Confounding factors that could reduce the net effect on safety may include unexpected interactions between humans and partly or fully automated vehicles, or between different types of a vehicle system; complications at the boundaries of functionality at each automation level (such as handover when the vehicle reaches the limit of its capacity); the effect of the bugs and flaws that inevitably occur in complex interdependent software systems; sensor or data shortcomings; and successful compromise by malicious interveners. Security problems include what an autonomous car might do if summoned to pick up the owner but another person attempts entry, what happens if someone tries to break into the car, and what happens if someone attacks the occupants, for example by exchanging gunfire.[205]\n\nSome[who?] believe that once automation in vehicles reaches higher levels and becomes reliable, drivers will pay less attention to the road.[206] Research shows that drivers in automated cars react later when they have to intervene in a critical situation, compared to if they were driving manually.[207] Depending on the capabilities of automated vehicles and the frequency with which human intervention is needed, this may counteract any increase in safety, as compared to all-human driving, that may be delivered by other factors.\n\nAn unexpected disadvantage of the widespread acceptance of autonomous vehicles would be a reduction in the supply of organs for donation.[208] In the US, for example, 13% of the organ donation supply comes from car crash victims.[197]\n\nWelfare [ edit ]\n\nAccording to a 2020 study, self-driving cars will increase productivity, and housing affordability, as well as reclaim land used for parking.[209] However, self-driving cars will cause greater energy use, traffic congestion and sprawl.[209] Automated cars could reduce labor costs;[210][211] relieve travelers from driving and navigation chores, thereby replacing behind-the-wheel commuting hours with more time for leisure or work;[198][201] and also would lift constraints on occupant ability to drive, distracted and texting while driving, intoxicated, prone to seizures, or otherwise impaired.[212][213][214]\n\nFor the young, the elderly, people with disabilities, and low-income citizens, automated cars could provide enhanced mobility.[215][216] The removal of the steering wheel\xe2\x80\x94along with the remaining driver interface and the requirement for any occupant to assume a forward-facing position\xe2\x80\x94would give the interior of the cabin greater ergonomic flexibility. Large vehicles, such as motorhomes, would attain appreciably enhanced ease of use.[217]\n\nThe elderly and persons with disabilities (such as persons who are hearing-impaired, vision-impaired, mobility-impaired, or cognitively-impaired) are potential beneficiaries of adoption of autonomous vehicles; however, the extent to which such populations gain greater mobility from the adoption of AV technology depends on the specific designs and regulations adopted.[218][219]\n\nChildren and teens, who are not able to drive a vehicle themselves in case of student transport, would also benefit of the introduction of autonomous cars.[220] Daycares and schools are able to come up with automated pick-up and drop-off systems by car in addition to walking, cycling and busing, causing a decrease of reliance on parents and childcare workers.\n\nThe extent to which human actions are necessary for driving will vanish. Since current vehicles require human actions to some extent, the driving school industry will not be disrupted until the majority of autonomous transportation is switched to the emerged dominant design. It is plausible that in the distant future driving a vehicle will be considered as a luxury, which implies that the structure of the industry is based on new entrants and a new market.[221] Self-driving cars would also exasperate existing mobility inequalities driven by the interests of car companies and technology companies while taking investment away from more equitable and sustainable mobility initiatives such as public transportation.[222]\n\nUrban planning [ edit ]\n\nAccording to a Wonkblog reporter, if fully automated cars become commercially available, they have the potential to be a disruptive innovation with major implications for society. The likelihood of widespread adoption is still unclear, but if they are used on a wide scale, policymakers face a number of unresolved questions about their effects.[118]\n\nOne fundamental question is about their effect on travel behavior. Some people believe that they will increase car ownership and car use because it will become easier to use them and they will ultimately be more useful.[118] This may, in turn, encourage urban sprawl and ultimately total private vehicle use. Others argue that it will be easier to share cars and that this will thus discourage outright ownership and decrease total usage, and make cars more efficient forms of transportation in relation to the present situation.[99][223]\n\nPolicy-makers will have to take a new look at how infrastructure is to be built and how money will be allotted to build for automated vehicles. The need for traffic signals could potentially be reduced with the adoption of smart highways.[224] Due to smart highways and with the assistance of smart technological advances implemented by policy change, the dependence on oil imports may be reduced because of less time being spent on the road by individual cars which could have an effect on policy regarding energy.[225] On the other hand, automated vehicles could increase the overall number of cars on the road which could lead to a greater dependence on oil imports if smart systems are not enough to curtail the impact of more vehicles.[226] However, due to the uncertainty of the future of automated vehicles, policymakers may want to plan effectively by implementing infrastructure improvements that can be beneficial to both human drivers and automated vehicles.[227] Caution needs to be taken in acknowledgment to public transportation and that the use may be greatly reduced if automated vehicles are catered to through policy reform of infrastructure with this resulting in job loss and increased unemployment.[228]\n\nOther disruptive effects will come from the use of automated vehicles to carry goods. Self-driving vans have the potential to make home deliveries significantly cheaper, transforming retail commerce and possibly making hypermarkets and supermarkets redundant. As of 2019 the US Department of Transportation defines automation into six levels, starting at level zero which means the human driver does everything and ending with level five, the automated system performs all the driving tasks. Also under the current law, manufacturers bear all the responsibility to self-certify vehicles for use on public roads. This means that currently as long as the vehicle is compliant within the regulatory framework, there are no specific federal legal barriers in the US to a highly automated vehicle being offered for sale. Iyad Rahwan, an associate professor in the MIT Media Lab said, ""Most people want to live in a world where cars will minimize casualties, but everyone wants their own car to protect them at all costs."" Furthermore, industry standards and best practice are still needed in systems before they can be considered reasonably safe under real-world conditions.[229]\n\nTraffic [ edit ]\n\nAdditional advantages could include higher speed limits;[230] smoother rides;[231] and increased roadway capacity; and minimized traffic congestion, due to decreased need for safety gaps and higher speeds.[232][233] Currently, maximum controlled-access highway throughput or capacity according to the US Highway Capacity Manual is about 2,200 passenger vehicles per hour per lane, with about 5% of the available road space is taken up by cars. One study estimated that automated cars could increase capacity by 273% (\xe2\x89\x888,200 cars per hour per lane). The study also estimated that with 100% connected vehicles using vehicle-to-vehicle communication, capacity could reach 12,000 passenger vehicles per hour (up 545% from 2,200 pc/h per lane) traveling safely at 120 km/h (75 mph) with a following gap of about 6 m (20 ft) of each other. Human drivers at highway speeds keep between 40 to 50 m (130 to 160 ft) away from the vehicle in front. These increases in highway capacity could have a significant impact in traffic congestion, particularly in urban areas, and even effectively end highway congestion in some places.[234] The ability for authorities to manage traffic flow would increase, given the extra data and driving behavior predictability[235] combined with less need for traffic police and even road signage.\n\nInsurance [ edit ]\n\nSafer driving is expected to reduce the costs of vehicle insurance.[210][236][failed verification] The automobile insurance industry might suffer as the technology makes certain aspects of these occupations obsolete.[216] As fewer collisions implicate less money spent on repair costs, the role of the insurance industry is likely to be altered as well. It can be expected that the increased safety of transport due to autonomous vehicles will lead to a decrease in payouts for the insurers, which is positive for the industry, but fewer payouts may imply a demand drop for insurances in general.\n\nIn order to accommodate such changes, the Automated and Electric Vehicles Act 2018 was introduced. While Part 2 deals with Electric Vehicles, Part 1 covers insurance provisions for automated vehicles.\n\nLabor market [ edit ]\n\nA direct impact of widespread adoption of automated vehicles is the loss of driving-related jobs in the road transport industry.[1][210][211][237] There could be resistance from professional drivers and unions who are threatened by job losses.[238] In addition, there could be job losses in public transit services and crash repair shops. A frequently cited paper by Michael Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey found that automated cars would make many jobs redundant.[239] The industry has, however created thousands of jobs in low-income countries for workers who train autonomous systems.[240]\n\nEnergy and environmental impacts [ edit ]\n\nVehicle use\n\nA review found that private autonomous vehicles may increase total travel, whereas autonomous buses may lead to reduced car use.[241]\n\nVehicle automation can improve fuel economy of the car by optimizing the drive cycle, as well as increasing congested traffic speeds by an estimated 8%-13%.[242][243] Reduced traffic congestion and the improvements in traffic flow due to widespread use of automated cars will translate into higher fuel efficiency, ranging from a 23%-39% increase, with the potential to further increase.[242][244] Additionally, self-driving cars will be able to accelerate and brake more efficiently, meaning higher fuel economy from reducing wasted energy typically associated with inefficient changes to speed. However, the improvement in vehicle energy efficiency does not necessarily translate to net reduction in energy consumption and positive environmental outcomes.\n\nAlongside the induced demand, there may also be a reduction in the use of more sustainable modes, such as public or active transport. It is expected that convenience of the automated vehicles encourages the consumers to travel more, and this induced demand may partially or fully offset the fuel efficiency improvement brought by automation.[243] Alongside the induced demand, there may also be a reduction in the use of more sustainable modes, such as public or active transport.[245] Overall, the consequences of vehicle automation on global energy demand and emissions are highly uncertain, and heavily depends on the combined effect of changes in consumer behavior, policy intervention, technological progress and vehicle technology.[243]\n\nProduction\n\nBy reducing the labor and other costs of mobility as a service, automated cars could reduce the number of cars that are individually owned, replaced by taxi/pooling and other car-sharing services.[246][247] This would also dramatically reduce the size of the automotive production industry, with corresponding environmental and economic effects.\n\nIndirect effects\n\nThe lack of stressful driving, more productive time during the trip, and the potential savings in travel time and cost could become an incentive to live far away from cities, where housing is cheaper, and work in the city\'s core, thus increasing travel distances and inducing more urban sprawl, raising energy consumption and enlarging the carbon footprint of urban travel.[243][248][249] There is also the risk that traffic congestion might increase, rather than decrease.[243][216] Appropriate public policies and regulations, such as zoning, pricing, and urban design are required to avoid the negative impacts of increased suburbanization and longer distance travel.[216][249]\n\nSince many autonomous vehicles are going to rely on electricity to operate, the demand for lithium batteries increases. Similarly, radar, sensors, lidar, and high-speed internet connectivity require higher auxiliary power from vehicles, which manifests as greater power draw from batteries.[243] The larger battery requirement causes a necessary increase in the supply of these type of batteries for the chemical industry. On the other hand, with the expected increase of battery-powered (autonomous) vehicles, the petroleum industry is expected to undergo a decline in demand. As this implication depends on the adoption rate of autonomous vehicles, it is unsure to what extent this implication will disrupt this particular industry. This transition phase of oil to electricity allows companies to explore whether there are business opportunities for them in the new energy ecosystem. In 2020, Mohan, Sripad, Vaishnav & Viswanathan at Carnegie Mellon University[250] found that the electricity consumption of all the automation technology, including sensors, computation, internet access as well as the increased drag from sensors causes up to a 15% impact on the range of an automated electric vehicle, therefore, implying that the larger battery requirement might not be as large as previously assumed.\n\nA study conducted by AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety found that drivers did not trust self-parking technology, even though the systems outperformed drivers with a backup camera. The study tested self-parking systems in a variety of vehicles (Lincoln MKC, Mercedes-Benz ML400 4Matic, Cadillac CTS-V Sport, BMW i3 and Jeep Cherokee Limited) and found that self-parking cars hit the curb 81% fewer times, used 47% fewer manoeuvres and parked 10% faster than drivers. Yet, only 25% of those surveyed said they would trust this technology.[251]\n\nParking space [ edit ]\n\nManually driven vehicles are reported to be used only 4\xe2\x80\x935% of the time, and being parked and unused for the remaining 95\xe2\x80\x9396% of the time.[252][253] Autonomous taxis could, on the other hand, be used continuously after they have reached their destination. This could dramatically reduce the need for parking space. For example, in Los Angeles a 2015 study found 14% of the land is used for parking alone, equivalent to some 1,702 hectares (4,210 acres).[254][255] This combined with the potential reduced need for road space due to improved traffic flow, could free up large amounts of land in urban areas, which could then be used for parks, recreational areas, buildings, among other uses; making cities more livable. Besides this, privately owned self-driving cars, also capable of self-parking would provide another advantage: the ability to drop off and pick up passengers even in places where parking is prohibited. This would benefit park and ride facilities.[256]\n\nPrivacy [ edit ]\n\nThe vehicles\' increased awareness could aid the police by reporting on illegal passenger behaviour, while possibly enabling other crimes, such as deliberately crashing into another vehicle or a pedestrian.[257] However, this may also lead to much-expanded mass surveillance if there is wide access granted to third parties to the large data sets generated.\n\nPrivacy could be an issue when having the vehicle\'s location and position integrated into an interface that other people have access to.[1][258] Moreover, they require a sensor-based infrastructure that would constitute an all-encompassing surveillance apparatus.[259] This gives the car manufacturers and other companies the data needed to understand the user\'s lifestyle and personal preferences.[260]\n\nTerrorist scenarios [ edit ]\n\nThere is the risk of terrorist attacks by automotive hacking through the sharing of information through V2V (Vehicle to Vehicle) and V2I (Vehicle to Infrastructure) protocols.[261][262][263] Self-driving cars could potentially be loaded with explosives and used as bombs.[264] According to legislation of US lawmakers, autonomous and self-driving vehicles should be equipped with defences against hacking.[265]\n\nTaxis [ edit ]\n\nWith the aforementioned ambiguous user preference regarding the personal ownership of autonomous vehicles, it is possible that the current mobility provider trend will continue as it rises in popularity. Established providers such as Uber and Lyft are already significantly present within the industry, and it is likely that new entrants will enter when business opportunities arise.[266]\n\nCar repair [ edit ]\n\nAs collisions are less likely to occur, and the risk for human errors is reduced significantly, the repair industry will face an enormous reduction of work that has to be done on the reparation of car frames. Meanwhile, as the generated data of the autonomous vehicle is likely to predict when certain replaceable parts are in need of maintenance, car owners and the repair industry will be able to proactively replace a part that will fail soon. This ""Asset Efficiency Service"" would implicate a productivity gain for the automotive repair industry.\n\nRescue, emergency response, and military [ edit ]\n\nThe technique used in autonomous driving also ensures life savings in other industries. The implementation of autonomous vehicles with rescue, emergency response, and military applications has already led to a decrease in deaths.[citation needed] Military personnel use autonomous vehicles to reach dangerous and remote places on earth to deliver fuel, food and general supplies and even rescue people. In addition, a future implication of adopting autonomous vehicles could lead to a reduction in deployed personnel, which will lead to a decrease in injuries, since the technological development allows autonomous vehicles to become more and more autonomous. Another future implication is the reduction of emergency drivers when autonomous vehicles are deployed as fire trucks or ambulances. An advantage could be the use of real-time traffic information and other generated data to determine and execute routes more efficiently than human drivers. The time savings can be invaluable in these situations.[267]\n\nInterior design and entertainment [ edit ]\n\nWith the driver decreasingly focused on operating a vehicle, the interior design and media-entertainment industry will have to reconsider what passengers of autonomous vehicles are doing when they are on the road. Vehicles need to be redesigned, and possibly even be prepared for multipurpose usage. In practice, it will show that travellers have more time for business and/or leisure. In both cases, this gives increasing opportunities for the media-entertainment industry to demand attention. Moreover, the advertisement business is able to provide location-based ads without risking driver safety.[268]\n\nTelecommunication [ edit ]\n\nAll cars can benefit from information and connections, but autonomous cars ""Will be fully capable of operating without C-V2X.""[269] In addition, the earlier mentioned entertainment industry is also highly dependent on this network to be active in this market segment. This implies higher revenues for the telecommunication industry.\n\nHospitality industry and airlines [ edit ]\n\nDriver interactions with the vehicle will be less common within the near future, and in the more distant future, the responsibility will lie entirely with the vehicle. As indicated above, this will have implications for the entertainment- and interior design industry. For roadside restaurants, the implication will be that the need for customers to stop driving and enter the restaurant will vanish, and the autonomous vehicle will have a double function. Moreover, accompanied by the rise of disruptive platforms such as Airbnb that have shaken up the hotel industry, the fast increase of developments within the autonomous vehicle industry might cause another implication for their customer bases. In the more distant future, the implication for motels might be that a decrease in guests will occur, since autonomous vehicles could be redesigned as fully equipped bedrooms. The improvements regarding the interior of the vehicles might additionally have implications for the airline industry. In the case of relatively short-haul flights, waiting times at customs or the gate imply lost time and hassle for customers. With the improved convenience in future car travel, it is possible that customers might go for this option, causing a loss in customer bases for the airline industry.[270]\n\nIncidents [ edit ]\n\nTesla Autopilot [ edit ]\n\nIn mid\xe2\x80\x91October 2015, Tesla Motors rolled out version 7 of their software in the US that included Tesla Autopilot capability.[271] On 9 January 2016, Tesla rolled out version 7.1 as an over-the-air update, adding a new ""summon"" feature that allows cars to retrieve or self-park at parking locations without the driver in the car.[272] As of November 2020 , Tesla\'s automated driving features is currently classified as a Level 2 driver assistance system according to the Society of Automotive Engineers\' (SAE) five levels of vehicle automation.[55] At this level the car can be automated but requires the full attention of the driver, who must be prepared to take control at a moment\'s notice;[273][274][275][276] Autopilot will sometimes fail to detect lane markings and disengage itself while alerting the driver.[277]\n\nOn 20 January 2016, the first of five known fatal crashes of a Tesla with Autopilot occurred in China\'s Hubei province.[278] According to China\'s 163.com news channel, this marked ""China\'s first accidental death due to Tesla\'s automatic driving (system)"". Initially, Tesla pointed out that the vehicle was so badly damaged from the impact that their recorder was not able to conclusively prove that the car had been on Autopilot at the time; however, 163.com pointed out that other factors, such as the car\'s absolute failure to take any evasive actions prior to the high speed crash, and the driver\'s otherwise good driving record, seemed to indicate a strong likelihood that the car was on Autopilot at the time. A similar fatal crash occurred four months later in Florida.[279][280] In 2018, in a subsequent civil suit between the father of the driver killed and Tesla, Tesla did not deny that the car had been on Autopilot at the time of the accident, and sent evidence to the victim\'s father documenting that fact.[281]\n\nThe second known fatal accident involving a vehicle being driven by itself took place in Williston, Florida on 7 May 2016 while a Tesla Model S electric car was engaged in Autopilot mode. The occupant was killed in a crash with an 18-wheel tractor-trailer. On 28 June 2016 the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened a formal investigation into the accident working with the Florida Highway Patrol. According to NHTSA, preliminary reports indicate the crash occurred when the tractor-trailer made a left turn in front of the Tesla at an intersection on a non-controlled access highway, and the car failed to apply the brakes. The car continued to travel after passing under the truck\'s trailer.[282][283] NHTSA\'s preliminary evaluation was opened to examine the design and performance of any automated driving systems in use at the time of the crash, which involved a population of an estimated 25,000 Model S cars.[284] On 8 July 2016, NHTSA requested Tesla Motors provide the agency detailed information about the design, operation and testing of its Autopilot technology. The agency also requested details of all design changes and updates to Autopilot since its introduction, and Tesla\'s planned updates schedule for the next four months.[285]\n\nAccording to Tesla, ""neither autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor-trailer against a brightly lit sky, so the brake was not applied."" The car attempted to drive full speed under the trailer, ""with the bottom of the trailer impacting the windshield of the Model S"". Tesla also claimed that this was Tesla\'s first known autopilot death in over 130 million miles (210 million kilometers) driven by its customers with Autopilot engaged, however by this statement, Tesla was apparently refusing to acknowledge claims that the January 2016 fatality in Hubei China had also been the result of an autopilot system error. According to Tesla there is a fatality every 94 million miles (151 million kilometers) among all type of vehicles in the US[282][283][286] However, this number also includes fatalities of the crashes, for instance, of motorcycle drivers with pedestrians.[287][288]\n\nIn July 2016, the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) opened a formal investigation into the fatal accident while the Autopilot was engaged. The NTSB is an investigative body that has the power to make only policy recommendations. An agency spokesman said ""It\'s worth taking a look and seeing what we can learn from that event, so that as that automation is more widely introduced we can do it in the safest way possible.""[289] In January 2017, the NTSB released the report that concluded Tesla was not at fault; the investigation revealed that for Tesla cars, the crash rate dropped by 40 percent after Autopilot was installed.[290]\n\nWaymo [ edit ]\n\nWaymo originated as a self-driving car project within Google. In August 2012, Google announced that their vehicles had completed over 300,000 automated-driving miles (500,000 km) accident-free, typically involving about a dozen cars on the road at any given time, and that they were starting to test with single drivers instead of in pairs.[291] In late-May 2014, Google revealed a new prototype that had no steering wheel, gas pedal, or brake pedal, and was fully automated .[292] As of March 2016 , Google had test-driven their fleet in automated mode a total of 1,500,000 mi (2,400,000 km).[293] In December 2016, Google Corporation announced that its technology would be spun off to a new company called Waymo, with both Google and Waymo becoming subsidiaries of a new parent company called Alphabet.[294][295]\n\nAccording to Google\'s accident reports as of early 2016, their test cars had been involved in 14 collisions, of which other drivers were at fault 13 times, although in 2016 the car\'s software caused a crash.[296]\n\nIn June 2015, Brin confirmed that 12 vehicles had suffered collisions as of that date. Eight involved rear-end collisions at a stop sign or traffic light, two in which the vehicle was side-swiped by another driver, one in which another driver rolled through a stop sign, and one where a Google employee was controlling the car manually.[297] In July 2015, three Google employees suffered minor injuries when their vehicle was rear-ended by a car whose driver failed to brake at a traffic light. This was the first time that a collision resulted in injuries.[298] On 14 February 2016 a Google vehicle attempted to avoid sandbags blocking its path. During the maneuver it struck a bus. Google stated, ""In this case, we clearly bear some responsibility, because if our car hadn\'t moved, there wouldn\'t have been a collision.""[299][300] Google characterized the crash as a misunderstanding and a learning experience. No injuries were reported in the crash.[296]\n\nUber [ edit ]\n\nIn March 2017, an Uber test vehicle was involved in a crash in Tempe, Arizona when another car failed to yield, flipping the Uber vehicle. There were no injuries in the accident.[301]\n\nBy 22 December 2017, Uber had completed 2 million miles (3.2 million kilometers) in automated mode.[302]\n\nOn 18 March 2018, Elaine Herzberg became the first pedestrian to be killed by a self-driving car in the United States after being hit by an Uber vehicle, also in Tempe. Herzberg was crossing outside of a crosswalk, approximately 400 feet from an intersection.[303] This marks the first time an individual is known to have been killed by an autonomous vehicle.\n\nThe first death of an essentially uninvolved third party is likely to raise new questions and concerns about the safety of automated cars in general.[304] Some experts say a human driver could have avoided the fatal crash.[305] Arizona Governor Doug Ducey later suspended the company\'s ability to test and operate its automated cars on public roadways citing an ""unquestionable failure"" of the expectation that Uber make public safety its top priority.[306] Uber has pulled out of all self-driving-car testing in California as a result of the accident.[307] On 24 May 2018 the US National Transport Safety Board issued a preliminary report.[308]\n\nOn 16 September 2020, according to the BBC, the backup driver has been charged of negligent homicide, because she did not look to the road for several seconds while her television was streaming The Voice broadcast by Hulu. Uber does not face any criminal charge because in the USA there is no basis for criminal liability for the corporation. The driver is assumed to be responsible of the accident, because she was in the driver seat in capacity to avoid an accident (like in a Level 3). Trial is planned for February 2021.[309]\n\nNavya automated bus driving system [ edit ]\n\nOn 9 November 2017, a Navya automated self-driving bus with passengers was involved in a crash with a truck. The truck was found to be at fault of the crash, reversing into the stationary automated bus. The automated bus did not take evasive actions or apply defensive driving techniques such as flashing its headlights, or sounding the horn. As one passenger commented, ""The shuttle didn\'t have the ability to move back. The shuttle just stayed still.""[310]\n\nPublic opinion surveys [ edit ]\n\nIn a 2011 online survey of 2,006 US and UK consumers by Accenture, 49% said they would be comfortable using a ""driverless car"".[311]\n\nA 2012 survey of 17,400 vehicle owners by J.D. Power and Associates found 37% initially said they would be interested in purchasing a ""fully autonomous car"". However, that figure dropped to 20% if told the technology would cost US$3,000 more.[312]\n\nIn a 2012 survey of about 1,000 German drivers by automotive researcher Puls, 22% of the respondents had a positive attitude towards these cars, 10% were undecided, 44% were skeptical and 24% were hostile.[313]\n\nA 2013 survey of 1,500 consumers across 10 countries by Cisco Systems found 57% ""stated they would be likely to ride in a car controlled entirely by technology that does not require a human driver"", with Brazil, India and China the most willing to trust automated technology.[314]\n\nIn a 2014 US telephone survey by Insurance.com, over three-quarters of licensed drivers said they would at least consider buying a self-driving car, rising to 86% if car insurance were cheaper. 31.7% said they would not continue to drive once an automated car was available instead.[315]\n\nIn a February 2015 survey of top auto journalists, 46% predict that either Tesla or Daimler will be the first to the market with a fully autonomous vehicle, while (at 38%) Daimler is predicted to be the most functional, safe, and in-demand autonomous vehicle.[316]\n\nIn 2015 a questionnaire survey by Delft University of Technology explored the opinion of 5,000 people from 109 countries on automated driving. Results showed that respondents, on average, found manual driving the most enjoyable mode of driving. 22% of the respondents did not want to spend any money for a fully automated driving system. Respondents were found to be most concerned about software hacking/misuse, and were also concerned about legal issues and safety. Finally, respondents from more developed countries (in terms of lower accident statistics, higher education, and higher income) were less comfortable with their vehicle transmitting data.[317] The survey also gave results on potential consumer opinion on interest of purchasing an automated car, stating that 37% of surveyed current owners were either ""definitely"" or ""probably"" interested in purchasing an automated car.[317]\n\nIn 2016, a survey in Germany examined the opinion of 1,603 people, who were representative in terms of age, gender, and education for the German population, towards partially, highly, and fully automated cars. Results showed that men and women differ in their willingness to use them. Men felt less anxiety and more joy towards automated cars, whereas women showed the exact opposite. The gender difference towards anxiety was especially pronounced between young men and women but decreased with participants\' age.[318]\n\nIn 2016, a PwC survey, in the United States, showing the opinion of 1,584 people, highlights that ""66 percent of respondents said they think autonomous cars are probably smarter than the average human driver"". People are still worried about safety and mostly the fact of having the car hacked. Nevertheless, only 13% of the interviewees see no advantages in this new kind of cars.[319]\n\nIn 2017, Pew Research Center surveyed 4,135 US adults from 1\xe2\x80\x9315 May and found that many Americans anticipate significant impacts from various automation technologies in the course of their lifetimes\xe2\x80\x94from the widespread adoption of automated vehicles to the replacement of entire job categories with robot workers.[320]\n\nIn 2019, results from two opinion surveys of 54 and 187 US adults respectively were published. A new standardised questionnaire, the autonomous vehicle acceptance model (AVAM) was developed, including additional description to help respondents better understand the implications of different automation levels. Results showed that users were less accepting of high autonomy levels and displayed significantly lower intention to use highly autonomous vehicles. Additionally, partial autonomy (regardless of level) was perceived as requiring uniformly higher driver engagement (usage of hands, feet and eyes) than full autonomy.[321]\n\nRegulation [ edit ]\n\nThe Geneva Convention on Road Traffic subscribed to by over 101 countries worldwide, requires the driver to be 18 years old.\n\nThe 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, subscribed to by over 70 countries worldwide, establishes principles to govern traffic laws. One of the fundamental principles of the convention has been the concept that a driver is always fully in control and responsible for the behavior of a vehicle in traffic.[322] In 2016, a reform of the convention has open possibilities for automated features. The progress of technology that assists and takes over the functions of the driver is undermining this principle, implying that much of the groundwork must be rewritten.[citation needed]\n\nThis means that in those countries cars might be automated or autonomous or self-driving but not driver-less.\n\nLegislation in Japan [ edit ]\n\nIn 2019, Japan amended two laws, ""Road Traffic Act"" and ""Road Transport Vehicle Act"",[323] and they came into effect in April 2020. In the former act, Level 3 self driving cars became allowed on public roads.[324] In the latter act, process to designate types for safety certification on Level 3 self driving function of Autonomous Driving System (ADS) and the certification process for the asserted type were legally defined.[325] Through the amendment process, the achievements from the national project ""SIP-adus"" led by Cabinet Office since 2014 were fully considered and accepted.[326]\n\nIn 2020, the next stage national level roadmap plan was officially issued which had considered social deployment and acceptability of Level 4.[327][328]\n\nIn 2021, National Police Agency published its committee report of FY 2020 on summary of issues in research to realize Level 4 mobility services, including required legal amendment issues.[329][330]\n\nLegal status in the United States [ edit ]\n\nUS states that allow testing of autonomous vehicles on public roads as of June 2018\n\nIn the United States, a non-signatory country to the Vienna Convention, state vehicle codes generally do not envisage\xe2\x80\x94but do not necessarily prohibit\xe2\x80\x94highly automated vehicles as of 2012 .[331][332] To clarify the legal status of and otherwise regulate such vehicles, several states have enacted or are considering specific laws.[333] By 2016, seven states (Nevada, California, Florida, Michigan, Hawaii, Washington, and Tennessee), along with the District of Columbia, have enacted laws for automated vehicles. Incidents such as the first fatal accident by Tesla\'s Autopilot system have led to discussion about revising laws and standards for automated cars.\n\nFederal policies [ edit ]\n\nIn September 2016, the US National Economic Council and US Department of Transportation (USDOT) released the Federal Automated Vehicles Policy,[334] which are standards that describe how automated vehicles should react if their technology fails, how to protect passenger privacy, and how riders should be protected in the event of an accident. The new federal guidelines are meant to avoid a patchwork of state laws, while avoiding being so overbearing as to stifle innovation.[335] Since then, USDOT has released multiple updates:\n\nAutomated Driving Systems: A Vision for Safety 2.0 (12 September 2017) [336]\n\n(12 September 2017) Preparing for the Future of Transportation: Automated Vehicles 3.0 (4 October 2018) [337]\n\n(4 October 2018) Ensuring American Leadership in Automated Vehicle Technologies: Automated Vehicles 4.0 (8 January 2020)[338]\n\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration released for public comment the Occupant Protection for Automated Driving System on 30 March 2020,[339] followed by the Framework for Automated Driving System Safety on 3 December 2020.[340] Occupant Protection is intended to modernize the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards considering the removal of manual controls with automated driving systems,[341] while the Framework document is intended to provide an objective way to define and assess automated driving system competence to ensure motor vehicle safety while also remaining flexible to accommodate the development of features to improve safety.[342]\n\nState policies [ edit ]\n\nNevada\n\nIn June 2011, the Nevada Legislature passed a law to authorize the use of automated cars. Nevada thus became the first jurisdiction in the world where automated vehicles might be legally operated on public roads. According to the law, the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles is responsible for setting safety and performance standards and the agency is responsible for designating areas where automated cars may be tested.[343][344][345] This legislation was supported by Google in an effort to legally conduct further testing of its Google driverles'";"Autonomous Cars";"401.txt-Autonomous Cars"
"403.txt";"b'The dream of the self-driving car \xe2\x80\x94 you get in, program your destination, ease the seat back, and let the car take you where you need to go. Read a book. Maybe take a nap or play a game on the in-car entertainment screen. Regardless, you will not need to watch the road. The car will get you there and back safely.\n\nAre we there yet? If not, when will we be?\n\nAutomation and autonomous driving are complex subjects. What engineers can safely deliver doesn\xe2\x80\x99t always match what marketers want to sell.\n\nThis guide will walk you through what you need to know about automotive autopilot, self-driving technology, and driver aids today and tomorrow.\n\nWhat is a Self-Driving Car?\n\nWhen discussing automotive assistance systems\xe2\x80\x99 terminology, no one agrees on what to call anything in this field. From engineering jargon to marketing speak, the lingo continues to evolve.\n\nRoughly speaking, you can sort the technologies people might refer to as self-driving into two categories \xe2\x80\x94 driver support and automation systems. Read on to see how they differ.\n\nDriver Support\n\nDriver support technology reduces the workload on the driver. Today, most automakers sell various driver support systems, either as standard equipment or as options on their cars. These include intelligent or adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assists, and hands-free capability.\n\nAutonomous Systems\n\nAutonomous systems do the driving for you. No automaker today sells a true autonomous system, but some are pushing toward that technology. One such project underway is Waymo, a sister company to Google, that is testing autonomous rideshare vehicles in Phoenix using converted Chrysler Pacifica minivans.\n\nRELATED STORIES: Report: Apple Self-Driving Car Coming by 2024\n\nSix Levels of Self-Driving Technology\n\nSAE International, a global association of engineers and related technical experts in the aerospace, automotive, and commercial-vehicle industries, has laid out a useful framework for thinking about self-driving systems. They sort the technologies into six levels, labeled zero through five (okay, even automotive engineers don\xe2\x80\x99t always do the logical thing).\n\nHowever, not every level is classified as autonomous driving. According to SAE, levels zero through two are considered driver support features, while levels three through five are classified as having autonomous capability.\n\nLevel 0\n\nAt Level 0, the car reacts only to the driver\xe2\x80\x99s input. Even if it uses sensors to warn you of surrounding traffic, like a blind-spot alert system or a lane-departure warning, it still has no self-driving capability to correct or counter the perceived threat.\n\nLevel 1\n\nAt Level 1, your car can intervene slightly in your driving in an attempt to keep you safe. A lane-keeping system that helps steer to center you in a lane is a Level 1 technology.\n\nRELATED STORIES: What is Adaptive Cruise Control?\n\nLevel 2\n\nAt Level 2, features communicate with one another, and more than one can be active simultaneously. An example of this autonomous technology is an adaptive cruise control system that adjusts your speed to keep you a certain distance from the car ahead while centering the car in its lane.\n\nCurrently, Level 2 systems are the most sophisticated technology sold on cars in America. Some automakers describe these systems in ways that make them seem more advanced than Level 2 standards because they allow drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel briefly. However, all these systems require drivers to keep their eyes focused ahead. Drivers need to be ready at all times to take over control of the car at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice.\n\nLevel 3\n\nAt Level 3, the car can drive itself under limited conditions, but the driver must remain aware and prepared to take over. Automakers have tested Level 3 systems that will allow the driver to take their hands off the wheel in a traffic jam, for instance, but prompt the driver to take over when the congestion eases.\n\nAccording to Honda and a few other reputable sites, the Honda 100 Legend Flagship car is the first Level 3 autonomous car. Right now, it\xe2\x80\x99s only available in Japan for leasing. It was released on March 5, 2021.\n\nThere are no Level 3 systems currently sold to consumers in the U.S.\n\nLevel 4\n\nAt Level 4, the car can drive itself in a fixed loop on known roads. The rider is not required to take over driving at any time. These vehicles may or may not have a steering wheel or pedals. In some places, Level 4 driverless rideshare vehicles (like Waymo\xe2\x80\x99s) are in limited testing. But they are not yet approved for general use in any state.\n\nLevel 5\n\nAt Level 5, the car can drive itself under any conditions and on any road. These vehicles do not have steering wheels or pedals. At this point, Level 5 systems are theoretical.\n\nCan You Trust It?\n\nAll self-driving systems currently for sale in the United States are SAE Level 2 or lower. It is not safe to remove your attention from driving while behind the wheel of any car currently sold with this technology. However, it is safe to briefly remove your hands from the wheel with some Level 2 systems under certain conditions. But you should remain prepared to take over the driving at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice.\n\nTesla advertises its automation systems more aggressively than any other U.S. automaker. Still, its advertising materials flatly state, \xe2\x80\x9cAutopilot and Full Self-Driving Capability are intended for use with a fully attentive driver, who has their hands on the wheel and is prepared to take over at any moment. While these features are designed to become more capable over time, the currently enabled features do not make the vehicle autonomous.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDo You Still Need to Pay Attention to the Road?\n\nYes. Always. Even when using driving assist technology in Levels 0 to 3, it\xe2\x80\x99s required that you always keep your eyes on the road.\n\nHowever, when using low-speed applications, including self-parking features, keeping your eyes on the road or staying inside the vehicle may not be needed. For example, some luxury brands offer a self-parking remote that handles this maneuver for things like parallel parking.\n\nWhich Cars Have Self-Driving Capability?\n\nVirtually every automaker selling cars in the U.S. today offers driver-assistance systems that can reduce the workload on the driver. These include adaptive cruise control that can adjust speed to maintain distance from the car ahead or automatic emergency braking that can slow or stop the car to avoid hitting a vehicle or pedestrian or reduce the severity of a crash.\n\nNone of these systems are so reliable that the driver can take their attention from the task of driving, though.\n\nMany manufacturers currently market systems up to and including Level 2 automation. This approach combines adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assist into a system that requires that the driver keep their hands on the wheel but relieves some of the driver\xe2\x80\x99s workload.\n\nA prime example is cruise control with stop-and-go capability that allows the driver to negotiate heavy traffic without using the pedals.\n\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s a breakdown of what to expect from several of them.\n\nNissan ProPILOT\n\nNissan markets this as ProPILOT, \xe2\x80\x9ca hands-on driver-assist system that combines Nissan\xe2\x80\x99s Intelligent Cruise Control and Steering Assist technologies and includes a stop and hold function that can bring the vehicle to a full stop, hold in place, and can bring you back up to speed when traffic starts moving again.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNewer versions use the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s navigation system information to slow for curves ahead and prompt the driver to adjust for posted speed limits. While it will keep the car centered in its lane, it will not steer the car through curves like Kia\xe2\x80\x99s, Ford\xe2\x80\x99s, GM\xe2\x80\x99s, or Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s systems.\n\nSubaru EyeSight\n\nSubaru\xe2\x80\x99s EyeSight system does much the same. It also has a pre-collision braking system that alerts the driver to an impending crash and applies full braking power to try to prevent it.\n\nVolvo Pilot Assist\n\nVolvo\xe2\x80\x99s Pilot Assist allows the driver to set a preferred speed and preferred distance from the vehicle ahead. It can then change speed to maintain that distance and keep the car centered in its lane. But Pilot Assist will warn the driver audibly and shut itself off if the road starts to curve or if it detects that the driver has removed their hands from the wheel.\n\nMercedes-Benz Distronic Plus with Steering Assist\n\nMercedes-Benz\xe2\x80\x99s Distronic Plus with Steering Assist also combines adaptive cruise control with a lane-centering system. In keeping with Mercedes\xe2\x80\x99 autobahn image, it functions at up to 120 mph and warns drivers if they are about to be passed.\n\nAnother feature, called Parktronic, allows drivers to follow the car\xe2\x80\x99s commands under 20 mph as it self-parks the vehicle. The driver keeps control of the car with the gas and brake pedals. The driver just needs to put the car in drive or reverse as it drives and steers itself into a parking space.\n\nTesla Autopilot and Full Self-Driving\n\nTesla markets its evolving suite of self-driving technologies more aggressively than any other automaker. This has led to some confusion as to what level of automation Tesla cars are currently capable of. The electric car company sells the systems under two names: Autopilot, and Full Self-Driving.\n\nEvery Tesla vehicle available in 2021 ships with the company\xe2\x80\x99s Autopilot system enabled. Autopilot is a traffic-aware cruise control system that accelerates and slows the car to match the speed of the cars around it, combined with a lane-keeping assist system that centers the car in a clearly marked lane. That\xe2\x80\x99s all it is. The marketing name \xe2\x80\x9cAutopilot\xe2\x80\x9d may make it sound considerably more advanced. But it is similar to adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assist systems offered by most automakers, like Nissan\xe2\x80\x99s ProPILOT or Subaru\xe2\x80\x99s EyeSight.\n\nOlder Teslas use torque sensors in the steering wheel to monitor the driver\xe2\x80\x99s attention level and promptly alert them if their attention seems to be waning. Newer models use a more accurate camera for the same purpose.\n\nFull Self-Driving\n\nTesla\xe2\x80\x99s Full Self-Driving is considerably more sophisticated. Despite its name, it does not possess SAE Level 5 self-driving capability. Full Self-Driving can park the car in a parking space, back it out of a parking space, and change lanes on its own at highway speeds. A more advanced system in beta testing can slow the car for stop signs and traffic lights and navigate highway on-ramps and off-ramps. Tesla regularly sends updates to this system remotely to cars currently involved in the beta test.\n\nCrucially, Full Self-Driving does not allow the driver to take their attention from the road. They may temporarily take their hands from the wheel but should be prepared to take over driving at any moment. Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s own marketing materials caution, \xe2\x80\x9cThe currently enabled Autopilot and Full Self-Driving features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFull Self-Driving is a costly option, even by luxury car standards. As of this writing, the Tesla self-driving price for the feature adds $10,000 to the total cost. Tesla promises to update it regularly in hopes of eventually releasing an SAE Level 5 autonomous driving system to everyone who has purchased Full Self-Driving.\n\nHowever, in a recent letter to California state regulators, Tesla said that Full Self-Driving would remain at Level 2. The company said it did \xe2\x80\x9cnot expect significant enhancements\xe2\x80\x9d that would \xe2\x80\x9cshift the responsibility for the entire dynamic driving task to the system.\xe2\x80\x9d Instead, the letter said, Full Self-Driving \xe2\x80\x9cwill continue to be an SAE Level 2, advanced driver assistance feature.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nConsumers should be aware that the company has told shoppers it will someday have Level 5 capability and has told government regulators that it would not.\n\nCheck out our YouTube videos on the Tesla Model Y and Tesla Model S\n\nGeneral Motors Super Cruise\n\nGeneral Motors offers its own advanced driver assistance system, an SAE Level 2 system called Super Cruise. Like Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s Autopilot, Super Cruise includes an adaptive cruise control that will speed up and slow down the vehicle to maintain a driver-selected distance from the vehicle ahead. It also has a lane-keeping system that tries to center the car in its lane even through curves in the road, and automatic emergency braking that brakes the car in an attempt to avert a collision.\n\nSuper Cruise requires the driver to stay alert and keep their hands near the wheel. It includes a driver monitoring system that watches the driver\xe2\x80\x99s eyes and warns them if their attention seems to be drifting from the road. GM says, \xe2\x80\x9cSuper Cruise allows the driver to drive hands-free when compatible road driving conditions allow the feature to be available. But the driver still needs to pay close attention to the road. Even while using the Super Cruise driver assistance technology, drivers should always pay attention while driving and not use a hand-held device.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSuper Cruise is currently available on most Cadillac vehicles and the Chevy Bolt and Bolt EUV electric vehicles. GM plans to extend it to parts of the Buick and GMC lineup in 2022. Super Cruise is free for the first three years but requires a subscription after that.\n\nOf note, Super Cruise works only on roads mapped by GM. The company mapped at least 200,000 miles of roads in the U.S. and Canada using lidar mapping technology.\n\nFord Blue Cruise\n\nFord and its Lincoln luxury division recently introduced their own Level 2 automation system, called Blue Cruise. Buyers can order Blue Cruise on many new Ford and Lincoln vehicles today. But the system isn\xe2\x80\x99t active yet. Ford expects to activate it late in 2021 through an over-the-air software update that will not require a visit to the dealership.\n\nLike Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s Autopilot and GM\xe2\x80\x99s Super Cruise systems, Blue Cruise pairs an adaptive cruise control with lane-keeping assistance. It allows drivers to temporarily remove their hands from the wheel while keeping their eyes on the road.\n\nBlue Cruise automatically steers the vehicle using more than 100,000 miles of pre-mapped roads stored in the system. In Blue Cruise-equipped cars, the driver\xe2\x80\x99s instrument cluster switches to a blue background when driving on a road where the system can be activated.\n\nA subscription to Blue Cruise costs $600 for three years. However, to use it, you must buy an option package that has all the necessary equipment. The cost range is $995 to $2,600, depending on the model.\n\nTraffic Jam Assists\n\nLuxury automakers have begun developing semi-autonomous driving systems specifically for use in heavy traffic. They allow the driver to relax their attention and let the car accelerate and brake to keep its place in traffic, but systems work only at lower speeds.\n\nBMW\xe2\x80\x99s Active Driving Assistant Pro, for instance, shuts off when traffic exceeds 40 mph. It will not steer the vehicle through curves.\n\nAudi is developing its own Traffic Jam Pilot that, it says, should allow drivers to remove their hands from the wheel below 37 mph. But that system has not received regulatory approval.\n\nThe Future of Self-Driving Cars\n\nEngineers from more than a dozen companies are testing self-driving systems in hopes of producing an SAE Level 5 self-driving car. It seems safe to predict that the technology is coming.\n\nBut the engineering challenge of getting there is immense. A car that can drive itself on well-maintained roads may make a critical mistake on poorly maintained roads. What if a car that can react safely to normal traffic may not react safely to unusual situations? A car that can do everything engineers ask of it may fail when presented with a problem they never considered (in one recent incident, a self-driving car in testing was baffled by a truck bed full of traffic signs being delivered to a construction site. The car had no idea what to do).\n\nBeyond the engineering challenge, 50 sets of state laws (plus the District of Columbia) must adapt to decide safety and liability issues before self-driving cars can become common.\n\nThe market will also have its say. Volkswagen recently unveiled a concept car that would charge by the mile for self-driving capability. Executives reasoned that as long as getting your car to drive you somewhere costs less than a train ticket to that same place, they could charge for using the self-driving feature. So, while some automakers hope to charge buyers upfront for automation, others may make it available for short-term rental only.\n\nLastly, there\xe2\x80\x99s the matter of marketing. It\xe2\x80\x99s already growing difficult to sort what manufacturers claim their cars can do from what they can actually do. That will only grow cloudier as the technology advances.\n\nSo, while you may be able to own a self-driving car in your lifetime, it may be further away than advancing technology would indicate.\n\nMore: Best Cars and Top 10 Lists\n\nRelated Self-Driving Stories:'";"Autonomous Cars";"403.txt-Autonomous Cars"

The updated guidance, 2.0, offers a flexible, nonregulatory approach to automated vehicle technology safety, by supporting the automotive industry and other key stakeholders as they consider and design best practices for the safe testing and deployment of ADS levels 3 through 5. It also provides technical assistance to states and best practices for policymakers regarding ADS.\n\nIn October 2018, U.S. DOT released Preparing for the Future of Transportation: Automated Vehicles 3.0, which builds upon \xe2\x80\x94 but does not replace \xe2\x80\x94 the voluntary guidance provided in 2.0. AV 3.0 expands the scope to all surface on-road transportation systems, and was developed through input from a diverse set of stakeholder engagements throughout the nation. AV 3.0 is structured around three key areas:\n\nAdvancing multi-modal safety, Reducing policy uncertainty, and Outlining a process for working with U.S. DOT.\n\nEnsuring American Leadership in Automated Vehicle Technologies: Automated Vehicles 4.0 was released in January 2020. AV 4.0 builds upon AV 3.0 by expanding the scope to 38 relevant United States Government (USG) components that have direct or tangential equities in safe development and integration of AV technologies. AV 4.0 is structured around three key areas:\n\nUSG AV principles, Administration efforts supporting AV technology growth and leadership, and USG activities and opportunities for collaboration.\n\nAs automated technologies advance, so will the department\xe2\x80\x99s guidance. The guidance is intended to be flexible and to evolve as technology does, but with safety always as the top priority.'";"Autonomous Cars";"404.txt-Autonomous Cars"
"406.txt";"b'Who wouldn\'t want to just press a button, have the steering wheel and pedals stowed, and let your self-driving car whisk you in cocooned comfort to your parent\'s house five hours away while you sleep, work, or play with your kids? That\'s a dream scenario self-driving cars promise. Proponents say there would be no more crashes, no more drunk driving, no more traffic. It\'s tantalizing to think that cars will one day be able to drive us. It can also be terrifying to others who fear letting go of the wheel of control.\n\nSelf-driving cars are already here, in a sense. There are limited trials of vehicles running with no drivers along predetermined, hyper-limited routes in the U.S. and other countries, operated by their makers and technology companies. But the day when millions of self-driving cars ply the world\'s roads is still a long way out. But how far? We take a look at some of the most common questions surrounding self-driving cars and when you might no longer be behind the wheel.\n\nHow Much Does a Self-Driving Car Cost?\n\nAccording to former Waymo CEO John Krafcik, in an interview with German publication Manager Magazin, a Jaguar I-Pace equipped with Waymo\'s sensors and computers costs no more than a moderately equipped Mercedes-Benz S-Class. So likely in the $130,000-$150,000 ballpark. Of course, these costs will come down as the technologies used to power self-driving cars (cameras, radar systems, sensors, advanced automotive computers) drop as the costs to make them become more affordable at scale and they advance enough to be relied upon in all circumstances and conditions. Using Waymo\'s lidar as an example, its engineering team was able to build a version that costs 90 percent less than what used to be $75,000 a unit.\n\nSee all 3 photos See all 3 photos\n\nWhat Are These Automated Driving Levels I Keep Hearing About?\n\nThe Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) has classified six levels of automation. Level 0, Level 1, and Level 2 systems require a human to be actively driving and monitoring the vehicle and the driving environment at all times; think lane-keep assist or active cruise-control systems as seen on current vehicles. But Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 are where automated systems start to take control and when ""self-driving"" enters the picture. Level 3 is in essence a bridge level where the system can drive the car for a period of time, but the driver must still be ready to re-engage with the system at a moment\'s notice. Level 4 and 5 are where the car essentially drives you, with Level 4 still having a few limited scenarios where the driver may need to take over. Level 5 means never having any control of the vehicle whatsoever.\n\nCan I Buy a Self-Driving Car Now?\n\nNo. No vehicles available for sale in the U.S. today are self-driving. Cars equipped with Tesla Autopilot, Ford BlueCruise, and GM SuperCruise are NOT self-driving. They may appear to be self-driving, given that you can drive without your hands on the steering wheel for a predetermined length of time, but they are not reliable or capable enough to be true self-driving. Those systems are classified as Level 2 capable, where the driver can briefly cede driving responsibilities but must be alert and always ready to take over. In effect, the driver is still in charge of the operation of the vehicle, no matter what the system is capable of performing.\n\nSee all 3 photos See all 3 photos\n\nWhen Can I Buy a Self-Driving Car in the Future?\n\nAt this point, self-driving cars are more of a future technology like what you might see in Black Mirror (a near future science fiction TV drama). The tech seems highly plausible, but we are not there yet in reality. We are at a point where we may see Level 3 self-driving cars in the next five years, but they would only work in very limited conditions. Chances are, you may be able to ride in a self-driving taxi without a driver before seeing a self-driving car for sale on a dealer lot. There are still many problems to tackle before Level 4 or 5 autonomous cars can become a real thing. In the meantime, companies will sell some intermediate products to fund their self-driving development. For example, Tesla\'s Full Self-Driving (FSD) system. In theory, a Tesla with FSD has the hardware to ""self-drive,"" but development is not there yet. What Tesla is selling now is a Level 2 driving assist system for real and self-driving as a promise.\n\nWhat Are the Advantages of Self-Driving Cars?\n\nSafety is a major benefit of self-driving cars. The prevailing wisdom is that self-driving systems will drastically reduce or even remove human error on the road, which will reduce crashes to virtually zero. Humans can get tired and distracted, something machines and algorithms will never be. Computers are also able to strictly follow rules and cooperate with one another, so along with a reduced number of crashes, self-driving cars can help smooth out traffic flow and reduce traffic jams. They can also solve the headache of looking for a parking spot by self-parking by themselves. For people who cannot drive (age, disability, or any other reason), automated vehicles can provide them with new personal mobility options.\n\nWhat are Disadvantages of Self-Driving Cars?\n\nIn today\'s stage, the self-drive working condition is very limited. Honda\'s Traffic Jam Pilot can only self-drive under 30 mph (Audi\'s under 37 mph), and Level 4 Waymo vehicles can only operate within a confined zone when weather permits. High cost will also remain a disadvantage until the technology becomes mainstream. Then there\'s the question of how infallible all of the computing power and technology necessary to power self-driving cars will be. Personal computers freeze all the time. What happens when a car\'s computer brain freezes?\n\nCan You Sleep in a Self-Driving Car?\n\nIn a true Level 4 or 5 automated vehicle, yes, you could sleep, but at that point, you\'re basically a passenger, much like riding in a taxi. But in a Level 3 car you\'ll need to remain awake because whenever self-driving conditions are not met, the system needs a human driver to take control. And NO, DO NOT sleep in a Tesla on Autopilot. It is not a self-driving car, even if you bought the Full Self-Driving option.\n\nWhat Technologies Are Essential for Self-Driving Cars?\n\nDriving is a complicated task, so there are many technologies involved. To name a few: ultra-high-resolution cameras with high-dynamic-range sensors to see in various light conditions, ultrasonic sensors to detect objects around the car, light-emitting radar (lidar) to detect faraway objects, ultra-fast computer chips to process the large influx of data pouring in by the millisecond (not to mention storage of said data), and sophisticated software to do the driving. You also need high-speed internet connections to move data to and from the car, to and from other cars, and to and from any infrastructure. One major tech development that will help speed up self-driving car development is machine learning. It contributes to a boost in developing greater image recognition and driving algorithms.\n\nWhat Is Machine Learning for Cars?'";"Autonomous Cars";"406.txt-Autonomous Cars"

"415.txt";"b""When it comes to self-driving cars, the future was supposed to be now.\n\nIn 2020, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be a \xe2\x80\x9cpermanent backseat driver,\xe2\x80\x9d the Guardian predicted in 2015. \xe2\x80\x9c10 million self-driving cars will be on the road by 2020,\xe2\x80\x9d blared a Business Insider headline from 2016. Those declarations were accompanied by announcements from General Motors, Google\xe2\x80\x99s Waymo, Toyota, and Honda that they\xe2\x80\x99d be making self-driving cars by 2020. Elon Musk forecast that Tesla would do it by 2018 \xe2\x80\x94 and then, when that failed, by 2020.\n\nBut the year is here \xe2\x80\x94 and the self-driving cars aren\xe2\x80\x99t.\n\nDespite extraordinary efforts from many of the leading names in tech and in automaking, fully autonomous cars are still out of reach except in special trial programs. You can buy a car that will automatically brake for you when it anticipates a collision, or one that helps keep you in your lane, or even a Tesla Model S (which \xe2\x80\x94 disclosure \xe2\x80\x94 my partner and I own) whose Autopilot mostly handles highway driving.\n\nBut almost every one of the above predictions has been rolled back as the engineering teams at those companies struggle to make self-driving cars work properly.\n\nWhat happened? Here are nine questions you might have had about this long-promised technology, and why the future we were promised still hasn\xe2\x80\x99t arrived.\n\n1) How exactly do self-driving cars work?\n\nEngineers have been attempting prototypes of self-driving cars for decades. The idea behind it is really simple: Outfit a car with cameras that can track all the objects around it and have the car react if it\xe2\x80\x99s about to steer into one. Teach in-car computers the rules of the road and set them loose to navigate to their own destination.\n\nThis simple description elides a whole lot of complexity. Driving is one of the more complicated activities humans routinely do. Following a list of rules of the road isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough to drive as well as a human does, because we do things like make eye contact with others to confirm who has the right of way, react to weather conditions, and otherwise make judgment calls that are difficult to encode in hard-and-fast rules.\n\nAnd even the simple parts of driving \xe2\x80\x94 like tracking the objects around a car on the road \xe2\x80\x94 are actually much trickier than they sound. Take Google\xe2\x80\x99s sister company Waymo, the industry leader in self-driving cars. Waymo\xe2\x80\x99s cars, which are fairly typical of other self-driving cars, use high-resolution cameras and lidar (light detection and ranging), a way of estimating distances to objects by bouncing light and sound off things.\n\nThe car\xe2\x80\x99s computers combine all of this to build a picture of where other cars, cyclists, pedestrians, and obstacles are and where they\xe2\x80\x99re moving. For this part, lots of training data is needed \xe2\x80\x94 that is, the car has to draw on millions of miles of driving data that Waymo has collected to form expectations about how other objects might move. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to get enough training data on the road, so the cars also train based on simulation data \xe2\x80\x94 but engineers have to be sure that their AI systems will generalize correctly from the simulation data to the real world.\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s far from a complete description of the systems at work when a self-driving car is on the road. But it illustrates an important principle to keep in mind when wondering where our self-driving cars are: Even the \xe2\x80\x9ceasy\xe2\x80\x9d things turn out to hide surprising complexity.\n\n2) Why is it taking longer than expected to get self-driving cars on the road?\n\nSelf-driving cars rely on artificial intelligence to work. And the 2010s were a great decade for AI. We saw big advances in translation, speech generation, computer vision and object recognition, and game-playing. AI used to have a hard time identifying dogs in pictures; now that\xe2\x80\x99s a trivial task.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s this progress in AI that drove the optimistic predictions for self-driving cars in the mid-2010s. Researchers anticipated that we could build on the amazing gains they\xe2\x80\x99d seen (and are still seeing) in other arenas.\n\nBut when it came to self-driving cars, the limitations of those gains became very apparent. Even with extraordinary amounts of time, money, and effort invested, no team could figure out how to have AI solve a real-world problem: navigating our roads with the high degree of reliability needed.\n\nMuch of the problem is the need for lots of training data. The ideal way to train a self-driving car would be to show it billions of hours of footage of real driving, and use that to teach the computer good driving behavior. Modern machine learning systems do really well when they have abundant data, and very poorly when they have only a little bit of it. But collecting data for self-driving cars is expensive. And since some events are rare \xe2\x80\x94 witnessing a car accident ahead, say, or encountering debris on the road \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s possible for the car to be out of its depth because it has encountered a situation so infrequently in its training data.\n\nCarmakers have tried to get around this in lots of ways. They\xe2\x80\x99ve driven more miles. They\xe2\x80\x99ve trained the cars in simulations. They sometimes engineer specific situations so that they can get more training data about those situations for the cars.\n\nAnd they are getting closer. Waymo cars do roam the streets of Arizona with no one behind the wheel (a small pool of specially screened people can call them up like they would an Uber). If all goes well, they may expand to more cities later this year (more on this below). But it\xe2\x80\x99s a hard problem, and progress has been slow.\n\n3) What does a world with self-driving cars look like?\n\nCompanies continue to invest despite the setbacks because self-driving cars, when they happen, will change a lot for the world \xe2\x80\x94 and make their creators lots of money.\n\nMany consumers will want to upgrade. Imagine being able to read or doze off during your morning drive to work or on long car trips. It also seems likely that taxi and ride-hailing companies will offer self-driving cars, rather than paying drivers (in fact, companies like Uber are betting on it). Self-driving cars should also make a huge difference for Americans with disabilities, many of whom can\xe2\x80\x99t get a driver\xe2\x80\x99s license and have trouble getting to work, the store, and doctor\xe2\x80\x99s appointments.\n\nExperts disagree on whether self-driving cars will change anything fundamental about car ownership in America. Some argue that people won\xe2\x80\x99t need to own a car if they can order one on their phone and get a timely robot ride anywhere.\n\nOthers have pointed out that people generally still own a car even in areas with good ride-share coverage and that self-driving cars might not be any different. Polls suggest that most Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be driven to work by a self-driving car \xe2\x80\x94 but that might change fast once such cars actually exist. Gallup polling on this question found a small share (9 percent) of Americans who\xe2\x80\x99d get such a car right away, with a larger contingent (38 percent) saying they\xe2\x80\x99d wait a while, and half holding steadfast that they\xe2\x80\x99d never use one.\n\nOver time, our infrastructure will likely change to make it easier for self-driving cars to navigate, and in fact, some researchers have argued that we won\xe2\x80\x99t have widespread self-driving cars until we\xe2\x80\x99ve made major changes to our streets to make it easier to communicate information to those cars. That would be expensive and require nationwide coordination, so it seems likely that it would follow the widespread introduction of self-driving cars rather than precede it.\n\n4) What are the leading self-driving car programs, and what are they doing?\n\nAlmost every major car manufacturer has at least tested the waters with self-driving car research. But some are much more serious about it than others.\n\nThere are two core statistics useful for evaluating how advanced a self-driving car program is. One is how many miles it has driven. That\xe2\x80\x99s a proxy for how much training data the company has, and how much investment it has poured into getting its cars on the road.\n\nThe other is disengagements \xe2\x80\x94 moments when a human driver has to take over because the computer couldn\xe2\x80\x99t handle a situation \xe2\x80\x94 per mile driven. Most companies don\xe2\x80\x99t share these statistics, but the state of California requires that they be reported, and so California\xe2\x80\x99s statistics are the best peek into how various companies are doing.\n\nOn both fronts, Google\xe2\x80\x99s sister company Waymo is the clear leader. Waymo just announced 20 million miles driven overall, most of those not in California. In 2018, Waymo drove 1.2 million miles in California, with 0.09 disengagements every 1,000 miles. Coming in second is General Motors\xe2\x80\x99 Cruise, with about half a million miles and 0.19 disengagements per 1,000 miles. (Cruise argues that since it tests its cars on San Francisco\xe2\x80\x99s difficult streets, these numbers are even more impressive than they look.)\n\nThose two companies are well ahead of everyone else in both miles driven and disengagements in the state of California. While that\xe2\x80\x99s only a limited snapshot of their efforts, most experts consider them the leading programs in general.\n\n5) Didn\xe2\x80\x99t a self-driving car kill a woman? How did that happen? And what are the safety issues involved with self-driving cars?\n\nMarch 18, 2018, was the first time a self-driving car ran down a pedestrian. An Uber car with a safety driver behind the wheel hit and killed Elaine Herzberg, a 49-year-old woman walking her bicycle across the street in Tempe, Arizona.\n\nThe incident was a reminder that self-driving car technology still had a long way to go. Some people were quick to point out that humans frequently kill other humans while driving, and that even if self-driving cars are much safer than humans, there will be some fatal incidents with self-driving cars. That\xe2\x80\x99s true as far as it goes. But it misses a key point. Human driving produces one fatal accident in every 100 million miles driven. Waymo, the leader in miles driven, just reached 20 million miles driven. It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had a fatal accident yet, but given the number of miles its cars have driven, it\xe2\x80\x99s simply far too soon to prove that they\xe2\x80\x99re as safe as or safer than a human driver.\n\nUber hasn\xe2\x80\x99t driven nearly as many miles and has had a fatal incident. The company doesn\xe2\x80\x99t release specific figures, but its filings for its IPO last year said that it had driven \xe2\x80\x9cmillions\xe2\x80\x9d of miles. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to tell without specific numbers, but it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to wonder if Uber\xe2\x80\x99s driving record is much worse than a human\xe2\x80\x99s.\n\nFurthermore, a review of Herzberg\xe2\x80\x99s death suggests that a lot of preventable mistakes were made. The accident report by the National Transportation Safety Board, released in December 2019, found that the near-range cameras and the ultrasonic sensors \xe2\x80\x9cwere not in use at the time of the crash.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAdditionally, the system was having such a problem with false alarms \xe2\x80\x94 detecting dangerous situations when none existed \xe2\x80\x94 that it had been programmed with \xe2\x80\x9ca one-second period during which the ADS [automated driving system] suppresses planned braking while the (1) system verifies the nature of the detected hazard and calculates an alternative path, or (2) vehicle operator takes control of the vehicle,\xe2\x80\x9d according to the NTSB report. So even when the car detected the hazard, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t brake \xe2\x80\x94 which could have made the collision avoidable or much less deadly \xe2\x80\x94 but instead continued with exactly what it was doing for a full second.\n\nThe system was designed to assume that pedestrians would never cross except at a crosswalk, so when one did cross without using one, it failed to identify her. Even worse, when the system was unclear on whether an object was a bicycle (as it was with Herzberg), it was unable to retain any information about how the object was moving. The system sensed her presence six full seconds before the impact \xe2\x80\x94 and yet did nothing (except possibly braking in the last two-tenths of a second) before colliding with her at deadly speed.\n\nThose are avoidable failures.\n\nUber pulled its cars off the road in response, returning to self-driving car trials a year later with a drastically changed program. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve implemented key safety improvements from both safety reviews, shared our learnings with the larger self-driving industry, and accepted the NTSB\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation to implement a Safety Management System, which is underway today,\xe2\x80\x9d Nat Beuse, Uber\xe2\x80\x99s self-driving cars head of safety, told Vox in a statement in response to a request for comment. \xe2\x80\x9cAs we look ahead to the future, we\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to keep safety at the center of every decision we make.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNonetheless, deadly accidents with self-driving cars will keep happening \xe2\x80\x94 and it\xe2\x80\x99s not just Uber. A report from the National Transportation Safety Board implicated Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s Autopilot system in another lethal 2018 accident; while the driver had his hands off the wheel, the car steered into a concrete divider and crashed, killing him. A full investigation hasn\xe2\x80\x99t yet been conducted on three more recent deadly Tesla crashes. The problem, according to NTSB chairman Robert Sumwalt, is that drivers assume Autopilot lets them take their attention off the road, when they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. That won\xe2\x80\x99t be a problem with fully autonomous vehicles, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a potentially major one now.\n\nAs I\xe2\x80\x99ve written before, getting good self-driving cars on the road can save hundreds of thousands of lives. But it takes a lot of engineering work to get the cars good enough to be lifesaving.\n\n6) Are self-driving cars going to be good for the environment?\n\nSome advocates have argued that self-driving cars will be good for the environment. They claim they might reduce car trips by making car ownership unnecessary and transitioning society to a model where most people don\xe2\x80\x99t own a car and just call for one when they need one.\n\nIn addition, others have argued that human drivers drive in a wasteful way \xe2\x80\x94 braking hard, accelerating hard, idling the engine, all of which use up fuel \xe2\x80\x94 which a computer could avoid.\n\nBut as self-driving cars have inched closer to reality, most of these claimed benefits have started to look less likely.\n\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s not much evidence that computers are dramatically more fuel-efficient drivers than humans. There\xe2\x80\x99s one small study suggesting adaptive cruise control improves efficiency a little (5 to 7 percent), but there\xe2\x80\x99s little else beyond that. Furthermore, researchers have examined the effects of more fuel-efficient cars on miles traveled and found that, under many circumstances, people drive more when cars get more fuel-efficient \xe2\x80\x94 so self-driving cars having higher fuel efficiency might not mean that they produce lower emissions.\n\nOne study attempting to estimate the effects of self-driving cars on car use behavior simulated a family having a self-driving car by paying for them to have a chauffeur for a week, and telling them to treat the chauffeur service the way they\xe2\x80\x99d treat having a car that could drive itself.\n\nThe result? They went on a lot more car trips.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s still possible that some big transition to a lower-driving world will happen. A study of one week of driving habits isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough to settle the question for sure. The researchers who conducted that study are preparing future studies, and it\xe2\x80\x99s possible those comparisons will turn up more encouraging results.\n\n7) So if they\xe2\x80\x99re not necessarily safer and they\xe2\x80\x99re not necessarily greener, why are we even doing this?\n\nThe above few sections might inspire some pessimism, but there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of reason to be excited about self-driving cars. They will likely make life easier for older people and those with disabilities who cannot safely drive. They might provide better, safer, and cheaper options for people currently forced to own a car to get anywhere. Additional research and development will make them safer \xe2\x80\x94 and once the kinks are worked out, there is a likelihood that self-driving cars will be safer than human-driven ones.\n\nIn a sense, we\xe2\x80\x99re in an awkward transition moment where we want self-driving cars they aren\xe2\x80\x99t yet an uncomplicated positive.\n\nResearch and development is proceeding anyway, mostly because self-driving cars will probably be a gold mine for the first company to get them on the road. They\xe2\x80\x99ll likely be able to establish themselves in ride-hailing, taxi, and trucking markets while competitors are still struggling to catch up, and then they\xe2\x80\x99ll benefit from the additional miles traveled to further improve their cars.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not uncommon for a technology to be dangerous and barely worth it when it is first invented, only to eventually be refined into a valuable part of modern life. The first airplanes were dangerous and commercially useless, but we improved things dramatically from there.\n\n8) What role does policy play in the development of self-driving cars?\n\nThere is no federal law regarding self-driving cars. Much of the action on policy has largely taken place at the state level. And the laws surrounding self-driving cars vary enormously by state, with 29 states having passed legislation.\n\nSelf-driving car development mostly happens in the states that have been friendliest to it \xe2\x80\x94 especially California and Arizona \xe2\x80\x94 and it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to envision some states banning self-driving cars long after they become commonplace in other states, especially if the safety case for them isn\xe2\x80\x99t a slam-dunk.\n\nWhen self-driving cars were first proposed, I heard a lot of worries that regulators would unnecessarily delay their implementation. By 2016, it was obvious that hadn\xe2\x80\x99t come to pass. Indeed, in some cases regulators may have been too permissive \xe2\x80\x94 for example, in light of Uber pulling its cars and instituting new safety procedures, it seems the vehicle that killed Elaine Herzberg probably shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been on the road at all.\n\nPolicy might also shape whether self-driving cars are good or bad for the environment. With high taxes on gasoline, for example, the social costs of carbon emissions could be reflected in the price of using self-driving cars \xe2\x80\x94 and the money can be spent on climate adaptation and clean energy. But right now, our transportation policy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do much of anything about the social costs of driving, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a problem that will only get worse if self-driving cars put more people on the road.\n\n9) So just when are we getting self-driving cars?\n\nIn some senses, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been \xe2\x80\x9cclose\xe2\x80\x9d on self-driving cars for years now. Waymo is doing test runs with no one behind the wheel in Arizona, which it\xe2\x80\x99s been doing since 2017. Cruise delayed the 2019 launch of its autonomous taxi service but thinks it might happen in 2020. Earlier this year, the company unveiled a car with no steering wheel ... and no timetable for when it\xe2\x80\x99ll be available for sale. Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s periodic software updates make its Autopilot highway self-driving work better, but it remains well short of full self-driving.\n\nThere are certainly skeptics. Recently, the CEO of Volkswagen said that fully self-driving cars might \xe2\x80\x9cnever happen.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThat might be an overly harsh forecast, considering the progress that\xe2\x80\x99s been made. But it is exasperatingly difficult to get a good estimate of how long until self-driving cars happen for real for the typical American, both because no one knows for sure and because companies have incentives to publicize optimistic estimates. The companies boast about their progress but don\xe2\x80\x99t publish their mishaps. Timelines slip, and the change in plans is often publicly acknowledged only long after it\xe2\x80\x99s become obvious that the deadline can\xe2\x80\x99t be met.\n\nAt the same time, companies hesitate to put their cars on the road when there\xe2\x80\x99s any chance they aren\xe2\x80\x99t ready. They are well aware that killing someone, as Uber did, is not only horrible but also probably spells doom for their business. So there\xe2\x80\x99s ample incentive to say optimistic things and not actually launch.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not hard to imagine their arrival later this year, at least in sufficiently limited contexts; it\xe2\x80\x99s also not hard to imagine that the deadlines will be pushed out another three or four years.\n\nSelf-driving cars are on their way. They\xe2\x80\x99re closer than they were a year ago. When they\xe2\x80\x99ll actually get here is anyone\xe2\x80\x99s guess.\n\nSign up for the Future Perfect newsletter and we\xe2\x80\x99ll send you a roundup of ideas and solutions for tackling the world\xe2\x80\x99s biggest challenges \xe2\x80\x94 and how to get better at doing good.\n\nvox-mark Sign up for the newsletter Future Perfect Each week, we explore unique solutions to some of the world's biggest problems.

"416.txt";"b'It was seven years ago when Waymo discovered that spring blossoms made its self-driving cars get twitchy on the brakes. So did soap bubbles. And road flares.\n\nNew tests, in years of tests, revealed more and more distractions for the driverless cars. Their road skills improved, but matching the competence of human drivers was elusive. The cluttered roads of America, it turned out, were a daunting place for a robot.\n\nThe wizards of Silicon Valley said people would be commuting to work in self-driving cars by now. Instead, there have been court fights, injuries and deaths, and tens of billions of dollars spent on a frustratingly fickle technology that some researchers say is still years from becoming the industry\xe2\x80\x99s next big thing.\n\nNow the pursuit of autonomous cars is undergoing a reset. Companies like Uber and Lyft, worried about blowing through their cash in pursuit of autonomous technology, have tapped out. Only the deepest-pocketed outfits like Waymo, which is a subsidiary of Google\xe2\x80\x99s parent company, Alphabet; auto giants; and a handful of start-ups are managing to stay in the game.'";"Autonomous Cars";"416.txt-Autonomous Cars"
"417.txt";"b'What are the challenges with autonomous cars?\n\nFully autonomous (Level 5) cars are undergoing testing in several pockets of the world, but none are yet available to the general public. We\xe2\x80\x99re still years away from that. The challenges range from the technological and legislative to the environmental and philosophical. Here are just some of the unknowns.\n\nLidar and Radar\n\nLidar is expensive and is still trying to strike the right balance between range and resolution. If multiple autonomous cars were to drive on the same road, would their lidar signals interfere with one another? And if multiple radio frequencies are available, will the frequency range be enough to support mass production of autonomous cars?\n\nWeather Conditions\n\nWhat happens when an autonomous car drives in heavy precipitation? If there\xe2\x80\x99s a layer of snow on the road, lane dividers disappear. How will the cameras and sensors track lane markings if the markings are obscured by water, oil, ice, or debris?\n\nTraffic Conditions and Laws\n\nWill autonomous cars have trouble in tunnels or on bridges? How will they do in bumper-to-bumper traffic? Will autonomous cars be relegated to a specific lane? Will they be granted carpool lane access? And what about the fleet of legacy cars still sharing the roadways for the next 20 or 30 years?\n\nState vs. Federal Regulation\n\nThe regulatory process in the U.S. has recently shifted from federal guidance to state-by-state mandates for autonomous cars. Some states have even proposed a per-mile tax on autonomous vehicles to prevent the rise of \xe2\x80\x9czombie cars\xe2\x80\x9d driving around without passengers. Lawmakers have also written bills proposing that all autonomous cars must be zero-emission vehicles and have a panic button installed. But are the laws going to be different from state to state? Will you be able to cross state lines with an autonomous car?\n\nAccident Liability\n\nWho is liable for accidents caused by an autonomous car? The manufacturer? The human passenger? The latest blueprints suggest that a fully autonomous Level 5 car will not have a dashboard or a steering wheel, so a human passenger would not even have the option to take control of the vehicle in an emergency.\n\nArtificial vs. Emotional Intelligence\n\nHuman drivers rely on subtle cues and non-verbal communication\xe2\x80\x94like making eye contact with pedestrians or reading the facial expressions and body language of other drivers\xe2\x80\x94to make split-second judgment calls and predict behaviors. Will autonomous cars be able to replicate this connection? Will they have the same life-saving instincts as human drivers?'";"Autonomous Cars";"417.txt-Autonomous Cars"
"418.txt";"b""Imagine getting into your car, typing\xe2\x80\x94or, better yet speaking\xe2\x80\x94a location into your vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s interface, then letting it drive you to your destination while you read a book, surf the web, or nap. Self-driving vehicles\xe2\x80\x94the stuff of science fiction since the first roads were paved\xe2\x80\x94are coming, and they\xe2\x80\x99re going to radically change what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to get from point A to point B.\n\nIn 2009, Google started the self-driving car project with the goal of driving autonomously over ten uninterrupted 100-mile routes. In 2016, Waymo, an autonomous driving technology company, became a subsidiary of Alphabet, and Google's self-driving project became Waymo.\n\nSince then, Waymo has invited the public to join the first public trial of autonomous vehicles operated by the Waymo Driver and introduced its first fully autonomous vehicles operated by the Waymo Driver on public roads without anyone in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat.\n\nKey Takeaways The hype around driverless cars has grown rapidly over the past several years, with many big technology companies getting behind the concept.\n\nGoogle launched its Waymo division to develop and market consumer-ready driverless vehicles around the globe.\n\nThe company, along with several others in the tech and auto industries, is betting that driverless cars will soon change the way we get around in a major way.\n\nAmong the revolutionary changes will be safer roads, fewer fossil fuels, and lower transportation costs.\n\nBasic Technology Already In Use\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe building blocks of driverless cars are on the road now,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Russ Rader, senior vice president of communications at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf. He pointed to the front-crash prevention systems that for several years have been able to warn drivers of an impending obstacle and apply the brakes if they don\xe2\x80\x99t react fast enough.\n\nThese systems were quickly followed by technology that allows cars to self-park by sizing up a free spot and automatically steering into it, with the driver only controlling the accelerator and brake pedals. Mercedes-Benz took autonomous driving even further when they introduced Drive Pilot, which allows the driver to hand over direct control of steering and speed in certain circumstances, while still supervising the overall operation of the car.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nIn 2018, Waymo announced that they would be making self-driving cars available by 2020. However, despite some extraordinary advancements, in the year 2020, self-driving cars are still out of reach, except in some trial programs.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf The current technology on the market is limited to cars that will automatically brake for you if they anticipate a collision, cars that help keep you in your lane, and cars that can mostly handle highway driving.\n\nThe idea behind self-driving cars is fairly simple: build a car with cameras that can track all the objects around it. The car should react if it\xe2\x80\x99s about to steer into one. And once in-car computers know all driving rules, they should be able to navigate to their destination. In the end, you might say that the execution of these ideas has been more complicated than was anticipated.\n\nWaymo's cars, the leader in self-driving technology, use high-resolution cameras and lidar (light detection and ranging, which is a way of estimating the distance to another object by bouncing light and sound off things). This technology helps the self-driving car identify where other cars, cyclists, pedestrians, and obstacles are and where they\xe2\x80\x99re moving.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nA Drastic Change\n\nWith the adoption of any new revolutionary technology, it is predicted there will be problems for businesses that don\xe2\x80\x99t adjust fast enough to future developments in self-driving car technology. Futurists estimate that hundreds of billions of dollars (if not trillions) will be lost by automakers, suppliers, dealers, insurers, parking companies, and many other car-related enterprises. And think of the lost revenue for governments via licensing fees, taxes and tolls, and by personal injury lawyers and health insurers.\n\nWho needs a car made with heavier-gauge steel and eight airbags (not to mention a body shop) if accidents are so rare? Who needs a parking spot close to work if your car can drive you there, park itself miles away, only to pick you up later? Who needs to buy a flight from Boston to Cleveland when you can leave in the evening, sleep much of the way, and arrive in the morning?\n\nIndeed, one of Google\xe2\x80\x99s goals is to facilitate car-sharing.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf That means fewer cars on the road. Fewer cars, period. Who needs to own a car when you can just order a shared one and it\xe2\x80\x99ll drive up minutes later, ready to take you wherever you want?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis [has the potential to] dramatically reduce the number of cars on the street, 80% of which have people driving alone in them, and also a household's cost of transportation, which is 18% of their income\xe2\x80\x94around $9,000 a year\xe2\x80\x94for an asset that they use only 5% of the time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Robin Chase, the founder and CEO of Buzzcar, a peer-to-peer car-sharing service, and co-founder and former CEO of Zipcar.\n\nIn 2030, self-driving cars are expected to create $87 billion worth of opportunities for automakers and technology developers, said a report by Boston-based Lux Research.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf Software developers stand to win big.\n\nA Manufacturing Revolution\n\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re an automaker, such as Ford Motor Co. (F), General Motors Co. (GM), Chrysler Group LLC, Toyota Motor Corp. or Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (HMC), which account for almost 70% of the U.S. market, you could see an initial surge in the $600 billion in annual new and used car sales globally.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf \xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf But as soon as the technology takes hold, sales could fall off significantly as sharing popularizes.\n\nCars will always need steel, glass, an interior, a drivetrain, and some form of human interface (even if that interface is little more than a wireless connection to your smartphone). But much of everything else could change. As an example, take front-facing seats; they could become an option, not a requirement. Automakers that see the changes coming\xe2\x80\x94such as how the big profits are secured downstream by car servicers, insurers, and more\xe2\x80\x94are focusing on services as much as on what and how they manufacture.\n\nInfrastructure Transformation\n\nWith fewer cars around, parking lots and spaces that cover roughly one-third of the land area of many U.S. cities can be repurposed. That could mean temporary downward pressure on real estate values as supply increases. It could also mean greener urban areas and revitalized suburbs if longer commutes become more palatable. And if fewer cars are on the road, federal, state, and local government agencies may be able to reallocate a good portion of the roughly $180 billion spent annually on highways and roads.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nChanging Oil Demand\n\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re in the business of finding, extracting, refining, and marketing hydrocarbons, such as Exxon Mobil (EOX), Chevron (CVX), or BP (BP), you could see your business fluctuate as use changes.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese vehicles should practice very efficient eco-driving practices, which is typically about 20% better than the average driver,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chase. \xe2\x80\x9cOn the other hand, if these cars are owned by individuals, I see a huge rise in the number of trips, and vehicle miles traveled. People will send out their car to run errands they would never do if they had to be in the car and waste their own time. If the autonomous cars are shared vehicles and people pay for each trip, I think this will reduce demand, and thus (vehicle miles traveled).\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSafety Dividend\n\nAutonomous vehicles are also expected to be safer. \xe2\x80\x9cThese cars won't get drunk or high, drive too fast, or take unnecessary risks\xe2\x80\x94things people do all the time,\xe2\x80\x9d Chase said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOver 90% of accidents today are caused by driver error,\xe2\x80\x9d said Professor Robert W. Peterson of the Center for Insurance Law and Regulation at Santa Clara University School of Law. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is every reason to believe that self-driving cars will reduce the frequency and severity of accidents, so insurance costs should fall, perhaps dramatically.\xe2\x80\x9d\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCars can still get flooded, damaged, or stolen,\xe2\x80\x9d notes Michael Barry, vice president of media relations at the Insurance Information Institute. \xe2\x80\x9cBut this technology will have a dramatic impact on underwriting. A lot of traditional underwriting criteria will be upended.\xe2\x80\x9d\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nBarry said it\xe2\x80\x99s too early to quantify exactly how self-driving vehicles will affect rates, but added that injured parties in a crash involving a self-driving car may choose to sue the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s manufacturer or the software company that designed the autonomous capability.\n\nInitially, insurers such as State Farm Insurance, Allstate Corp. (ALL), Liberty Mutual Group, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\xe2\x80\x99s (BRK-A) GEICO, Citigroup Inc.\xe2\x80\x99s (C) Travelers Group could see a huge benefit from lower accident liabilities. But they may wind up losing a big portion of the $200 billion in personal auto premiums they write every year as fewer cars take to the road.\n\nSome experts have even speculated that mandatory insurance for cars could be dropped. And as long as we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about financial services, what about the multitude of banks and creditors that lend buyers money in about 85% of car purchases if sales volume falls?\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nAccording to a University of Texas report, if only 10% of the cars on U.S. roads were autonomous, almost $30 billion of savings could be realized via less wasted time and fuel, as well as fewer injuries and deaths. At 90%, the benefit rises to almost $120 billion a year.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nCloser to Home\n\nSelf-driving cars could have a substantial impact on the taxi and limousine industries and could potentially create new ones. Chase noted that they could be used to share specific trips, as a kind of pay-as-you-go small-scale public transportation\xe2\x80\x94for example, taking a disparate bunch of Manhattanites to the same beach in the Hamptons in one trip.\n\nOne study found that a fleet of 9,000 driverless taxis could serve all of Manhattan at about $0.50 per mile (compared to about $5 per mile now). At the time the study was published, there were licenses for over 13,000 taxis in New York City.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nSelf-driving cars may also challenge train lines. \xe2\x80\x9cA self-driving car offers much of the convenience of rail service with the added convenience that the service is portal-to-portal rather than station-to-station,\xe2\x80\x9d Peterson said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the other hand, a fleet of self-driving cars available at the station may make rail service more palatable. \xe2\x80\x9cThe technology has already been adopted in closed systems, such as campuses, air-terminals, and mining,\xe2\x80\x9d he noted. \xe2\x80\x9cRio Tinto Group (RIO), a large mining company, uses enormous self-driving trucks in its mining operations. European countries are experimenting with the platooning of trucks. Among other things, this saves about 18% in fuel.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRisks and Hurdles\n\nThere are regulatory and legislative obstacles to the widespread use of self-driving cars and substantial concerns about privacy. (Who will have access to any driving information these vehicles store?) There\xe2\x80\x99s also the question of security, as hackers could theoretically take control of these vehicles, and are not known for their restraint or civic-mindedness.\n\nThe Future of Waymo\n\nIn March 2020, Waymo Via, the trucking division of Waymo, was launched. According to Google, since 2017 Waymo Driver had been learning to drive large Class 8 trucks in the same way that it had learned how to drive passenger vehicles. Waymo is currently testing its fleet of trucks in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, and has launched a pilot program for local delivery in the Phoenix, Arizona area.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nWaymo has partnerships with multiple vehicle manufacturers to integrate its technology. In October 2020, Waymo and Daimler Trucks partnered to create an autonomous version of the Freightliner Cascadia truck. This is Waymo's first foray into the freight industry. Daimler's trucks will be equipped with autonomous technology that allows them to drive without a human but only in pre-defined areas.\xef\xbb\xbf\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nGoogle\xe2\x80\x99s Self-Driving Car FAQs\n\nIs Google Making a Car?\n\nGoogle has made it clear that it has no plans to build cars itself. Waymo is a self-driving technology company; it does not intend to manufacture and sell its own line of vehicles.\n\nWhat Year Will There Be Self-Driving Cars?\n\nEarly estimates about self-driving cars being the norm by 2020 have turned into having a few research vehicles on the road by 2020. Even if the technology is not developing as fast as expected, computer-processing capabilities and sophisticated artificial intelligence systems are becoming more advanced and more affordable every year. It's not clear when all the pieces will truly fall into place to allow for driverless technologies to safely navigate public roads among traditional cars. While experts agree that there will be a time in the future when this is true, they disagree on the timeline.\n\nHow Much Does the Google Car Cost?\n\nGoogle does not manufacture or sell its own cars. However, you can purchase a semi-autonomous Honda Civic that comes with advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) that control the steering, lane changing, acceleration, and braking while the car is cruising on the highway. You can also purchase a Tesla Motors vehicle that comes equipped with its semi-autonomous Autopilot feature.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nHowever it plays out, these vehicles are coming\xe2\x80\x94and fast. Their full adoption will take decades, but their convenience, cost, safety, and other factors will make them ubiquitous and indispensable. Such as with any technological revolution, the companies that plan ahead, adjust the fastest, and imagine the biggest will survive and thrive. And companies invested in old technology and practices will need to evolve or risk dying.""";"Autonomous Cars";"418.txt-Autonomous Cars"
"419.txt";"b'Artificial intelligence (AI) is used in a wide variety of products and services, including maps embedded on our smart phones and \xe2\x80\x9cchat bots\xe2\x80\x9d that help answer our questions on websites. Many hope that AI will transform our economy in ways that drive growth, similar to how steam engines did in the late 19th century and electricity did in the early 20th century. But it is hard to imagine that maps on smart phones, chatbots, and other existing AI-enabled services will drive the type of economic growth we saw from stream and electricity. What we need to see are some dramatic new AI-enabled products and services that transform our way of life\xe2\x80\x94in short, we are waiting for an AI \xe2\x80\x9ckiller app.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nRobert Seamans Associate Professor and Director of the Center for the Future of Management - Stern School of Business, NYU\n\nAutonomous vehicles (AVs)\xe2\x80\x94vehicles that accelerate, brake, and turn on their own, requiring little or no input from a human driver\xe2\x80\x94may be such a killer app that transforms our economy significantly. AI supports AVs in a variety of ways, including quickly processing and interpreting the large amounts of data generated by the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s cameras and sensors and helping to improve vehicle fuel efficiency and safety. The impacts of broad adoption of AVs are equally numerous, from potentially lowering transportation costs by limiting the need for drivers to possibly transforming mobility in urban and suburban environments. While the relative timing and scale of economic growth is not yet clear\xe2\x80\x94and subject to some debate among scholars\xe2\x80\x94a key step in maximizing the benefits of AVs is passing federal legislation, rather than relying on a patchwork of state and local guidelines. To inform the debate and help prepare policymakers for the task at hand, this report will examine the state of AVs, the potential for them to become a \xe2\x80\x9ckiller app\xe2\x80\x9d with broad impacts, and the existing and potential regulations that could ensure net positive effects on the economy and society as a whole.\n\nThe current state and future of AVs\n\nThe current standards for autonomous driving were developed by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE International). According to the SAE standard, the automation capability of vehicles ranges from Level 0, with no autonomy, to Level 5, which is full automation. Level 1 features include park assist, lane assist and adaptive cruise control. Some Level 3 vehicles, which include full self-driving capabilities but require human intervention in complex situations such as traffic jams, may be commercially available in 2021. No Level 4 or 5 cars, which would not require any human intervention, are yet certified for use on regular roads, though there are some such as Google\xe2\x80\x99s Waymo that are in development.\n\nWhile the potential impacts of AVs are substantial, it will take time for them to be realized; AVs are still some years from being commercially available, let alone in widespread use. To give a reasonable sense of timing, Chris Urmson\xe2\x80\x94a DARPA challenge winner, head of Google\xe2\x80\x99s Waymo autonomous vehicle unit for many years, and now CEO of a self-driving vehicle software company named Aurora \xe2\x80\x94argues it may take up to 30 to 50 years before widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles. Despite predictions to the contrary\xe2\x80\x94e.g., Elon Musk\xe2\x80\x99s 2019 prediction that there would be a Tesla driverless taxi fleet in some regions by 2020\xe2\x80\x94time frames of this magnitude are common in the automobile industry. Choe, Oettl and Seamans (2021) report that widespread adoption of new innovations in the automobile sector historically can take several decades.1 There are a number of factors that contribute to technology adoption, and even if a new technology is feasible, it may not be available at a price point that many consumers will pay. For example, turbo-charged engines, which help to reduce the amount of fuel needed, did not start to become popular until oil prices started to rise in the 1970s.\n\nIn short, the timing of adoption of AVs and the economic impacts that will follow depend on many factors. For regulators and policymakers interested in shaping what will likely be considerable economic and societal impacts of AVs, now is the time.\n\nEffect on our economy and society\n\nSupporters of autonomous vehicles argue that they may provide a variety of benefits including fuel efficiency and safety. Indeed, the Brookings Institution recently published a book on the topic (Winston and Karpilow, 2020).2 The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) argues that AVs are more fuel efficient than human-driven cars, which means fewer emissions. However, AVs may increase vehicle traffic, potentially nullifying emissions reduction from fuel efficiency. Kroger, Kuhnimhof, and Trommer (2019) project the adoption of autonomous vehicle technologies may increase vehicle traffic by 2-9 percent as a result of new automobile user groups as well as lower generalized costs of car travel.3\n\nAVs will likely be safer than human-driven cars, in large part through reducing human error which the National Highway Traffic Safety Association (NHTSA) estimates accounts for 94 percent of crashes. While widespread adoption of AVs should ultimately result in safer roads, there have been several high profile accidents involving AVs, such as a Waymo van that crashed into a car in Arizona. Perhaps as a result of some of these high-profile accidents, consumer demand for AVs seems to be relatively low. According to a 2021 survey by the American Automobile Association, only 14 percent of drivers report that they would trust riding in a vehicle that drives itself, a response similar to the 2020 survey. It is possible, however, that consumer attitudes will change once Level 4 and 5 vehicles become commercially available.\n\nAVs may help to reduce labor input costs in driving-intensive industries. However, as Gittleman and Monaco (2017) point out, there are several types of drivers, and autonomous driving will likely affect some types more than others.4 Autonomous vehicles are more likely to be used for heavy and tractor trailer truck purposes (aka \xe2\x80\x9clong haul\xe2\x80\x9d) than local delivery given the relative ease of navigating on highways and all the other tasks associated with local delivery, including freight handling, paperwork, and customer service. Gittleman and Monaco estimate that Level 4 and 5 automation may ultimately displace 300,000 to 400,000 drivers. But the authors highlight that there are many practical limitations to automation. For example, they highlight that one of the important functions of a truck driver is to serve as a security guard for the freight.\n\nA recent paper by Gelauff, Ossokina, and Teulings (2019) envisions some of the longer-term outcomes from AVs.5 The authors model two countervailing effects from AVs, each of which lead to differing outcomes on population distribution. On one hand, AVs may lead to improved use of time during car trips, which lowers the cost of living at a distance from cities. On the other hand, AVs may lead to improved public transit options in urban environments in the form of shared-ride autonomous vehicles (SAVs). The authors argue that SAVs may be more efficient than existing public transit and may make city living relatively more attractive leading to more population clustering in cities. The authors argue that the second effect may outweigh the first and ultimately may lead to overall population shifts towards large, attractive cities at the expense of smaller urban and non-urban areas. While the authors don\xe2\x80\x99t speculate on the ultimate economic effects of such a change, it is worth noting that literature from economic geography suggests that there are many agglomeration effects from living in or close to cities, including greater economic growth and innovation.6 It is also worth noting that the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a large shift in population away from many urban environments, at least in the short run.\n\nIn short, AVs will likely affect our economy and society in a variety of ways. AVs may lead to fewer emissions and increased safety. By decreasing the need for humans to drive, AVs will likely transform the type of work done by humans in the transportation sector of the economy and may also change the way that humans commute to and from work. How all this plays out, however, depends on numerous factors including, importantly, existing and future regulations.\n\nCurrent and prospective AV legislation\n\nThe National Conference of State Legislatures highlights that a number of states have introduced and enacted laws related to autonomous vehicles. Notably, in December 2020, California State Senator Ben Allen introduced a bill to establish a new Council on the Future of Transportation in California that would promote state legislation for autonomous vehicles, in addition to other transportation-related policy. Also, in November 2020 the California Public Utilities Commission approved autonomous vehicle regulatory framework that would make it easier for companies to provide autonomous vehicle transportation services to the public. While these laws indicate that state legislators are responsive to local concerns about autonomous vehicles, the risk is a resulting patchwork of state laws.\n\nWith this concern in mind, there have been attempts at federal legislation, notably in 2017 with the SELF DRIVE Act in the House and the AV START Act in the Senate. The SELF DRIVE Act (Safely Ensuring Lives Future Deployment and Research In Vehicle Evolution Act) was passed in the House in 2017 but did not advance in the Senate. The bill would have provided NHTSA with the authority to regulate AVs. NHTSA would be authorized to require safety assessment certifications and states would be preempted from enacting laws regarding the design, construction, or performance of AVs unless those laws enact standards identical to federal standards. In addition, the bill would have required that manufacturers of AVs develop written cybersecurity and privacy plans for such vehicles prior to offering them for sale. The AV START Act (American Vision for Safer Transportation through Advancement of Revolutionary Technologies Act) was introduced in the Senate in 2017 but did not advance. Like the SELF DRIVE Act, it would have established a framework for a federal role in oversight of AVs, preempting state laws and providing clarity to stakeholders including car manufacturers and insurance companies.\n\nIt remains to be seen when federal legislation on AVs will be passed, although there are promising signs. Reportedly, there is currently bipartisan support for federal legislation, notably from Republican Senator John Thune and Democratic Senator Gary Peters (who were co-sponsors of the AV START Act). While the Biden administration did not mention autonomous vehicles in its recently proposed infrastructure and jobs plan (instead focusing on electric vehicles and charging stations), Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has stated, \xe2\x80\x9cAutomated vehicle technology is coming, it\xe2\x80\x99s advancing very quickly, it is something that holds the potential to be transformative, and I think in many ways policy has not kept up.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nExisting regulatory barriers: Spectrum\n\nOne important issue to be resolved is around communication standards between autonomous vehicles. The 5.9 GHz spectrum, a 75 MHz band, had initially been set aside for use for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications in 1999, and NHTSA, car manufacturers, and device manufacturers spent the ensuing two decades working on a standard for V2V communications. However, the standard that emerged, called Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC), continues to face considerable resistance, including from a competing standard called Cellular-Vehicle-to-Vehicle (C-V2V). DSRC allows direct communication between two DSRC-enabled devices without relying on an intermediary, such as a cellular network, which in principle makes it fast and deployable in areas without cellular coverage. However, research by Gyawali et al (2020) suggests that DSRC only works well when two vehicles are in sight of each other and not moving too fast.7 C-V2V operates through a cellular network, which may limit its ability to function well in remote areas but handles communications between vehicles that are moving quickly (Gyawali et al 2020).\n\nSeparately, Wi-Fi demands have been growing, and the 5.9 GHz spectrum is increasingly being used for unlicensed Wi-Fi. A 2018 study by Rand Corporation estimated that the value of the consumer and producer surplus from using the entire band for Wi-Fi to be between $82.2 billion and $189.9 billion. In November 2019 Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Ajit Pai announced a plan whereby 45 MHz at the lower end of the band will be made available for Wi-Fi, the next 20 MHz for C-V2V, and the top 10 MHz potentially for C-V2V or DSRC. In November 2020 the FCC voted in favor of the proposal, despite objections by the Trump administration\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Transportation. There are calls for the Biden administration to reverse the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s decision. The plan would seem to bolster the C-V2V standard relative to DSRC, which may hasten resolution of the standards battle, and also favors use of Wi-Fi over transportation. It will be important for policymakers to consider the tradeoffs associated with use of the spectrum. On the one hand, demand for spectrum for Wi-Fi enabled devices is a growing and current need. In contrast, there is currently little need for spectrum for autonomous vehicles\xe2\x80\x94there aren\xe2\x80\x99t any commercially available and consumer demand seems low. On the other hand, spectrum for autonomous vehicles will likely be a future need, and the economic benefits of autonomous vehicles may outweigh the benefits of additional Wi-Fi.\n\nConclusion\n\nAutonomous vehicles will likely transform our economy, including changing the role of humans in transportation-related industries and potentially reducing emissions and increasing safety, all of which should ultimately lead to economic growth. However, large-scale adoption of autonomous vehicles and the ensuing economic growth will likely take time. The technology is still in development and consumers remain wary of autonomous vehicles. Moreover, federal and state legislation is still nascent, and there are competing standards for communication between vehicles. All of this needs to be resolved before AVs can become a \xe2\x80\x9ckiller app.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nEditor\xe2\x80\x99s Note: This paper was updated from a previous version to reflect a change in Tesla vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s SAE automation level from 3 to 2.\n\nThe authors did not receive financial support from any firm or person for this article or from any firm or person with a financial or political interest in this article.

However, the real story is the potential benefits to consumers that could come from automated vehicles. These include:\n\nFewer Crashes: According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, more than 35,000 lives were lost on U.S. highways in 2015. In addition, the economic and societal costs of collisions are a staggering $836 billion per year.

Road Use Efficiency: Autonomous vehicles will support more widespread use of car sharing, reducing the total number of vehicles on the road. Self-driving vehicles can also operate with less space between cars than is needed to allow for human driver reaction times. As a result, more vehicles can be accommodated on each mile of roadway, and could help identify specific areas for additional infrastructure.\n\nHowever, all of these benefits depend on a number of factors: achieving a critical mass of reliable autonomous vehicles that minimizes human input on driving, and creating interoperable and cooperative systems where vehicles and infrastructure can communicate in order to create more efficient traffic management, and consumer acceptance. These could be decades away.\n\nAutomated Vehicles to Hit the Road by 2020? Not So Fast\n\nWhen automakers and tech companies talk about Level 5 or fully self \xe2\x80\x93 driving vehicles, they aren\xe2\x80\x99t trying to find cars in a parking garage. Instead, modern vehicles are categorized by the level of autonomous technology they offer. Levels start at 0, for cars with no autonomous controls, and rise to Level 5 for cars that can perform all driving tasks and monitor the driving environment under all conditions in which a human driver could do the same.\n\nAutomakers and their partners, technology companies and research institutions are all working to develop self-driving technology and some experts say Level 5 vehicles could be on the road by 2020. In truth, autonomous technology exists on the road today in the form of safety features like adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking or lane keeping technologies that monitor the road and intervene when necessary.\n\nSome companies are already testing Level 4 or 5 vehicles, but these advanced technologies face technical challenges and human issues involving how drivers will interface with self-driving cars. Meanwhile, federal and state governments are determining how to adapt existing safety, licensing and liability laws and regulations to accommodate self-driving vehicles. As consumers slowly replace old cars with new cars, the U.S. will likely see a mix of vehicles with differing levels of automation on our roads for decades.\n\nAAA Q&A on Self-Driving Cars\n\nGreg Brannon has a bird\xe2\x80\x99s eye view of advancements in autonomous vehicles.

"431.txt";"b'Only a few years ago self-driving cars were no more than a vision in a science fiction movie. Today, the first partially automated vehicles with various assistance systems can already be seen on our roads. Autonomous driving is also no longer just a dream.\n\nAutonomous means that the car is fully independent in making decisions and responding to situations, including emergencies; no driver and no external intervention are needed. Enabling an even faster connection between transport systems, the 5G network will offer new application options advancing the development of autonomous cars. Not only will they be able to make autonomous decisions in the future, they will also communicate and cooperate with each other. Automated driving is the term used to describe a scenario where a fully interconnected and intelligent road transport system is created as a result of these capabilities.\n\n5G network as important foundation for autonomous driving\n\nIntelligent transport infrastructure through interconnectedness\n\nThe foundations for autonomous driving are fast and reliable communication networks, such as LTE and 5G. Therefore, Deutsche Telekom plans to install the 5G network on all key transport routes \xe2\x80\x93 such as freeways, main roads, and rail tracks \xe2\x80\x93 by 2025. Experts from various sectors are working at the 5G Automotive Association (5GAA), defining the basics for common standards in order to ensure that the new mobile communication standard meets the specific requirements for interconnecting the various transport users and for automated driving.\n\nThanks to wireless technology and internet connection, connected cars with their digital and location-related services can greatly improve our driving comfort. The car relies on regular data updates for navigation, e.g. detailed road maps, plus updates in unexpected traffic situations, such as congestion, rain, or black ice. In combination with apps for the driver and cloud systems, information for maintenance or other status reports can be retrieved and sent. Thanks to mobile edge computing, these functions are already realized today, based on LTE at a transmission rate of up to 300 megabit per second and latencies of less than 100 milliseconds, even in emergencies or remote-controlled driving at low speeds. 5G will offer even higher quality for many digital in-car services in the future.\n\n5G network expands automated systems\n\nSafety aspects are of course also a focus of attention for driving a car. In addition to the 4G capabilities, 5G offers special features for safety-relevant requirements that no other wireless network can provide.\n\nAutomated systems reach their limits when unexpected or unknown situations occur. In such a case an ""autopilot"" will decide to deactivate the system for safety reasons, if in doubt. An automated car would then return the task and responsibility of driving to the human driver. However, if the vehicle is not taken over by the driver, or not as quickly as required, then the car will be moved to the roadside in a secure driving mode.\n\nWith 5G, the car could, for instance, be controlled remotely by an external operator acting as traffic controller. The remote control through an operator is, however, definitely impossible without a 5G network, which offers key features such as very short response times and guaranteed network resources.\n\nBenefits of 5G for autonomous driving\n\nOne huge benefit of 5G is what is known as network slicing. The wireless network is subdivided into virtual network levels. One network level is then used only for automated driving, for instance. This ensures that safety-relevant notifications to self-driving cars will not end up in a traffic jam on the data highway and will be given priority over other infotainment services used in parallel.\n\nAnother benefit is the data processing and storage in data centers that are in close proximity to the transport routes. Such ""edge"" data centers ensure that data can be processed even faster in the network. In initial 5G tests on the A9 freeway between Nuremberg and Munich, latencies of less than 20 milliseconds were achieved. An autonomous car driving at a speed of 100 km/h would have traveled a mere 60 centimeters in that time. The virtual network levels and short transmission paths guarantee important quality features of the 5G mobile technology, such as low latencies and high bandwidths.\n\nSensors are used to implement car-to-car communication for automated driving. This includes, for example, intelligent camera systems, which enable the direct exchange of data between the cars. These systems have crucial physical disadvantages, however. They can neither look around corners, nor over hills, nor through obstacles. This is why they restrict the functioning of self-driving cars. This simple form of automation is also unsuitable at higher speeds.\n\nThis is where the 5G network offers another huge advantage. The mobile technology expands the scope of autonomous mobility through direct and, above all, fast and broadband data communication with cars and an appropriately equipped transport infrastructure, such as traffic lights. This can ensure improved traffic flows, for example by enabling cars to travel at higher speeds or reducing their speed in good time when necessary.\n\nAutomated driving has already begun with assisted driving\n\nThe automation of vehicles happens gradually, however. Fully automated driving, which can operate reliably in a large number of driving situations, is only the final stage of a long-lasting process. Half of all cars are already equipped with intelligent assistance systems. These are digital navigations systems, parking assistance, or speed regulation systems using cruise control as well as distance-regulation systems. Functions of an autonomous steering system for cars are already partially performed by driver assistance systems, such as steering and lane keeping assistants. Cars that can park themselves are also already available today. Despite these assistants it is the driver who remains responsible at all times. If, however, the vehicle is fully automated, the responsibility shifts from the driver to the means of transport and consequently to its manufacturer or operator. This is why many of the automation functions will at first be limited to sufficiently controllable driving situations, such as driving at lower and medium speeds on freeways or parking in a demarcated parking space.\n\nAutomatism creates personal freedoms\n\nHumans use automated functions in their day-to-day lives mainly in order to save time, which can then be used in a more meaningful or convenient way. So in the future \xe2\x80\x93 as mere passengers in self-driving cars \xe2\x80\x93 making use of mobile networks, we will surely be able to read the latest news on our smartphones or tablets, participate in video conferences or work, use entertainment services or shop online while on the move.

Automated vehicles could eliminate the majority of these crashes.\n\nWhile automated vehicle systems require much more testing and validation before they are ready for commercial deployment, engineers are working to ensure they drive safely, closely follow traffic laws, and respond appropriately to changing road conditions. Automated vehicles do not get distracted and can monitor their environment in 360-degree, high-precision 3D.\n\nAutomated vehicles can also provide increased mobility to seniors, children, people with disabilities and others who are unable or choose not to drive. They could operate more efficiently than conventional vehicles, reducing congestion and emissions.\n\nSAE, the Society of Automotive Engineers, identified six levels of vehicle automation starting with Level 0, or no automation whatsoever, through Level 5, in which the vehicle has complete control. SAE, the Society of Automotive Engineers, identified six levels of vehicle automation starting with Level 0, or no automation whatsoever, through Level 5, in which the vehicle has complete control.\n\nYou might already be driving a vehicle that is above Level 0.

Volkswagen is planning a self-driving microbus with Argo AI by 2025, while Ford said in February it plans to invest $29 billion in autonomous and electric vehicles through 2025.\n\nFord and Argo AI have been testing fleets nationwide in Austin; Detroit; Miami; Palo Alto, California; Pittsburgh; and Washington, D.C.'";"Autonomous Cars";"437.txt-Autonomous Cars"
"439.txt";"b'By Erick Guerra\n\nAlthough technological, financial, and regulatory hurdles remain, fully autonomous vehicles will likely be driving themselves on city streets and highways in the next 20 years \xe2\x80\x94 well within a long-range planning horizon. Major car manufacturers already market and sell high-end vehicles with features like automated braking, self-parking, lane-departure warning, and variable-speed cruise control. Most are racing to develop fully autonomous vehicles \xe2\x80\x94 as are technology firms like Google and Uber \xe2\x80\x94 and nearly half a dozen states have passed laws allowing testing of driverless vehicles on public roads. (Current regulations require a human operator behind the wheel of an autonomous test vehicle, but these regulations are likely to change as the technology advances.)\n\nSelf-driving cars will have a number of social and economic effects. In addition to freeing drivers to engage in tasks other than driving, autonomous vehicles promise to reduce traffic collisions by removing humans, and thus human error and negligence, from behind the wheel. By allowing closer platooning and lowering the number of collisions, self-driving vehicles will also increase effective road capacity, particularly on highways.\n\nSince the initially steep upfront costs of driverless vehicles can be offset by lower labor costs, the freight, transit, and taxi industries could be early adopters of driverless technologies, affecting the country\'s 4.5 million bus, taxi, and truck drivers \xe2\x80\x94 mostly men with high school degrees or less, a demographic that has not fared well in the recent recession or the larger digital revolution.\n\nSelf-driving cars also could have profound, though highly uncertain, impacts on sustainability and urban form, two areas of particular interest to city and regional planners.\n\nTwo scenarios\n\nWhether self-driving cars reduce harmful emissions or the amount of land, energy, money, and other resources consumed by the transportation system depends largely on whether they reduce car ownership and driving. Optimists envision a future where driverless cars lead to a revolution in shared urban mobility. Why own a car when you can summon one to pick you up while avoiding the worries of parking, insurance, or maintenance?\n\nIn this scenario, the shift in ownership will also encourage payment based on miles driven and time of day rather than lumpy vehicle purchases, insurance fees, and parking. Instead of thinking about how much gas is in the tank, travelers will now consider the full marginal cost of a car trip when deciding whether to walk, bike, drive, or take transit. Transit service may also improve as a result of shared cars and minivans operating on fixed and flexible routes.\n\nThe biggest opportunity for improvement is in cities and neighborhoods where densities are currently too low to justify frequent bus or rail service. If shared or public, self-driving cars will dramatically reduce the demand for parking. Even privately owned vehicles will drop off passengers at front doors before driving off-site or behind a building to park, thus decoupling parking from other urban land uses. This would allow cities to dedicate more space to housing, shops, and offices, as well as stormwater management, street trees, and other sustainable features.\n\nPessimists, by contrast, see vehicle automation as one more technology that makes driving more comfortable and convenient and thus increases the amount that people drive. In this scenario, most households will own one or more self-driving cars, send their vehicles to run errands, circle to avoid paying for parking, and treat travel as if it had zero or very low time costs.\n\nMany cars may become full-time mobile offices, whisking people between meetings, and the number of workers commuting between metropolitan regions will almost certainly increase. Making long commutes more productive will support the growing trend in long-duration commutes. Between 1990 and 2010, the proportion of commuters traveling more than 60 minutes and more than 90 minutes to work increased from six to eight percent and 1.6 to 2.5 percent, respectively.\n\nSelf-driving cars will also expand personal mobility for the third of the population without drivers\' licenses and the tenth of households without cars due to age, disability, low income, or preference. A demonstration video of one of Google\'s prototype self-driving cars features a legally blind man riding to a Taco Bell in a self-driving vehicle.\n\nExpanded access to cars may be particularly important for the nation\'s elderly, many of whom live in and would like to remain in car-dependent communities. In this scenario, even if self-driving cars double existing capacity, this capacity will fill quickly \xe2\x80\x94 encouraging dispersed development and greater land consumption, which would further erode any sustainability benefits from increased efficiency.\n\nGlass half full or half empty?\n\nWhose view is more realistic \xe2\x80\x94 the optimists\' or the pessimists\'? Both may be partially correct. Net effects will vary across states, cities, and neighborhoods. In dense urban areas with good transit where the demand for space and shared mobility is higher, driverless cars will tend to increase density and improve transit. In sprawling areas, self-driving cars will encourage more sprawl by making it easier to live farther from employment centers and other destinations. Urban cores will likely concentrate while peripheral areas expand. Suburban areas will probably continue to rely on privately owned vehicles but could see improvements in transit and shared mobility.\n\nWhat can planners do to prepare for driverless vehicles? The new technology could produce rapid and radical changes to metropolitan transportation systems, particularly freight and transit. However, the timing, scale, and direction of the impacts are uncertain and the opportunities to influence outcomes are limited. For better or worse, major changes to passenger travel might be slow to materialize \xe2\x80\x94 the technology remains expensive and the vehicle fleet turns over slowly (the average passenger car is just over 11 years old). Some 15 years after the commercial release of the Toyota Prius, hybrid vehicles make up only a tiny share of the U.S. car fleet.\n\nRegardless, planners should pay close attention to the technology, start thinking about which regulations (particularly on-site parking requirements) could change quickly in response to new technologies, and perhaps redirect capital investments away from infrastructure-heavy projects with a long lifespan to shorter term, more flexible projects that are insulated from some of the uncertainty around the timing and impacts of self-driving cars.\n\nErick Guerra is an assistant professor of city and regional planning at the University of Pennsylvania, where his research focuses on the relationships between transportation infrastructure, land use, urban development, and travel behavior.\n\nWeb-Only Expanded Sidebar\n\nRead ""Attention: The Age of Automation Is Right Ahead,"" an expanded version of the article that appeared in the printed magazine.\n\nResources\n\nImage: This early prototype of Google\'s self-driving car was designed to go from point A to point B without human intervention.

"44.txt";"b'The California Department of Motor Vehicles said this week it\xe2\x80\x99s reviewing whether Tesla is telling people that its cars are self-driving when, legally speaking, they\xe2\x80\x99re not. This follows fatal crashes that may have involved its Autopilot feature. Tesla advertises a \xe2\x80\x9cFull Self-Driving\xe2\x80\x9d upgrade option. One man has been busted in Teslas more than once for reckless driving. He hangs out in the backseat and steers with his feet.\n\nMeanwhile, no cars are fully self-driving yet. I spoke with Missy Cummings, the director of the Humans and Autonomy Laboratory at Duke University. She says the so-called deep learning that cars need to see the road around them doesn\xe2\x80\x99t actually learn. The following is an edited transcript of our conversation.\n\nMissy Cummings (Photo courtesy Duke University)\n\nMissy Cummings: I can show a convolutional neural net a million images of a stop sign, and it will learn what a stop sign is from those images. But if it sees a stop sign that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t match exactly those images, then it can\xe2\x80\x99t recognize it. And this is a huge problem, because if a strand of kudzu leaves starts to grow across just the top 20% of a stop sign, that is enough to make that algorithm be dumb, and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t recognize it, because it\xe2\x80\x99s never seen a stop sign with one strand of kudzu leaves across it.\n\nMolly Wood: Is there an awareness of this, do you think? Is everybody sort of still trying to push the same solution when it comes to self-driving cars? Are people starting to realize these limitations and internalize them and change their approach at all?\n\nCummings: I think there are three camps of people not just in self-driving, but in robotics and artificial intelligence in general. There\xe2\x80\x99s the camp of people like me who know the reality. We recognize it for what it is, we\xe2\x80\x99ve recognized it for some time, and we know that unless we change fundamentally the way that we\xe2\x80\x99re approaching this problem, it is not solvable with our current approach. There\xe2\x80\x99s another larger group of people who recognize that there are some problems but feel like with enough money and enough time, we can solve it. And then there\xe2\x80\x99s a third group of people that no matter what you tell them, they believe that we can solve this problem. And you can\xe2\x80\x99t talk them off that platform.\n\nChange the approach to the problem\n\nThe people who are the biggest problem are the people in that second group, the ones that believe that with enough time and money, we can fix it, instead of recognizing the elephant in the room for what it is, which is not fixable under our current approach. And this is why you see companies like Starsky, a trucking company that went out of business, and you starting to see all the mergers across the automotive industry where all companies are either teaming up with each other or with software companies, because they realize that they just cannot keep hemorrhaging money the way they are. But that pit still has no bottom. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t see this becoming a viable commercial set of operations in terms of self-driving cars for anyone anywhere, ever, until we address this problem.\n\nWood: What about the tests that seem to be going fine, like Waymo testing fully operating taxis in Phoenix with no support drivers and not having crashes?\n\nCummings: Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s interesting to me that that\xe2\x80\x99s your perception, because that\xe2\x80\x99s the perception that Waymo wants you to have. But the reality is behind every self-driving car in Phoenix, there are a team of humans that are remotely monitoring and potentially intervening when the systems go down. And there was recently a video that went viral on YouTube, where a Waymo car in its fully self-driving mode got stuck by a single orange cone. And eventually, they had to send a team of people to put a human in the car and drive the poor passenger out of the conundrum that he was in. And this is very recent. And you have to ask yourself, if we are having a car that supposedly is fully self-driving, so there\xe2\x80\x99s no driver, but we have to have a team of four to six people managing that one car for problems. First of all, that\xe2\x80\x99s not scalable.\n\nIntervention needed\n\nAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s not really self-driving if there has to be so much intervention. And if that\xe2\x80\x99s where we are in technology today, how are we going to make a business out of this? And John Krafcik, the former CEO of Waymo, I mean, he recently left. I feel like John, in that way, was basically admitting what I have been trying to tell people all these years, is that we just can\xe2\x80\x99t solve this problem in the way that you think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to. We need to completely clean sheet this and start over.\n\nWood: So when we see Uber and Lyft, for example, essentially exiting this self-driving car business, do you think it is a sign of companies who have sort of said \xe2\x80\x9cthis is just a money pit\xe2\x80\x9d?\n\nCummings: Yes, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly right.\n\nWood: On the other hand, we have Tesla, which is not doing any of that. What are we to make of that?\n\nCummings: Well, I think the Tesla situation is a little different. Should they be allowed to call their driving assist technology Full Self-Driving? So that\xe2\x80\x99s one problem. And then, if you want to ask, is Tesla ever going to have a robotaxi program? I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you, that answer is no. But that problem is less acute for Tesla, because they have what is otherwise a great product. I love Tesla cars. I just think Autopilot and especially Full Self-Driving are both overhyped, and they underdeliver in terms of performance, and they\xe2\x80\x99re dangerous.\n\nWood: So there\xe2\x80\x99s a math problem and there is a pretty significant marketing problem?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe religion of Tesla\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nCummings: That\xe2\x80\x99s right. So I think that we\xe2\x80\x99re starting to see increasing numbers of crashes in this country and abroad, where drivers think that their car is far more capable. I think what is interesting to me was how the Tesla driver who got arrested for being in his backseat while he was driving vocalized that he\xe2\x80\x99d already been warned once, and he defied the warning and did it again, and then said he would keep doing it because he knows Elon [Musk] knows what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing. And he fully believes in Tesla.\n\nAnd so what I find most interesting about that statement is that one man is vocalizing what so many people believe. They believe that this technology really can be fully self-driving, despite all the warnings and despite all the statements and the owner\xe2\x80\x99s manual, and you having to agree that you\xe2\x80\x99re going to pay attention. Despite all of those warnings, there\xe2\x80\x99s some belief likely based in calling a technology Full Self-Driving and calling it Autopilot where people believe in the religion of Tesla full self-driving, and that is dangerous.\n\nRelated links: More insight from Molly Wood\n\nTesla\xe2\x80\x99s website does call the upgrade option Full Self-Driving, but also says the cars can\xe2\x80\x99t drive themselves. Back in March, a Tesla engineer told the DMV that despite Elon Musk\xe2\x80\x99s claims that the company would have a fully self-driving car by the end of this year, that claim did not match the engineering reality. For a refresher, there are five agreed-upon levels of autonomous driving, where No. 1 is you driving your car with your hands and feet, and No. 5 is the car doing everything while you sleep in the back seat in a way that does not endanger you or everyone around you. The Tesla engineer told the DMV, according to a memo produced by the agency, that Tesla is currently at level 2 \xe2\x80\x94 some self-driving functionality, but requiring a human with hands on the wheel at all times.\n\nHere is a column about deep learning and why that author also thinks the tech is too limited to be able to adapt to real-world conditions, because the algorithms would have to pre-learn every single possible thing that could happen on the road \xe2\x80\x94 from a kudzu stop sign to a spaceship landing on the freeway. There\xe2\x80\x99s also a little more reading and listening on Uber and Lyft getting out of the self-driving game. Marketplace\xe2\x80\x99s Meghan McCarty Carino covered that on the \xe2\x80\x9cMarketplace Morning Report.\n\n\n\nApple might still be working on this \xe2\x80\x94 maybe?

Earlier this week, MacReports noted that Apple has increased the number of self-driving cars it\xe2\x80\x99s registered with the DMV from 66 to 68, but dramatically decreased the number of people licensed to operate those cars. And it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t applied for a driverless testing permit. Apple has been flirting off and on with self-driving cars for a few years now. First it laid off almost everyone involved with its so-called Project Titan, and then it bought a self-driving car startup that was almost defunct.

See detailed requirements.\n\nComputer Vision In this course, you will develop critical Machine Learning skills that are commonly leveraged in autonomous vehicle engineering. You will learn about the life cycle of a Machine Learning project, from framing the problem and choosing metrics to training and improving models. This course will focus on the camera sensor and you will learn how to process raw digital images before feeding them into different algorithms, such as neural networks. You will build convolutional neural networks using TensorFlow and learn how to classify and detect objects in images. With this course, you will be exposed to the whole Machine Learning workflow and get a good understanding of the work of a Machine Learning Engineer and how it translates to the autonomous vehicle context. Object Detection in an Urban Environment\n\nSensor Fusion In this course, you will learn about a key enabler for self-driving cars: sensor fusion. Besides cameras, self-driving cars rely on other sensors with complementary measurement principles to improve robustness and reliability. Therefore, you will learn about the lidar sensor and its role in the autonomous vehicle sensor suite. You will learn about the lidar working principle, get an overview of currently available lidar types and their differences, and look at relevant criteria for sensor selection. Also, you will learn how to detect objects such as vehicles in a 3D lidar point cloud using a deep-learning approach and then evaluate detection performance using a set of state-of-the-art metrics. In the second half of the course, you will learn how to fuse camera and lidar detections and track objects over time with an Extended Kalman Filter. You will get hands-on experience with multi-target tracking, where you will learn how to initialize, update and delete tracks, assign measurements to tracks with data association techniques and manage several tracks simultaneously. After completing the course, you will have a solid foundation to work as a sensor fusion engineer on self-driving cars. 3D Object Detection Sensor Fusion\n\nLocalization In this course, you will learn all about robotic localization, from one-dimensional motion models up to using three-dimensional point cloud maps obtained from lidar sensors. You\xe2\x80\x99ll begin by learning about the bicycle motion model, an approach to use simple motion to estimate location at the next time step, before gathering sensor data. Then, you\xe2\x80\x99ll move onto using Markov localization in order to do 1D object tracking, as well as further leveraging motion models. From there, you will learn how to implement two scan matching algorithms, Iterative Closest Point (ICP) and Normal Distributions Transform (NDP), which work with 2D and 3D data. Finally, you will utilize these scan matching algorithms in the Point Cloud Library (PCL) to localize a simulated car with lidar sensing, using a 3D point cloud map obtained from the CARLA simulator. Scan Matching Localization\n\nPlanning Path planning routes a vehicle from one point to another, and it handles how to react when emergencies arise. The Mercedes-Benz Vehicle Intelligence team will take you through the three stages of path planning. First, you\xe2\x80\x99ll apply model-driven and data-driven approaches to predict how other vehicles on the road will behave. Then you\xe2\x80\x99ll construct a finite state machine to decide which of several maneuvers your own vehicle should undertake. Finally, you\xe2\x80\x99ll generate a safe and comfortable trajectory to execute that maneuver.

"454.txt";"b'Sensor Integration\n\nComponents like radar, LiDAR and cameras are used to provide the distance to objects that surround the vehicle. If the exact location of the surrounding objects is known, this technology can provide the absolute vehicle location with assistance from a high amount of map data. When integrated with complimentary technology such as: ultrasonic, inertial motion, digital maps, radar/LiDAR and cameras, GNSS acts as the sixth sense to deliver the positioning performance required by autonomous vehicles.\n\nMany technologies onboard vehicles provide local or relative localization. GNSS provides an absolute localization solution, and with the following technologies can achieve the accuracy and availability requirements of a full autonomous driving solution.\n\nSPAN\xc2\xae GNSS+INS Navigation\n\nWith the growing developments in automotive technology, the need for accurate, reliable and robust ground reference has emerged. Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) + Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) are an essential component of achieving high accuracy ground truth, mobile mapping and real-time precise positioning for autonomy. NovAtel delivers SPAN\xc2\xae GNSS+INS technology in easy-to-integrate packages designed to determine truth trajectories and benchmark your autonomous solution.\n\n\n\nWhy use SPAN?\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh Rate Data:\n\nUsers have access to high-rate, smooth solutions, essential for high-speed freeway/highway driving.\n\nAccuracy and Flexibility:\n\nWhen combined with Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) corrections and post-processing, SPAN offers the best possible solution even through tunnels and ultra-challenging urban canyon situations. Flexibility of the system allows for the addition of a wheel sensor and other external inputs to further refine your solution.\n\nHardware Robustness:\n\nInternal logging and multiple communication interfaces allow for customized utilization and flexibility when integrating into test vehicles.\n\nInterference Toolkit\n\nThe Interference Toolkit (ITK) provides the functionality to monitor, quantify and remove those unintentional interference sources that impact receiver performance. ITK has built-in features to pre-survey demonstration sites, scan for possible interference sources within the vehicle and remove interference.\n\nITK includes two main components:\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Spectrum analysis output:\n\nPlot signal levels on the vertical axis over a range of frequencies on the horizontal axis. The spectral analysis tools show how much signal power is being sensed across the different GNSS frequency bands. When an interference signal is present it can be visualized in the spectral analysis plot.\n\n2. Advanced signal processing and digital filtering:\n\nMitigate and remove interference with built-in software, applied signal processing and digital filters. These processing techniques suppress interference, allowing the GNSS signals to track and the receiver to continue to operate normally.\n\nWhy use ITK for Ground Truth?\n\nTo pre-survey demonstration areas to identify and remove possible sources of interference\n\nTo identify interference sources within the vehicle\n\nTo remove interference with built-in filters\n\nWaypoint\xc2\xae Post-Processing\n\nWaypoint Software provides an ideal solution for applications that require accurate post-mission position, velocity or attitude. Post-processing with Waypoint maximizes the accuracy of the ground truth trajectory by processing forward and reverse in time, backsmoothing and combining the results. It provides the ability to assess the solution reliability and accuracy with extensive quality analysis and plotting tools.\n\nWhy use Waypoint for Ground Truth?\n\nIt maximizes accuracy of GNSS+INS test trajectories\n\nIt provides the ability to offset and transform between reference datums\n\nExport profiles are customizable to meet varying needs\n\nReal-time and post-processed quality can be compared\n\nIt is easy to export to Google Earth for test review\n\nGNSS Corrections\n\nGNSS signals, without corrections, provide positioning accuracy of five to ten meters (16-32 feet). Corrections can be generated by a number of sources or methods, and system developers must choose the corrections method that best meets the demands of their application.\n\nCorrections work in combinations with multi-frequency measurements from the GNSS to provide sub-decimeter to centimeter-level accuracy \xe2\x80\x93 depending on the correction source.'";"Autonomous Cars";"454.txt-Autonomous Cars"
"455.txt";"b'An autonomous vehicle, or a driverless vehicle, is one that is able to operate itself and perform necessary functions without any human intervention, through ability to sense its surroundings.\n\nAn autonomous vehicle utilises a fully automated driving system in order to allow the vehicle to respond to external conditions that a human driver would manage.\n\nWhat are the 6 Levels of Autonomous Vehicles?\n\nThere are six different levels of automation and, as the levels increase, the extent of the driverless car\xe2\x80\x99s independence regarding operation control increases.\n\nAt level 0, the car has no control over its operation and the human driver does all of the driving.\n\nAt level 1, the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s ADAS (advanced driver assistance system) has the ability to support the driver with either steering or accelerating and braking.\n\nAt level 2, the ADAS can oversee steering and accelerating and braking in some conditions, although the human driver is required to continue paying complete attention to the driving environment throughout the journey, while also performing the remainder of the necessary tasks.\n\nAt level 3, the ADS (advanced driving system) can perform all parts of the driving task in some conditions, but the human driver is required to be able to regain control when requested to do so by the ADS. In the remaining conditions, the human driver executes the necessary tasks.\n\nAt level 4, the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s ADS is able to perform all driving tasks independently in certain conditions in which human attention is not required.\n\nFinally, level 5 involves full automation whereby the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s ADS is able to perform all tasks in all conditions, and no driving assistance is required from the human driver. This full automation will be enabled by the application of 5G technology, which will allow vehicles to communicate not just with one another, but also with traffic lights, signage and even the roads themselves.\n\nOne of the aspects of the vehicle technology used in automated vehicles is ACC, or adaptive cruise control. This system is able to adjust the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s speed automatically to ensure that it maintains a safe distance from the vehicles in front of it. This function relies on information obtained using sensors on the vehicle and allows the car to perform tasks such as brake when it senses that it is approaching any vehicles ahead. This information is then processed and the appropriate instructions are sent to actuators in the vehicle, which control the responsive actions of the car such as steering, acceleration and braking. Highly automated vehicles with fully automated speed control are able to respond to signals from traffic lights and other such non-vehicular activities.\n\nWhat are the Advantages?\n\nAutonomous vehicle technology may be able to provide certain advantages compared to human-driven vehicles. One such potential advantage is that they could provide increased safety on the road \xe2\x80\x93 vehicle crashes cause many deaths every year, and automated vehicles could potentially decrease the number of casualties as the software used in them is likely to make fewer errors in comparison to humans. A decrease in the number of accidents could also reduce traffic congestion, which is a further potential advantage posed by autonomous vehicles. Autonomous driving can also achieve this by the removal of human behaviours that cause blockages on the road, specifically stop-and-go traffic.\n\nAnother possible advantage of automated driving is that people who are not able to drive \xe2\x80\x93 due to factors like age and disabilities \xe2\x80\x93 could be able to use automated cars as more convenient transport systems.\n\nAdditional advantages that come with an autonomous car are elimination of driving fatigue and being able to sleep during overnight journeys.'";"Autonomous Cars";"455.txt-Autonomous Cars"

"460.txt";"b'Commuting time might even be dramatically reduced if different activities could be done virtually from home. Further to this, what will actually be transported in self-driving vehicles is another interesting question. With a steep expansion in ecommerce, the flow of goods in cities is suited to smaller vehicles. The traditional logistic systems will be challenged by this development, and self-driving vehicles might be used to transport goods when not transporting people. Therefore self-driving cars, to some extent, may replace trucks in order to improve parcel delivery for transport companies with a need for micro logistics around a city.\n\nIn the 2014 Ericsson ConsumerLab report, Connectivity Beyond the Screen, 67 percent of smartphone owners said they were interested in a same-day delivery service that works on any device, online and in stores. As an example of this, Amazon is gradually expanding its same-day and one-day delivery services (that initially started in the US) to many cities across the world, with Toronto in Canada being the most recent addition.13 Furthermore, Amazon has also started a rideshare-like delivery service called Amazon Flex, where drivers deliver parcels in a similar setup to companies such as Uber.14\n\nWhile autonomous vehicles may mean that those who love driving will get to do it less, there will be many other benefits to people both inside and outside the car.

"466.txt";"b'As of early 2021, multiple rumors have suggested that Apple has entered into negotiations with well-known automative electronics suppliers for components for a potential upcoming vehicle-related product, and Apple is also said to be working to establish a production facility in the United States.\n\nApple was rumored to be cosidering a partnership with Hyundai for manufacturing the Apple Car, with plans to transition the Apple Car development to its Kia brand as part of an arrangement that could see production happen in the United States, but that hasn\'t panned out.\n\nRumors suggested that under the partnership with Hyundai, Hyundai Mobis would be in charge of design and production for some Apple Car components, and Hyundai Group affiliate Kia would provide the U.S. production line for Apple Cars. Hyundai executives were said to be divided over the prospect of a deal with Apple, though Apple planned to invest 4 trillion won ($3.6 billion) in Kia Motors, with Kia set to manufacture the Apple Car in its U.S. facility located in Georgia.\n\nApple reportedly considered Hyundai-Kia because the deal would give Apple access to an established automaker with the capability to produce vehicles in North America. Hyundai-Kia was also willing to give Apple control over both the Apple Car software and the hardware, with Apple planning for a full Apple-branded vehicle and not a Kia model that included Apple software.\n\nDespite all the rumors of an Apple/Hyundai-Kia partnership, Apple paused the talks and has also been discussing Apple Car plans with other automobile manufacturers. According to Bloomberg, Apple was upset that Hyundai confirmed that it was in talks with Apple even though Hyundai eventually retracted and revised the statement.\n\nHyundai and its Kia affiliate confirmed in February 2021 that they are not in discussions with Apple to cooperate on the development of a self-driving electric vehicle, so it appears the discussions between Apple and the two car manufacturing companies may have been tabled for now. It\'s not clear if the talks will resume, but some Korean media sites do believe that the partnership could survive and Apple could opt to go with Kia.\n\nApple also allegedly approached Nissan about a potential partnership, but negotiations were brief and did not make it up to executive levels due to disagreements over Apple Car specifics. The two companies clashed over the idea of a partnership, with Nissan worried that Apple would downgrade it to a simple hardware supplier. Apple wants full control over the Apple Car\'s design and software, and Nissan has said that it has no plans to change the way that it makes cars. Nissan has since confirmed that it is not in talks with Apple.\n\nAccording to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple\'s initial vehicle chassis could be based on Hyundai\'s E-GMP electriv vehicle (BEV) platform, which uses up to two motors, five-link rear suspension, an integrated drive axle, battery cells that can provide range over 500km on a full charge, and can be charged up to 80% within 18 minutes through high-speed charging. A high performance model based on E-GMP is capable of accelerating from 0-60 miles per hour in less than 3.5 seconds, with a top speed of 160 miles per hour.\n\nApple may also work with General Motors and European manufacturer PSA for subsequent models or in other markets. Apple\'s ""deep collaboration"" with manufacturing partners will shorten Apple car development time.\n\nBloomberg\'s Mark Gurman has explained that Apple is struggling to find an appropriate existing automaker to build its vehicle and automakers are said to be concerned about the implications of such an agreement on their own brand. As a result, Apple is reportedly looking into contract manufacturers such as Foxconn, which has an existing relationship with the company.\n\nFoxconn is the main assembler of iPhones, and also recently unveiled an electric vehicle chassis and a software platform to help carmakers bring models to market faster. Contract manufacturer Magna is purportedly another possibility, but Apple may also choose to manufacture the vehicle itself.\n\nAccording to The Korea Times, Apple is ""very near"" to signing an agreement with LG Magna e-Powertrain. Apple is apparently comfortable with LG Magna e-Powertrain\'s smaller manufacturing capacity, from which it may be inferred that the company does not intend to produce the vehicle on the same large scale as other major automakers. Apple\'s first-generation of electric vehicles is reportedly seen as an opportunity to evaluate the project\'s marketability, rather than a true mass-market vehicle.\n\nIf the agreement with LG Magna e-Powertrain is reached, the two parties will then jointly establish the precise details for the production of the Apple car, and a prototype will apparently be teased in early 2024.\n\nApple in June 2021 entered into ""early-stage talks"" with two Chinese companies that might supply batteries for a future Apple Car. Apple is discussing battery options with CATL and BYD, with Apple pushing for the building of manufacturing facilities in the United States.\n\nApple may instead be planning to work with Taiwanese manufacturers on batteries that are could be made in the U.S. Taiwan-based Foxconn and Advanced Lithium Electrochemistry both plan to set up factories in the United States that could end up manufacturing batteries for the Apple Car.\n\nApple in 2021 also sent a team of Apple Car employees to South Korea to meet with LG, the SK group, and others to discuss possible business opportunities related to the Apple Car. Apple is continuing to work to find new partners to join its supply chain for the upcoming vehicle. Apple is pursuing companies who can make lithium iron phosphate batteries, which Korean suppliers mass produce.\n\nApple in September was rumored to be visiting Toyota as talks to find and secure suppliers continue.'";"Autonomous Cars";"466.txt-Autonomous Cars"
"467.txt";"b""Two of Apple's self-driving cars operating in manual mode were involved in minor collisions in August, according to the California DMV.\n\n\n\nThe first incident [PDF] occurred in San Diego, California in the Hillcrest area on August 19. The Lexus RX 450h was stopped in traffic and was hit by a Hyundai. The accident was described as minor with no injuries.\n\nThe second accident [PDF] occurred on August 23 in Cupertino, California, right near the Apple Park campus. The vehicle with Apple's self-driving equipment was in manual mode and it was stopped in traffic when it was rear ended by a Subaru Outback.\n\nBoth of these incidents were not the fault of the self-driving vehicle or the person operating the vehicle, and are largely not notable. What is interesting, though, is that Apple vehicles were involved in two collisions in the same month after no accidents since September 2019.\n\nEarlier this year, the California DMV's disengagement and mileage reports suggested that Apple's Lexus SUVs with self-driving software traversed more than 18,000 miles in 2020, a steep increase compared to prior years. It's possible that Apple has ramped up its testing in 2021, leading to a higher number of incidents.\n\nApple has been testing its self-driving software since early 2017, using the aforementioned Lexus RX 450h vehicles outfitted with sensors and cameras.

"468.txt";"b'Last Updated 9/222020\n\nAccording to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA),""autonomous"" or ""self-driving"" vehicles are those in which operation of the vehicle occurs without direct driver input to control the steering, acceleration, and braking and are designed so that the driver is not expected to constantly monitor the roadway while operating in self-driving mode. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers predict that 75% of cars on the roads in the world will be autonomous by 2040. Moreover, a 2018 KPMG Study predicts that self-driving cars may become a commercial reality in the next five years.\n\nGoogle is the pioneer in autonomous driving technology. In 2005, Google established a team of engineers, led by Sebastian Thrun, who developed a robotic vehicle that won a contest sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Since 2009, Google (now Waymo), has been test-driving autonomous vehicles on public roads, traveling more than 10 million miles in over 25 U.S. cities. According to previous crash reports, Waymo cars have been in numerous minor accidents, but only one accident in 2016, was reported to be the fault of Google\'s self-driving car. In 2017, the company removed monthly accidents reports from their site and they will no longer be publicly available.\n\nWaymo continues to be the industry leader in driverless technology. In December of 2018, the company officially launched Waymo One, the nation\xe2\x80\x99s first autonomous vehicle taxi service, in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nGoogle believes that self-driving cars can make driving more efficient and safer by eliminating distracted driving and other human error. According to NHTSA, 3,166 fatalities in 2017 were crashes involving distracted drivers, while an additional 10,874 fatalities involved an alcohol-impaired driver. A KMPG report predicts that by 2050, the adoption of autonomous vehicle technology could reduce the frequency of accidents by almost 90%.\n\nAs excitement and momentum for self-driving cars grows, there are numerous insurance questions that will need to be addressed before such vehicles take the road. For example: What happens if a self-driving car gets into an accident? Who is liable for the damages? Will the human ""copilot"" be at fault or will the car\'s manufacturer? Will the \'driver\' have to maintain a constant vigil on the road ahead at all times? What are they allowed to do inside the vehicle\xe2\x80\xa6can they nap, read a book or text message while the car does all the navigating? Will they even need a driver\'s license? A 2017 KMPG report highlights the ""chaotic middle"" the auto insurance industry is facing in this new period.\n\nThere is also a long list of safety and legal issues to iron out before self-driving cars hit the road. In September 2017, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) presented, Automated Driving Systems: A Vision for Safety, as part of U.S. Department of Transportation\'s (DOT) multimodal efforts to support the safe introduction of automation technologies. In July 2018, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) released the Comprehensive Management Plan for Automated Vehicle Initiatives as a response to the requirements in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (Omnibus Bill) signed into law on March 23, 2018, directing the (DOT) to conduct research on the development of Automated Vehicles (AV).\n\nCurrently, twenty-nine states and Washington D.C. have enacted legislation related to autonomous vehicles, while eleven governors issued executive orders regarding autonomous vehicles. Getting the technology to make the vehicles is only half the challenge; the other half will be creating a legal, liability and regulatory framework to govern their use on public streets.\n\nStatus: The NAIC Innovation and Technology (EX) Task Force is charged with monitoring emerging technologies like autonomous vehicles in the insurance sector. The Task Force provides a forum for discussion of innovation and technology developments in the insurance sector to provide resources for and educate state insurance regulators on how these developments impact consumer protection, insurer, and producer oversight. Additionally, the NAIC Center for Insurance Policy and Research (CIPR) held an Autonomous Vehicle forum in October 2018. Resources from this forum are available on the CIPR Events page. The CIPR also hosted a webinar, The Road Ahead for Autonomous Vehicles and Auto Insurance in December 2019. Both of these events provided insights on the future of insurance in the autonomous vehicle industry.'";"Autonomous Cars";"468.txt-Autonomous Cars"

Complex sensors and actuators, together with advanced computer vision functions are used to create a constantly updated map of their surroundings, detect the presence of nearby vehicles and pedestrians, measure distances and detect uneven surfaces in roads and sidewalks. Autonomous vehicles can also be interconnected with other external devices such as smart traffic lights and roads, although many of these ideas are still hypothetical.\n\nAn autonomous vehicle is a vehicle that can drive itself without input from a human driver. There are several types of self-driving vehicles, depending on their level of automation. These levels have been defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) which has set 6 of them adopted by the U.S. Department of Transportation ranging from Level 0 (fully manual) to Level 5 (fully autonomous).\n\nTechopedia Explains Autonomous Vehicle\n\nIn some ways, the story of the autonomous vehicle is a tale of technological evolution that is not finished yet, a gradual advance of integrated artificial intelligence services and sensor-based driver safety features that may or may not eventually replace human drivers entirely.\n\nAutonomous cars must rely on the presence of sensors situated in various parts of the vehicle to sense their surroundings. Lidar is mostly used for ranging purposes, measure distances, identify lane markings and anomalies such as holes and pits on the road.\n\nRadar sensors are used to track other vehicles, while video cameras can be used to read road signs and detect traffic lights. Advanced AI-powered software will then process all those inputs coming from sensors, and generate instructions to the car\xe2\x80\x99s actuators to plot paths, control steering, braking and acceleration, or dodge obstacles.\n\nEarly Advances in Autonomous Vehicles\n\nThe earliest edge of the autonomous driving frontier was the evolution of multiple driver safety features that are now standard in many new vehicles. For example, a lane departure warning system alerts drivers if the vehicle seems to be leaving a particular space on a multilane road. Parking assist features, automated braking, and other features also apply. Each one has its own specialized function and controls a given task.\n\nWhat these systems have in common is that, although they promote the idea of autonomous vehicle design, they still do not approach what some would call a self-driving car. The human driver is still in control, and needs to be in control, but utilizes the warnings and alerts to make better driving decisions.\n\nThese forms of partial automation that still require a human driver pertain to the SAE levels 0 to 2. Only when the automated system is in charge of monitoring the driving environment and human intervention is purely optional then a vehicle could be defined as \xe2\x80\x9cautonomous\xe2\x80\x9d (levels 3 to 5). As we progress toward autonomous vehicle design, intermediate types of autopilot systems are becoming more common, with Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s one being probably the most prominent.\n\nObstacles to Adoption of Autonomous Cars Technology\n\nFully autonomous (Level 5) vehicles are currently being tested, but we\xe2\x80\x99re still far from making them available to the general public. Although the autonomous vehicle has come a long way, it is not yet a common mode of transportation, and various obstacles to adoption apply.\n\nIn particular, some of the technologies required for build a functional self-driving car very expensive, making the final cost of each vehicle prohibitive for the general public. Radar and Lidar work for prototypes, but if mass production is achieved, their signals and frequency might interfere with one another.\n\nMany anomalous conditions such as snow, debris or oil may represent a significant challenge whenever they cover lane markings and dividers. Also, it\xe2\x80\x99s still early to trust AI to be smart enough to make consistent decisions or split-second judgement calls in life-or-death scenarios, such as when a pedestrian suddenly traverses the road after a steep turn.'";"Autonomous Cars";"472.txt-Autonomous Cars"

Learn why this has hundreds of software teams building their applications in the cloud across multiple use cases and industries.\n\nPresented by Pony.ai\n\nThe vision of safe, reliable autonomous vehicle transportation at scale is closer than ever to being realized, says James Peng, CEO at Pony.ai. Since the company\xe2\x80\x99s founding in Fremont, California in late 2016, the company\xe2\x80\x99s been making strides in autonomous mobility deployment in both the U.S. and China. The company was the first to launch and offer a public-facing Robotaxi service in both countries.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe technology is moving from experience-level to application,\xe2\x80\x9d Peng says. \xe2\x80\x9cThe first half of the game is to build stable and mature products and accumulate experience. The second half is to move from R&D to mass production and scale, in addition to achieving commercially viable products.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn 2019, Peng predicted that the world would see a wide adoption of fully autonomous driving vehicles on the open roads within five years, and that forecast is gaining momentum. Pony.ai just received a driverless permit from California DMV, a milestone for their engineers to perform driverless testing without a human driver behind the wheel on public roads within the state. These tests are accelerating commercial growth across their operation sites worldwide, and they plan to launch driverless Robotaxi service to the public in California starting in 2022.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m pretty confident that in many of the larger cities in the U.S., people will soon be able to ride with a driverless Robotaxi vehicle,\xe2\x80\x9d says Tiancheng Lou, CTO at Pony.ai. \xe2\x80\x9cA significant portion of taxi services will be supported by driverless vehicles.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPony.ai currently offers ride-hailing in its autonomous vehicles in five markets: Irvine and Fremont in California; as well as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou in China. The company plans to install its technology in hundreds of vehicles next year, rising to tens of thousands in 2024-2025.\n\nWaymo, Google\xe2\x80\x99s self-driving car arm, has been piloting a fleet of fully driverless robotaxis in Phoenix for the past year, while Amazon-owned Zoox unveiled its autonomous robotaxi service last December.\n\nThe goals of autonomous driving\n\nAccording to most companies, the biggest benefit of autonomous driving is safety. The U.S. Department of Transportation has reported that 94% of car crashes are caused by human error. While overall driving was down in 2020 because of the pandemic, traffic fatality rates surged 24% \xe2\x80\x94 the highest spike in nearly a century. Autonomous driving is the solution to this issue, Peng says, and companies like Pony.ai, Google, and Uber, along with most of the major automakers, are sinking considerable money into R&D, optimistic about the future of autonomous driving.\n\nA transition to autonomous vehicles also has potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and support U.S. economic growth, points out the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets. The coalition, which includes members Ford, Volvo, Lyft, Uber, and Waymo, promotes the benefits of fully self-driving vehicles and supports the fastest deployment possible \xe2\x80\x93 or advancing the scale of the technology, which would enable mass production and start moving autonomous vehicles to the center of the smart city vision.\n\nChallenges of driving autonomy at scale\n\nPony is hoping to achieve large enough scale to reduce costs and meet commercial needs by 2022 with Alpha X, the working name for their latest generation of autonomous vehicles, Lou says, which are designed to be manufactured on a production line.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo have a large number of vehicles, we need to manufacture them in a standardized way,\xe2\x80\x9d Lou says. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a critical step to achieve front-loading mass production of self-driving cars.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe company established a production line and a set of standardized processes specifically for L4-level autonomous driving systems last November. With the support of the production line, the production efficiency of the autonomous driving system doubled six times compared with the previous generation, and production pace accelerated.\n\nWith PonyAlpha X, they established a L4 level autonomous driving system scale production line, Lou says. To manufacture the vehicle, they established a supply chain management process, hardware module design and verification, test production, and car conversion before final assembly. The end phase consists of overall quality inspection, off-line calibration, and road testing. The project helps them set up a standardized production process, which shortened production time, effectively reduced costs, and improved the stability of the overall system.\n\nCompared with the previous generation, PonyAlpha X is more compact, integrated, and lightweight in terms of system hardware integration, reducing the cost of post-maintenance. They recently partnered with Toyota to equip PonyAlpha X on Lexus RX models.\n\nIn February of this year, the company rolled out the new self-driving vehicles equipped with the latest generation system from the standardized production line. The cars will go through all-day autonomous-driving open-road tests in Guangzhou, Beijing, and Shanghai before they join the company\xe2\x80\x99s Robotaxi fleet for large-scale operations.\n\nTheir recent partnership with Luminar, an autonomous vehicle sensor and software company, has also allowed them to significantly bring down the cost of manufacturing, which is always a major hurdle for mass production.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the next generation, one of the biggest challenges is we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to use auto-grade sensors,\xe2\x80\x9d Lou says. \xe2\x80\x9cOne of the critical pieces is Luminar LiDAR. Using that LiDAR, we\xe2\x80\x99re moving one step toward to being ready for mass production, and then we can prepare for large scale production. Luminar LiDAR, compared to our current solution, is more reliable and much cheaper.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLiDAR is a laser sensor that sends millions of laser points out per second and measures how long they take to bounce back, a key component to safe autonomous driving. Luminar says that its Iris LiDAR has a maximum range of 500 meters (1,640 feet), including 250-meter range with less than 10 percent reflectivity. The self-driving sensor solution offers better perception accuracy and field of view breadth to enhance the ability to cope with long-tail scenarios. The new pony vehicles with Luminar\xe2\x80\x99s LiDAR sensor will be up and running in 2022, and will be ready for the company\xe2\x80\x99s robotaxi customers in 2023.\n\nAutonomous driving at scale is, literally, in sight\n\nThe past year hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been easy, Lou says, but it pushed their contactless delivery initiative further along in Irvine, which helped the community cope during the pandemic, while adding testing and collecting mileage for data points. But full autonomy at scale still requires testing.\n\nTo help accelerate their commercial growth and global deployment, they\xe2\x80\x99ve tapped Lawrence Steyn, vice chairman of investment banking at JPMorgan Chase & Co, as chief financial officer.\n\nAnd looking ahead, in 10 years or 20 years, it could be possible that owning a vehicle would entirely be a luxury, Lou says.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe need to carefully think about whether that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary, having personal vehicles,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it\xe2\x80\x99s mathematically possible to get a vehicle within as little as 30 seconds, most people may not have to own a vehicle.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe also points out that if most vehicles are running autonomously, the vehicle form factor can be reshaped for accessibility, opening up safe transportation for a larger population of older and disabled riders who could turn to cheaper, more efficient autonomous transportation for their travel needs.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI still keep the engineering part in me, and with that part, I dream of pushing the world forward with state-of-art technology,\xe2\x80\x9d Peng says. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are working hard to largely scale and deploy our technology across countries and regions to benefit more and more people.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDig deeper.

"476.txt";"b'These Vehicles Can Almost Drive Themselves There is no such thing as a self-driving car. Let\xe2\x80\x99s make that clear right away, not a single car on the road today can operate in all types of weather and driving conditions without any human intervention. That type of vehicle, one with what\xe2\x80\x99s called Level 5 autonomy (which we\'ll explain in further detail later), remains years into the future. This doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean many cars on sale today don\xe2\x80\x99t have impressive technology that\xe2\x80\x99s making them increasingly smarter and safer. Some of these driving aids are targeted at reducing driver stress, by taking over some or all steering functions, or automatically matching the car\xe2\x80\x99s speed to posted road signs. Certain systems, like Cadillac\xe2\x80\x99s Super Cruise, can only be used within specific parameters, such as pre-mapped divided highways with dedicated on- and off-ramps. There are also a number of active safety features, such as automatic emergency braking, that help minimize the risk of an accident by stopping the car if sensors detect an obstacle. While the era of robot cars hasn\xe2\x80\x99t yet arrived, let\xe2\x80\x99s look at examples of self-driving technology available today.\n\n<h3><strong>What Are the Levels of Vehicle Autonomy?</strong></h3> <p>To make things as simple as possible, let\xe2\x80\x99s explain the five levels of vehicle autonomy before we look at the cars and SUVs on this list. The levels of autonomy are determined by SAE International, a professional group of worldwide engineers devoted to establishing standardized values for the transportation field. To better understand self-driving cars, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand each level of autonomy.</p> <p>Level 0 means the car is always under human control. Cars in this category can have active safety features, like automatic emergency braking and forward collision warning, but these features only offer visual or audible alerts, and they never actively control the car.</p> <p>Level 1 vehicles might include adaptive cruise control or lane keep assist. These safety features are capable of providing a small degree of steering, acceleration, or braking input. However, their primary focus is accident avoidance. </p> <p>Level 2 autonomy entails several active safety features working in unison to take some degree of driving duty away from the driver. Onboard cameras and radar sensors could keep the car driving at a steady speed in its intended lane of travel, for example, and clear of surrounding vehicles. At this level you\xe2\x80\x99ll find a number of today\xe2\x80\x99s self-driving systems, such as Cadillac Super Cruise and Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s AutoPilot. One key thing to remember: A Level 2 vehicle requires the driver to remain focused on the road. This can be done via cameras that monitor the driver\xe2\x80\x99s eyes or sensors that can tell if the driver lets go of the steering wheel.</p> <p>At Level 3, a vehicle takes over all driving controls in select conditions and allows the driver to focus elsewhere. These conditions might be specific types of highway, or geofenced locations. The vehicle may not be able to drive itself in poor weather.</p> <p>At Level 4, the self-driving car is able to adapt to more road and weather conditions. The limitations of Level 3 are lessened, and the vehicle theoretically requires almost no driver input.</p> <p>Finally, at Level 5, the car drives all the time, no matter the type of road or weather outside. This robo-car is the end game for self-driving technology, though it remains years into the future.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>2020 Tesla Model S</strong></h3> <p><strong>Price w/ Autonomous Driving Features: $69,420 | U.S. News Overall Score: 9.0/10</strong></p> <p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s start with the car company and electric-powered sedan that put self-driving technology on the map. True, the idea of robo-cars didn\xe2\x80\x99t start with Tesla, but the Silicon Valley-based automaker has put them front and center in terms of cutting-edge car technology. </p> <p>Every <a href=""/cars-trucks/tesla/model-s/2020"">Model S</a> is fitted with Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s AutoPilot self-driving aid, though you can upgrade to the Full Self-Driving Capability package for an extra $8,000. While AutoPilot maintains vehicle speed and keeps the Model S in its intended lane of travel, Full Self-Driving Capability allows for lane changes (if the sensors detect it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to do so), automatic parking assist, and a mode to summon the car from a parking spot. </p> <p>Tesla remains at the forefront of this technology, though the company\xe2\x80\x99s reputation has been dinged by high profile accidents while its vehicles were operating with some degree of autonomy. This has often been linked to driver inattention, though the fact that AutoPilot usage is not geo-fenced to certain roads \xe2\x80\x93 such as the next system we\xe2\x80\x99re going to discuss \xe2\x80\x93 has been a heated safety topic.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>2020 Cadillac CT6</strong></h3> <p><strong>Price w/ Autonomous Driving Features: $74,495 | U.S. News Overall Score: 7.2/10</strong></p> <p>While Tesla has adopted a more free-spirited attitude to self-driving assistance, the Cadillac Super Cruise system takes a more measured approach. Like Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s AutoPilot, when Super Cruise is in operation the car maintains its speed, distance to other vehicles, and adheres to its intended lane of travel. </p> <p>Unlike some rival lane keep assist technology, Super Cruise is credited for being very smooth and avoiding the \xe2\x80\x98ping-pong\xe2\x80\x99 feel that other systems cause as onboard sensors read and respond to lane markings. This is a hands-free system, but a camera in the interior keeps an eye on the driver to make certain they\xe2\x80\x99re looking ahead and paying attention. If that isn\xe2\x80\x99t the case, Super Cruise will issue a series of visual and audible alerts. Should this still not get the driver\xe2\x80\x99s attention, the car will turn on its hazard lights and slow to a stop in its lane of travel.</p> <p>Available on the <a href=""/cars-trucks/cadillac/ct6/2020"">CT6</a> luxury sedan in the Premium Luxury trim level, Super Cruise can only be activated on divided highways with dedicated on-ramps and off-ramps. </p> <p>As of this writing, roughly 130,000 miles of roads throughout North America have been programmed into Super Cruise. For the 2021 model year, this technology will be available in the new <a href=""/cars-trucks/cadillac/escalade/2021"">Escalade</a> full-size SUV, along with the <a href=""/cars-trucks/cadillac/ct4/2020"">CT4</a> and <a href=""/cars-trucks/cadillac/ct5/2020"">CT5</a> sedans.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>2020 Nissan Rogue</strong></h3> <p><strong>Price w/ Autonomous Driving Features: $28,670 | U.S. News Overall Score: 7.6/10</strong></p> <p>Nissan takes a slightly simpler approach with its self-driving technology.

ProPilot offers more of a gentle nudge in corners, though sharper bends will cause it to default back to the driver\'s control. </p> <p>Nissan touts ProPilot Assist as a way to relieve daily driving stresses and it will feature in more models in the years ahead. A more advanced ProPilot Assist 2.0 system is also on the road, though it\xe2\x80\x99s not yet in the U.S. market.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>2020 BMW X7</strong></h3> <p><strong>Price w/ Autonomous Driving Features: $75,600 | U.S. News Overall Score: 7.7/10</strong></p> <p>The <a href=""/cars-trucks/bmw/x7/2020"">BMW X7</a> is the German automaker\xe2\x80\x99s largest SUV and one of several models in which you can order hands-free parallel parking assist, along with traffic jam assist.

With the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s speed under 40 mph, a notification appeared that the system\xe2\x80\x99s pilot mode was available. Then with the push of a button on the steering wheel, the car took control and the instrument cluster graphic changed to an illustration of the road with vehicles in the lanes.\n\nAs Giesler took his hands off the wheel and his foot off the pedals, the vehicle seamlessly followed the car in front at a safe distance. When a vehicle cut into our lane, the A7 automatically slowed down and adjusted the distance. When that car moved out of the lane, our car again closed the gap with the next car in front. The driver can turn off the system at any time by placing his hands on the steering wheel and foot back on the pedals.\n\nWith the A7 in control, the driver could do other things, although sleeping was not one of them. The vehicle was equipped with two cameras with facial recognition that monitored the driver\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. Giesler showed off that feature in an unnerving moment. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to lie to you, this is still pretty scary for me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said as he pretended to sleep. After about 10 seconds the vehicle noticed. An audible alert sounded and, when he still didn\xe2\x80\x99t open his eyes, the vehicle shut down in the middle of the highway and activated the hazard lights. That is a safeguard on the prototype A7 in case the driver is ill or incapacitated. But production cars will be designed so that they can make autonomous lane changes, which will allow the vehicle to safely pull off the road.\n\nDuring the demonstration, Giesler pointed out an eye-opening reminder of how quickly the technology is advancing. The previous year the test car\xe2\x80\x99s trunk was filled with three desktop-sized computers to make the system work. This year the hardware had been reduced to the size of a small box, which was tucked away in the trunk\xe2\x80\x99s side storage compartment.\n\nOverall we were quite impressed with the Audi\xe2\x80\x99s capabilities. The company expects the technology to be available in a production car within five years.'";"Autonomous Cars";"479.txt-Autonomous Cars"

The company, a division of Intel (INTC), describes NYC as \xe2\x80\x9cone of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most challenging driving environments\xe2\x80\x9d and says the data from the trial will push full self-driving capability closer to prime time.\n\nIn an interview, Mobileye CEO Amnon Shashua said fully autonomous cars could be in showrooms by the end of President Biden\xe2\x80\x99s first term. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have contracts underway with car makers for the 2024 or 2025 time frame,\xe2\x80\x9d Shashua told Yahoo Finance. \xe2\x80\x9cA level 4 vehicle can be purchased by a consumer at a very, very reasonable add-on cost.\xe2\x80\x9d Level 4 is the second-highest level of vehicle autonomy and it means a driver is never needed.\n\nSystems on the market today, including Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s Autopilot and General Motors\xe2\x80\x99 Supercruise, are Level 2 autonomy, which means computers can control steering and speed but the driver needs to be ready to intervene if necessary. Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s system has been controversial because of several fatal crashes that occurred with Autopilot engaged. Drivers may have mistakenly thought the system could avoid all hazards, which it\xe2\x80\x99s not yet designed to do. The Transportation Department\'s safety agency is investigating at least 30 Tesla crashes involving 10 deaths.\n\nMobileye\xe2\x80\x99s CEO Amnon Shashua poses with a Mobileye driverless vehicle at the Nasdaq Market site in New York, U.S., July 20, 2021.

Tesla is developing its own system. Most automakers, including General Motors (GM) and Ford (F), use proprietary in-house technology along with systems provided by suppliers such as Mobileye. Autonomous vehicles are complex and a handful of sophisticated firms will probably end up dominating the market, which is likely to be lucrative.\n\nShashua sees robotaxis arriving before self-driving cars consumers buy at dealerships. Mobileye, which was an Israeli company before Intel bought it for $15 billion in 2017, has permission to operate driverless taxis in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, most likely by the end of 2022, and in Munich as well.

Robotaxis may also be easier to regulate, through rules governing their use inside a fixed geography such as a city\xe2\x80\x99s boundaries. Driverless cars for consumers probably need the ability to go virtually anywhere, plus some regulatory guidance that isn\xe2\x80\x99t yet fully developed. Level 4 autonomy could add $10,000 to $15,0000 to the cost of a vehicle, though that should come down as the technology scales up.\n\nThe United States isn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily ahead on autonomous vehicles. \xe2\x80\x9cI think China and Germany are in the lead position,\xe2\x80\x9d Shashua says.

"483.txt";"b'The age of autonomous or self-driving cars is slowly creeping up on us and, with each new year that passes, semi-autonomous technology is getting better and better as we inch toward the day when human driving could be outlawed altogether. With that said, a recent report provided by Cox Automotive points out that 84-percent of people surveyed would still prefer the option of driving themselves, leaving just 16-percent of those surveyed willing to give up full control. To make matters worse, the overall acceptance of self-driving technology over the last two years has fallen by 18-percentage points. That probably, at least in part, comes thanks to recent high-profile autonomous car accidents, like the fatal accident with one of Uber\xe2\x80\x99s self-driving cars. As such, it\xe2\x80\x99s not surprising that automakers are scrambling to prove that their autonomous technology is safe \xe2\x80\x93 we can always trust them, right?\n\nIn the video you see below, BMW has chosen one of its autonomous test vehicles with the co-star being none other than a scary-looking ghost in the woods. Naturally, the self-driving car stops in the middle of the road, long before it could run over the scary ghost because, you know, self-driving technology is just that good. As the video proceeds, the ghost opens the car door to find nobody in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat, gets scared, and scurries off into the woods like a very naughty mouse that was caught in your kitchen cupboard. Then we see the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cNOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF\xe2\x80\x9d flash across the screen.\n\nThis video can be seen in one of two ways. The way BMW wants you to see it is that its self-driving technology is so good that it can even stop for a lifeless entity in the middle of a dark wooded road in the middle of the night \xe2\x80\x93 a place where no car (or driver for that matter) really has any business being anyway. That\xe2\x80\x99s great- BMW\xe2\x80\x99s self-driving tech will stop for anything. Not that I\xe2\x80\x99d want my car to stop for a ghost, ghoul, goblin, or any other form of the undead \xe2\x80\x93 can you imagine how useless autonomous cars would be in a zombie apocalypse? Anyway, YAY; it is super safe.\n\nI, on the other hand, look at this video a completely different way. First off, why was this self-driving car in the middle of the darkest, creepiest looking wooded road in the middle of the night? Maybe the car had gone rogue after the passenger stopped to take a leak. A brave soul that would have been. But, I digress. I think the real message here is that even ghosts \xe2\x80\x93 the leftover souls of those that once walked this earth \xe2\x80\x93 are scared of self-driving technology. Now, that, my friends, is something to take note of. If a creepy ghost walking down a dark road in the middle of the night, with clear intentions of scaring the hell out of someone, is scared of self-driving cars, then shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we be scared of them as well?

"486.txt";"b'TOKYO -- Prices of one key type of the sensors used in autonomous cars are falling rapidly, raising hopes of accelerating progress in the development of self-driving technology.\n\nVelodyne Lidar, the leading manufacturer of lidar sensors, has developed a product with a price only one-hundredth of those up until now. This dramatic drop in price for the sensors at the heart of many autonomous car designs could rev up the speed of the evolution of self-driving vehicles.\n\nMost of today\'s autonomous vehicles are equipped with two key types of sensors: cameras and radars.\n\nSensors using lidar (light detection and ranging) work like radar systems, with the only difference being that they use laser light instead of radio waves.\n\nLidar technology uses near-infrared light to detect objects around a vehicle. The advantage of lidar is that it can generate precise three-dimensional images of everything from cars to traffic lights to pedestrians in a wide range of environments and under diverse lighting conditions.\n\nHonda Motor\'s new self-driving Legend luxury sedan, equipped with the world\'s first certified Level 3 autonomous driving technology, uses lidar sensors.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk, however, has famously disparaged lidar sensors, saying in 2019 that they are ""expensive sensors that are unnecessary"" and likening them to ""a whole bunch of expensive appendices.""\n\nMusk has shown such distaste for lidar technology mainly because lidar sensors have been so costly, with a system for one vehicle costing as much as $70,000. He has argued that sophisticated cameras are sufficient for self-driving cars\' vision systems.\n\nIndeed, the biggest hurdle to widespread lidar adoption has been an economic one.\n\nBut technological innovation has significantly undermined the assumption underlying Musk\'s argument.\n\nVelodyne CEO Anand Gopalan told Nikkei that Musk\'s view of lidar technology is ""five, six years out of date.""\n\nGopalan asked whether it is wise to rely on just one component for safety. ""If you\'re driving at 70 miles per hour, or 100 kilometers per hour, you\'re taking your hand off the steering wheel and you\'re shutting your brain off ... can you rely on just one sensor?"" he said.\n\nAs the costs of lidar sensors decline, they can be combined with cameras to create truly safe and affordable vision systems, he asserted. ""If lidar can become small and low-cost, [it will help] create a safe system.""\n\nMany major carmakers have apparently agreed. Velodyne\'s customer list includes Volkswagen and Honda.\n\nVelodyne CEO Anand Gopalan holds the company\'s new palm-size lidar unit.\n\nWhen Google initially started its autonomous vehicle research, it used custom-made lidar sensors from Velodyne. They were rotating models mounted on the roof.\n\nVelodyne has sharply reduced lidar production costs by developing solid-state lidars. This new approach has helped shrink the size of the sensors, eliminate moving parts in the optical mechanisms and enable the kind of mass manufacturing that has brought costs down.\n\nThe company\'s new model, its smallest so far, could be sold at around $100 in high-volume production. A sensor system composed of multiple lidars is capable of 360-degree vehicle coverage.\n\nAs the costs of making lidars fall further through mass production, the total cost of lidars per vehicle will likely fall sharply. ""Past 2025, I think you will see the cost of lidars come down even more, in the $700 range"" per vehicle, Gopalan said.\n\nLuminar Technologies, a U.S. vehicle sensor and software startup, has also developed low-priced lidar sensors priced at $500 to $1,000.\n\nLuminar\'s high-performance lidar sensors can accurately detect objects ahead of the car out to 250 meters away and grasp the situation around the vehicle with a perception accuracy of several centimeters. The sensors can also detect dark objects, like black debris or a person wearing black clothes, even on roads with minimum reflectivity.\n\nGermany\'s Daimler, Sweden\'s Volvo Cars, the Israel-based Intel unit Mobileye and Toyota Motor\'s research arm have adopted Luminar\'s lidar sensors for their self-driving prototypes.\n\nLuminar CEO Austin Russell stresses the crucial importance of focusing on safety in developing self-driving technologies. One accident per 100 people is not acceptable, Russell told Nikkei. The goal should be ""to have 99.99999999% -- 10 nines of reliability,"" he said.\n\nRussell was a child prodigy who memorized the whole periodic table at age 2 and made a cellphone on his own while he was an elementary school student. He obtained a patent for a water recycling system he invented when he was 13.\n\nUnder the guidance of billionaire Peter Thiel, a co-founder of PayPal, Russell founded Luminar at the age of 17. Following Luminar\'s listing on Nasdaq in December 2020 through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) -- a shell company that uses the proceeds from an IPO to acquire a private company -- he became a billionaire at age 25.\n\nBesides Luminar, more than five other U.S. lidar startups, including California-based Aeva, have gone public via a SPAC merger.\n\nIn recent years, progress in autonomous driving technology has been markedly slower than that for electric vehicles. One reason has been a rush of major automakers to expand their EV offerings in response to a global trend toward stricter regulatory restrictions on gasoline-powered cars aimed at reducing carbon emissions.\n\nAs their earnings have been battered by the COVID-19 pandemic, carmakers have concentrated their investment on electric vehicles while cutting their R&D spending on self-driving technology.\n\nThe walls of national regulations and high costs have also hampered the advancement of autonomous driving technology. But growing competition among Velodyne and its rivals to develop more accurate and less expensive lidar sensors could help the technology overcome these challenges and come into widespread use.\n\n""Various parts with falling prices, such as sensors and cameras, will help remedy shortcomings [of autonomous driving],"" said professor Toshio Ito at the Shibaura Institute of Technology, an expert in advanced driver assistance systems.\n\nA small number of players, mainly U.S. and Chinese tech companies, are dominating the self-driving business landscape due primarily to its high technological and financial hurdles.\n\nGeneral Motors\' autonomous driving subsidiary, GM Cruise; Waymo, which began as Google\'s self-driving car project; and China\'s Baidu are leading the pack in terms of testing self-driving cars on public roads in California and other parts of the U.S. They have covered far more distance than Daimler or Toyota.\n\nIn a notable strategic move by another tech giant, Amazon acquired the autonomous vehicle startup Zoox to develop driverless delivery vehicles.\n\nApple is another tech powerhouse that is raising its self-driving profile. Since 2017, the Palo Alto, California-based company has been test-driving its own models on public roads around its headquarters. According to documents the company submitted in the past to the state authority, Apple has been testing a Lexus-based self-driving vehicle. A Lexus equipped with self-driving systems provided by DeepRoute.ai, a Chinese company, has been spotted in the area.\n\nVelodyne\'s Gopalan welcomes entries by tech companies like those affiliated with Google\'s parent, Alphabet, and Apple into the mobility sector.\n\n""Their appetite to adopt new technologies like lidar ... is much faster than a traditional automotive [manufacturer]. And so their entry into the space has really forced the rest of the industry to innovate,"" he said.\n\nThese U.S. and Chinese tech companies, armed with not just accumulated test-driving data but also ample financial and human resources, are likely to remain on the leading edge of the self-driving revolution.'";"Autonomous Cars";"486.txt-Autonomous Cars"

"490.txt";"b'Friday, June 25, 2021\n\nDespite all the hype, fully self-driving cars are not yet commercially available to the public. In limited geographical areas, individuals can sometimes be passengers in these vehicles. However, mastering the technology behind these cars has proven highly costly, and a wider rollout has taken much longer than expected.\n\nEven Tesla, who offers an \xe2\x80\x9cAutopilot\xe2\x80\x9d feature and boasts that their cars can run by themselves, admits (sometimes) that there needs to be a human at the controls. This is partly because of the accidents that continue to occur when people allow the car to do what it promises to do: drive itself. Clearly, safety continues to be a significant concern.\n\nIn April of this year, a Tesla vehicle was involved in a fatal crash that killed two people. Just before the drive, eyewitnesses said that the parties left to test-drive the vehicle without a driver utilizing Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s Autopilot feature.\n\nTesla claims the accident occurred because there was no one behind the wheel. The company says they include a warning on when and where to use this feature in the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s manual. They also state on their website that active driver supervision is required, yet they continue to advertise the Autopilot feature as autonomous.\n\nSo, before we examine who\xe2\x80\x99s at fault if you\xe2\x80\x99re involved in an accident with a driverless car, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand the complexities surrounding self-driving cars, from what defines the term to current regulations and the latest developments in the industry.\n\nWHAT ARE SELF-DRIVING VEHICLES?\n\nThe terms \xe2\x80\x9cself-driving,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdriverless,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cautonomous\xe2\x80\x9d are often used synonymously, although there are important distinctions.\n\nSelf-driving vehicles have been assigned levels of autonomy by the NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration). Most cars on the road today operate at Level 1, where there are some autonomous functions such as cruise control or Lane-Keep Assist. It\xe2\x80\x99s worth noting that the NHTSA recently updated their descriptions of Levels 4 and 5 to include a greater degree of autonomy and lack of human intervention.\n\nThere has been some reluctance for people to grab onto the self-driving concept. However, according to forecaster Scott Hardman, as driving becomes more automated, people will drive more, based on his interviews with 35 Tesla BEV with Autopilot owners. Those interviewed perceived less stress and increased comfort associated with partial automation.\n\nIn the meantime, technology is moving forward amidst hope, some trepidation, and, most of all, confusion.\n\nESSENTIAL SELF-DRIVING VEHICLE STATS\n\nExact statistics about driverless vehicles are difficult to get due to the lack of mandates on reporting accidents and the lack of industry-wide standards, where confusion abounds. Nevertheless, here are some important numbers worth considering:\n\nMore than 80 companies are testing over 1,400 self-driving cars in the U.S.\n\nAbout half of the population familiar with self-driving cars say they would be willing to ride in them.\n\nThe Tsukuba Mechanical Engineering Laboratory in Japan launched the first primitive, semi-automated car in 1977.\n\nGoogle\xe2\x80\x99s self-driving car first crashed into a bus in February of 2016; there were no injuries.\n\nTesla autonomous vehicles have been involved in several accidents. The first accident that resulted in death occurred in Florida on May 7, 2016.\n\nThe first Uber self-driving car crash occurred on November 20, 2018, in Tempe, Arizona. The cause was human error and resulted in the death of pedestrian Elaine Hezerberg.\n\nUber was involved in 37 crashes prior to the fatal accident in 2018.\n\nWaymo, the self-driving division of Google parent company Alphabet, Inc., partnered with the trucking giant J.B. Hunt and began hauling commercial loads on Texas highways with Level 4 autonomous big-rig vehicles in March of 2020.\n\nWaymo has also been running a driverless taxi service in the Phoenix, Arizona area since 2018. In May of this year, one of these Waymo taxis got confused in Chandler, Arizona traffic and took off on its own. Fortunately, no one was injured.\n\nLyft predicts autonomous rides could arrive by 2023.\n\nMany experts say driverless cars are safer than those driven entirely by human operators. Regardless, accidents have occurred and will continue to take place for many reasons. But if you\xe2\x80\x99re involved in a driverless car accident, who\xe2\x80\x99s at fault? Do you have any recourse?\n\nWHO\xe2\x80\x99S TO BLAME IN A CRASH?\n\nThe blame, or cause, of the accident, can be murky at best and may rest with more than one party. That\xe2\x80\x99s why it is essential to have a professional and experienced personal injury attorney on your side to accurately assess the situation, interpret the data, and consult the right experts to support your case and present it properly to the court.\n\nWHAT TO DO IF YOU\xe2\x80\x99RE IN AN ACCIDENT WITH A DRIVERLESS CAR\n\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re involved in an accident of any kind, you\xe2\x80\x99ll want to seek medical help as soon as possible.

This situation highlights the difficulties facing the automated vehicle industry, which has gotten billions of dollars in investor money over the past decade.\n\nIn the past year, self-driving startups like Cruise and Pony.ai have begun testing their driverless cars in some parts of California. These cars have human operators.\n\nThe human is not \xe2\x80\x9cdriving,\xe2\x80\x9d but sitting in the passenger seat. Called a safety operator, the human ""has a red button that can stop the vehicle just in case anything happens,"" Pony.ai CEO James Peng told the Reuters news agency.\n\nThe operator will be removed next year when Pony.ai, whose investors include Toyota Motor Corp., sends out its driverless vehicles in some areas of California. Still, an operator will supervise vehicles from a distance and give help when the vehicles run into trouble, Peng said.\n\nCruise is majority-owned by General Motors. It started operating five driverless vehicles in San Francisco at night in October 2020. A human was in the front seat. The person has ""the ability to stop the vehicle at any point during the ride,"" a Cruise spokesman told Reuters.\n\n""Cruise views the development of self-driving vehicles as not only a tech race, but also a trust race,\xe2\x80\x9d the spokesman said. He added that humans help with safe driverless vehicle development and help ""build trust with the public.""\n\nIn the face of many technical and legal difficulties, some self-driving companies are accepting the need for human minders. The goal is to make money in the near future, investors and startup executives say.\n\nTesla Inc. recently launched a new test version of what it calls \xe2\x80\x9cFull Self-Driving"" software.

"492.txt";"b'Last summer, I asked (with a hint of frustration) where my totally self-driving car was. After all, it was 2020, and I had accumulated a slew of statements from years past that promised millions of them would be on the road by then.\n\nNow, we\xe2\x80\x99re well into 2021, and I\xe2\x80\x99m starting to get discouraged.\n\nFirst, Christopher Mims of The Wall Street Journal reported a few weeks ago that some experts now say, despite an accumulated investment of more than $80 billion toward research and technology, that \xe2\x80\x9cwe may never get the self-driving cars we were promised.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThen, I spoke to an expert I\xe2\x80\x99ve known for years, who told me basically the same thing.\n\nActually, that\xe2\x80\x99s not entirely true. Francesco Biondi did tell me we might see such a car, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I think it will probably be toward the end of my lifetime.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe is 33. I don\xe2\x80\x99t stand a chance.\n\nAll those dreams I had of a car that would take me to doctor appointments in my old age, drop me off at the door, park itself, then come get me when I was done? Poof! Up in smoke, like so many semi-autonomous cars that run into things.\n\nBiondi used to be an assistant professor at the University of Utah, where he conducted tests on volunteers who drove back and forth to Wendover in semi-autonomous cars. They drove one way manually and let the car handle much of the driving in the other direction. They wore contraptions that measured brain waves and had video recorders trained on them, which eventually demonstrated that people tend to lose focus when their cars automatically stay in their lanes and brake for traffic ahead.\n\nWhich is a problem, because those cars aren\xe2\x80\x99t really ready to drive themselves.\n\nIn other words, it\xe2\x80\x99s more dangerous to drive today\xe2\x80\x99s semi-autonomous cars than to pilot that old, dusty beater that requires you to do everything \xe2\x80\x94 brake, accelerate, turn, switch on the radio and watch out for the other guy \xe2\x80\x94 all by yourself.\n\nIf your beater has a manual transmission, you don\xe2\x80\x99t even have a hand free to text while driving.\n\nRelated Legislature approves bill allowing driverless cars on Utah roads\n\nToday, Biondi is a fully tenured assistant professor at the University of Windsor, in Canada. His window lets him look across the river toward Detroit, which once was the symbol of America\xe2\x80\x99s booming automobile industry. He\xe2\x80\x99s still very much involved in similar research.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think that the industry assumed it would be much easier,\xe2\x80\x9d he said about self-driving cars. The reason they were wrong is something that ought to make all of us feel proud:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs much as we like to think that humans are not as smart as machines \xe2\x80\xa6 that\xe2\x80\x99s far from being the case. Even after years of testing, autonomous cars are unable to match the human driver\xe2\x80\x99s performances. There are a lot of scenarios \xe2\x80\x94 weather conditions, road conditions \xe2\x80\x94 where these cars are not as smart as we want them to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSo, rogue machines aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to take over the world any time soon. That\xe2\x80\x99s good news, even though it won\xe2\x80\x99t help me get to the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s office as an old man.\n\nAnd yet that message doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be widespread knowledge. At least, that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the case last April in Texas when two men decided to go for a ride in a Tesla, with one apparently in the back seat and the other in the front passenger seat \xe2\x80\x94 and no one behind the wheel.\n\nThe New York Times said their wives overheard the men talking about the car\xe2\x80\x99s autopilot features as they left. They died when the car left the road on a steep turn.\n\nBiondi said evidence shows many people who buy semi-autonomous cars overestimate what they can do. Dealerships sometimes oversell the products or leave out information about limitations.\n\nMims, of The Wall Street Journal, suggests some experts think the whole idea needs to be rethought. They want to approach the necessary artificial intelligence by building systems that learn the way human babies do. Others want to divide the problem into smaller chunks, developing systems that each handle a piece of the puzzle.\n\nBiondi said he thinks commercial trucking shows more promise at the moment, especially if it involves dedicating lanes of traffic for that use only.\n\nTo me, it all sounds long and laborious and so \xe2\x80\xa6 well \xe2\x80\xa6 20th century.\n\nIt also sounds like I\xe2\x80\x99d better be prepared for that day when, as with my Dad and those before him, the kids discreetly take my keys from me and, in my decrepit state, I have to bum a ride to the doctor. What a bother.\n\nJay Evensen is a senior columnist for Deseret News.'";"Autonomous Cars";"492.txt-Autonomous Cars"
"493.txt";"b'The most remarkable thing about a ride in a robot car is how unremarkable it is.\n\nIt is definitely eerie to see the steering wheel turn by itself, the car brake and change lanes without human intervention. But just as with cruise control, it soon feels commonplace.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been covering autonomous driving for several years so I\xe2\x80\x99ve taken lots of these rides \xe2\x80\x94 often carefully choreographed to show the cars to best advantage.\n\nFive years ago, I perched nervously in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat of a self-driving Uber Ford Fusion in Pittsburgh, ready to take the wheel as it crisscrossed the city\xe2\x80\x99s notorious bridges. I chugged around the campus of Santa Clara University in a converted golf cart from Auro Robotics, and barreled down Interstate 280 in a self-driving big rig from Otto. Alongside Zoox co-founder Jesse Levinson, who narrated the trip like a proud parent, I wound through narrow San Francisco streets in 2018. Scientists at Stanford University, UC Berkeley and Nissan Research Center told me how they are facilitating communication between robot cars and humans.\n\nWednesday\xe2\x80\x99s jaunt in Waymo\xe2\x80\x99s self-driving Jaguar I-Pace had no surprises. The car smoothly glided to a stop at intersections and signaled before turns. The closest thing to a hiccup was a slight jerkiness when it pulled over to drop off us faux ride-hailing passengers. The company confined our 20-minute test drive to the wide, relatively empty streets of the Sunset District, avoiding the hills and traffic elsewhere in the city, so the car didn\xe2\x80\x99t face any challenges. Ever Guardado, our safety driver, never needed to assume control, but did so once at my request just to demonstrate the tones the car sounds when a driver takes over.\n\nFour years ago when I rode in an earlier-generation Waymo robot car at its testing site on a former military base in Merced County, Waymo staged several complex situations: a bicyclist pedaling alongside, a pedestrian wandering into the crosswalk, a car abruptly cutting off the robot car and boxes sprawling into the road. That robot car, which did not have a person behind the wheel, adapted quickly to all the tests thrown at it.\n\nWaymo, an arm of Google parent Alphabet, now has the distinction of running San Francisco\xe2\x80\x99s first robot taxi service for the public, albeit with backup drivers behind the wheel and limits on how many folks it will accept into its testing program.\n\nJessica Christian/The Chronicle\n\nFleets of robot taxis are how Waymo, Cruise, Zoox and other main contenders in the self-driving race hope to eventually recoup their investors\xe2\x80\x99 multibillion-dollar investments.\n\nWhy test robot taxis in San Francisco?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a major ride-hailing market with a lot of demand from residents,\xe2\x80\x9d said spokesperson Julianne McGoldrick. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the toughest environments for driving \xe2\x80\x94 weather, traffic, road grade, cyclists.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn other words, if a robot car can make it here, it can make it anywhere. That\xe2\x80\x99s also the philosophy of several of Waymo\xe2\x80\x99s competitors, notably GM spin-off Cruise, whose white Chevy Bolts are a common sight on city streets.\n\nWaymo is far along on robot taxis in Phoenix, a much easier city to navigate. It\xe2\x80\x99s given rides to selected testers since 2017, jettisoned the backup drivers since 2019 and now, for almost a year, has been giving hundreds of fully autonomous paid rides \xe2\x80\x94 sans backup driver \xe2\x80\x94 every week to any member of the public who summons one via the Waymo One app, which works pretty much like any other ride-hailing app.\n\nEven when there\xe2\x80\x99s no driver in the car, Waymo has operations specialists who monitor the rides via cameras on the dashboard and the back seat. At a ride\xe2\x80\x99s onset, they check that passengers are buckled up and haven\xe2\x80\x99t brought more than three people along. Riders can talk to them by pressing a button on the app or on a console in the back seat.\n\nJessica Christian/The Chronicle\n\nFor now San Francisco rides are free \xe2\x80\x94 Waymo doesn\xe2\x80\x99t yet have permission to charge a fee. And although it\xe2\x80\x99s had permission since 2018 to ditch backup drivers in California, it has not yet done so. Rival Cruise has been testing some cars without backup drivers in San Francisco for nine months.\n\nBut McGoldrick said its trajectory here to fully autonomous paid rides will be quicker than that in Phoenix.\n\nBack in 2016, lots of smart people said fully autonomous cars would be ubiquitous by 2020. AI researchers told me that their then-toddler-aged kids would never get driver\xe2\x80\x99s licenses.\n\nBut the prospect of robot cars \xe2\x80\x94 and the promise that they\xe2\x80\x99ll improve transportation, end traffic fatalities and reduce congestion \xe2\x80\x94 has stayed tantalizingly out of reach.\n\nAir Quality Tracker Check levels down to the neighborhood Ratings for the Bay Area and California, updated every 10 minutes\n\nThe technology got very far along \xe2\x80\x94 but not all the way. The public got disenchanted, especially after an Uber self-driving car struck and killed a pedestrian in 2018. Companies like Uber and Lyft sold off their self-driving units as the industry consolidated.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe low-hanging fruit in this field is some combination of slow speeds, simple environments and semi-supervised operations,\xe2\x80\x9d Bryant Walker Smith, a longtime industry observer and affiliate scholar at the Stanford Law School Center for Internet and Society, said in an email. \xe2\x80\x9cWaymo and Cruise have long been more interested in moon shots.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJessica Christian/The Chronicle\n\nThose companies need to find \xe2\x80\x9csweet spots that are both technically and financially feasible,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, noting that while Phoenix is technically much easier than the Bay Area, it\xe2\x80\x99s also much less lucrative.\n\nCurrent ride-hailing has low expenses, he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAn Uber trip is basically just a poorly paid driver in a midtier car.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut the robot car fleets, even though they eliminated the labor expenses, have to cover costs for cars that mount up to several hundred thousand dollars each, \xe2\x80\x9cas well as a vast infrastructure for remote human monitoring and support.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTV and movies are replete with far-out images of the future. But I was most struck by a low-tech image in the comedy-drama series \xe2\x80\x9cCasual.\xe2\x80\x9d The final season, which aired in 2018, purportedly took place a couple of years in the future. How the show signaled that: Lead actress Michaela Watkins arrived at her home in a ride-hailing vehicle. The camera briefly panned to show that no one was in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat.\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of naturally interwoven use of robot cars that futurists \xe2\x80\x94 and Waymo, Cruise, etc. \xe2\x80\x94 are betting on.\n\nCarolyn Said is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

You\xe2\x80\x99ll make the right adjustments in braking and accelerating, picking just the right moment to go in and out of your lane, all while carrying on a conversation with your passenger.\n\nGenerally, human drivers do relatively well with this kind of complexity. We\xe2\x80\x99re able to respond to the out-of-the-ordinary intuitively.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOn the other hand, we get bored, tired, and easily distracted. Even with all the improvements in automotive safety over the years and depressed vehicle miles traveled from the COVID-19 pandemic, an estimated 38,000 Americans died on the roads in 2020.\n\nAutonomous vehicles have long been promised as the solution, with their sensors that see far ahead in all kinds of weather and their ever-vigilant computers that follow the rules of the road with hyper focus.\n\nBut the reality is more complex. As often happens with new technologies, some challenges are harder than they seemed at first. In fact, the industry is going through a bit of a reset, with companies like Uber and Lyft selling their autonomous vehicle units.\n\nWhy is autonomy hard? The roadways are highly cluttered with many sizes and shapes of obstacles; various objects move in and out quickly and unpredictably; and human behavior is difficult for a machine to predict. Whenever people \xe2\x80\x9cact naturally\xe2\x80\x9d during an odd scenario, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good time to worry about autonomous vehicles.\n\nFor a long time, the answer appeared to be to let an autonomous vehicle do the bulk of the driving, but only with a human behind the wheel, ready to take over in case of failure. The best of both worlds, right?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nUnfortunately, no.\n\nResearch has shown that humans make poor safety drivers. By the time they gain situational awareness in an emergency, it\xe2\x80\x99s often too late to react. In fact, relying upon \xe2\x80\x9chuman fallback\xe2\x80\x9d might actually be more dangerous than fully automated systems.\n\nFurther, the approach of using virtual simulations to prove system safety is facing a harsh reality: The endlessly complex environment, coupled with constantly evolving hardware and software, means that relying upon systems to drive millions of simulated miles, while necessary, is insufficient.\n\nSo, the promise of widely deployed self-driving vehicles remains elusive.\n\nWe still think it\xe2\x80\x99s likely that highly automated vehicles, in some form and performing certain tasks, will become a reality. Where we first see these systems on the roads is uncertain: Maybe electric vehicles \xe2\x80\x94 cheaper to produce than complex gas vehicles \xe2\x80\x94 will include expensive autonomous systems; or maybe autonomous freight trucks on highways may have the right economic incentives for autonomy adoption.\n\nRegardless of which operational model succeeds, we believe there are four major steps we can take in the short term:\n\nLet autonomous vehicles communicate with one another through connected vehicle technology \xe2\x80\x94 The world is a complex place for autonomous vehicles. Weather makes it hard to virtually \xe2\x80\x9csee\xe2\x80\x9d with sensors; emergency responders alter the roadways to make accident scenes safe; and people around the vehicle are hidden by buildings and foliage. Any technology that simplifies this world is crucial to fast and safe adoption of these capabilities. Connected vehicle technology lets these systems \xe2\x80\x9ctalk\xe2\x80\x9d with each other and with the world around them, sharing information about traffic, objects, and intended vehicle paths. To make this vision a reality, industry and the government must come together to implement and standardize these communications, as well as invest in necessary infrastructure.\n\nThe world is a complex place for autonomous vehicles.

"495.txt";"b""Self-driving cars are being developed by several major technology companies and carmakers. credit: VCG/Getty\n\nWhen a driver slams on the brakes to avoid hitting a pedestrian crossing the road illegally, she is making a moral decision that shifts risk from the pedestrian to the people in the car. Self-driving cars might soon have to make such ethical judgments on their own \xe2\x80\x94 but settling on a universal moral code for the vehicles could be a thorny task, suggests a survey of 2.3 million people from around the world.\n\nThe largest ever survey of machine ethics1, published today in Nature, finds that many of the moral principles that guide a driver\xe2\x80\x99s decisions vary by country. For example, in a scenario in which some combination of pedestrians and passengers will die in a collision, people from relatively prosperous countries with strong institutions were less likely to spare a pedestrian who stepped into traffic illegally.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople who think about machine ethics make it sound like you can come up with a perfect set of rules for robots, and what we show here with data is that there are no universal rules,\xe2\x80\x9d says Iyad Rahwan, a computer scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge and a co-author of the study.\n\nThe survey, called the Moral Machine, laid out 13 scenarios in which someone\xe2\x80\x99s death was inevitable. Respondents were asked to choose who to spare in situations that involved a mix of variables: young or old, rich or poor, more people or fewer.\n\nPeople rarely encounter such stark moral dilemmas, and some critics question whether the scenarios posed in the quiz are relevant to the ethical and practical questions surrounding driverless cars. But the study\xe2\x80\x99s authors say that the scenarios stand in for the subtle moral decisions that drivers make every day. They argue that the findings reveal cultural nuances that governments and makers of self-driving cars must take into account if they want the vehicles to gain public acceptance.\n\nAt least one company working on self-driving cars \xe2\x80\x94 the German carmaker Audi \xe2\x80\x94 says that the survey could help prompt an important discussion about these issues. (Other firms with autonomous-vehicle programmes, including auto manufacturer Toyota and technology companies Waymo and Uber, declined to comment on the findings.) And Nicholas Christakis, a social scientist at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, is fascinated by the results.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a remarkable paper,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. The debate about whether ethics are universal or vary between cultures is an old one, says Christakis, and now the \xe2\x80\x9ctwenty-first century problem\xe2\x80\x9d of how to programme self-driving cars has reinvigorated it.\n\nThe road not taken\n\nSome of the world\xe2\x80\x99s biggest tech companies \xe2\x80\x94 including Google's parent, Alphabet; Uber; and Tesla \xe2\x80\x94 and carmakers now have self-driving car programmes. Many of these companies argue that the vehicles could improve road safety, ease traffic and improve fuel efficiency. Social scientists say the cars raise ethical issues, and could have unintended consequences for public safety and the environment.\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nIn 2016, Rahwan\xe2\x80\x99s team stumbled on an ethical paradox about self-driving cars2: in surveys, people said that they wanted an autonomous vehicle to protect pedestrians even if it meant sacrificing its passengers \xe2\x80\x94 but also that they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t buy self-driving vehicles programmed to act this way.\n\nCurious to see if the prospect of self-driving cars might raise other ethical condundrums, Rahwan gathered an international team of psychologists, anthropologists and economists to create the Moral Machine. Within 18 months, the online quiz had recorded 40 million decisions made by people from 233 countries and territories.\n\nNo matter their age, gender or country of residence, most people spared humans over pets, and groups of people over individuals. These responses are in line with rules proposed in what may be the only governmental guidance on self-driving cars: a 2017 report by the German Ethics Commission on Automated and Connected Driving.\n\nBut agreement ends there. When the authors analysed answers from people in the 130 countries with at least 100 respondents, they found that the nations could be divided into three groups. One contains North America and several European nations where Christianity has historically been the dominant religion; another includes countries such as Japan, Indonesia and Pakistan, with strong Confucian or Islamic traditions. A third group consists of Central and South America, as well as France and former French colonies. The first group showed a stronger preference for sacrificing older lives to save younger ones than did the second group, for example.\n\nThe researchers also identified correlations between social and economic factors in a country and the average opinions of its residents. The team found that people from countries with strong government institutions, such as Finland and Japan, more often chose to hit people who were crossing the road illegally than did respondents in nations with weaker institutions, such as Nigeria or Pakistan.\n\nScenarios that forced survey participants to choose whether to save a homeless person on one side of the road or an executive on the other revealed another point of departure: the choices people made often correlated with the level of economic inequality in their culture. People from Finland \xe2\x80\x94 which has a relatively small gap between the rich and the poor \xe2\x80\x94 showed little preference for swerving one way or the other. But the average respondent from Colombia \xe2\x80\x94 a country with significant economic disparity \xe2\x80\x94 chose to kill the lower-status person.\n\nAzim Shariff, a psychologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, finds this result interesting because it suggests that the survey really does reveal people\xe2\x80\x99s moral preferences. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you assume that places that have a lower level of income inequality have political policies that favor egalitarianism, this shows that the moral norms that support those policies are expressed in the way that people play these games.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPotholes ahead?\n\nAlthough autonomous vehicles aren't yet for sale to the public, test versions are cruising through several US cities. By 2021, at least five manufacturers hope to have self-driving cars and trucks in wide use.\n\nBryant Walker Smith, a law professor at the University of South Carolina in Columbia, is sceptical that the Moral Machine survey will have any practical use. He says that the study is unrealistic because there are few instances in real life in which a vehicle would face a choice between striking two different types of people. \xe2\x80\x9cI might as well worry about how automated cars will deal with asteroid strikes,\xe2\x80\x9d Walker Smith says.\n\nBut the study\xe2\x80\x99s authors say that their scenarios represent the minor moral judgements that human drivers make routinely \xe2\x80\x94 which can sometimes be fatal. A driver who veers away from cyclists riding on a curvy mountain road increases her chance of hitting an oncoming vehicle. If the number of driverless cars on the road increases, so too will the likelihood that they will be involved in such accidents.\n\nSome car companies are listening. Barbara Wege, who heads a group focused on autonomous-vehicle ethics at Audi in Ingolstadt, Germany, says such studies are valuable. Wege argues that self-driving cars would cause fewer accidents, proportionally, than human drivers do each year \xe2\x80\x94 but that events involving robots might receive more attention.\n\nSurveys such as the Moral Machine can help to begin public discussions about these inevitable accidents that might foster trust. \xe2\x80\x9cWe need to come up with a social consensus,\xe2\x80\x9d she says, \xe2\x80\x9cabout which risks we are willing to take.\xe2\x80\x9d""";"Autonomous Cars";"495.txt-Autonomous Cars"
"496.txt";"b""B Y THE AGE of seven months, most children have learned that objects still exist even when they are out of sight. Put a toy under a blanket and a child that old will know it is still there, and that he can reach underneath the blanket to get it back. This understanding, of \xe2\x80\x9cobject permanence\xe2\x80\x9d, is a normal developmental milestone, as well as a basic tenet of reality.\n\nListen to this story Your browser does not support the <audio> element. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.\n\nIt is also something that self-driving cars do not have. And that is a problem. Autonomous vehicles are getting better, but they still don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the world in the way that a human being does. For a self-driving car, a bicycle that is momentarily hidden by a passing van is a bicycle that has ceased to exist.\n\nThis failing is basic to the now-widespread computing discipline that has arrogated to itself the slightly misleading moniker of artificial intelligence ( AI ). Current AI works by building up complex statistical models of the world, but it lacks a deeper understanding of reality. How to give AI at least some semblance of that understanding\xe2\x80\x94the reasoning ability of a seven-month-old child, perhaps\xe2\x80\x94is now a matter of active research.\n\nModern AI is based on the idea of machine learning. If an engineer wants a computer to recognise a stop sign, he does not try to write thousands of lines of code that describe every pattern of pixels which could possibly indicate such a sign. Instead, he writes a program that can learn for itself, and then shows that program thousands of pictures of stop signs. Over many repetitions, the program gradually works out what features all of these pictures have in common.\n\nSimilar techniques are used to train self-driving cars to operate in traffic. Cars thus learn how to obey lane markings, avoid other vehicles, hit the brakes at a red light and so on. But they do not understand many things a human driver takes for granted\xe2\x80\x94that other cars on the road have engines and four wheels, or that they obey traffic regulations (usually) and the laws of physics (always). And they do not understand object permanence.\n\nIn a recent paper in Artificial Intelligence, Mehul Bhatt of Orebro University, in Sweden, who is also the founder of a firm called CoDesign Lab which is developing his ideas commercially, describes a different approach. He and his colleagues took some existing AI programs which are used by self-driving cars and bolted onto them a piece of software called a symbolic-reasoning engine.\n\nThe heart has its reasons...\n\nInstead of approaching the world probabilistically, as machine learning does, this software was programmed to apply basic physical concepts to the output of the programs that process signals from an autonomous vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s sensors. This modified output was then fed to the software which drives the vehicle. The concepts involved included the ideas that discrete objects continue to exist over time, that they have spatial relationships with one another\xe2\x80\x94such as \xe2\x80\x9cin-front-of\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbehind\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and that they can be fully or partly visible, or completely hidden by another object.\n\nAnd it worked. In tests, if one car momentarily blocked the sight of another, the reasoning-enhanced software could keep track of the blocked car, predict where and when it would reappear, and take steps to avoid it if necessary. The improvement was not huge. On standard tests Dr Bhatt\xe2\x80\x99s system scored about 5% better than existing software. But it proved the principle. And it also yielded something else. For, unlike a machine-learning algorithm, a reasoning engine can tell you the reason why it did what it did.\n\nYou could, for instance, ask a car fitted with a reasoning engine why it had hit the brakes, and it would be able to tell you that it thought a bicycle hidden by a van was about to enter the intersection ahead. A machine-learning program cannot do that. Besides helping improve program design, such information will, Dr Bhatt reckons, help regulators and insurance companies. It may thus speed up public acceptance of autonomous vehicles.\n\nDr Bhatt\xe2\x80\x99s work is part of a long-standing debate in the field of artificial intelligence. Early AI researchers, working in the 1950s, chalked up some successes using this sort of preprogrammed reasoning. But, beginning in the 1990s, machine learning improved dramatically, thanks to better programming techniques combined with more powerful computers and the availability of more data. Today almost all AI is based on it.\n\nDr Bhatt is not, though, alone in his scepticism. Gary Marcus, who studies psychology and neural science at New York University and is also the boss of an AI and robotics company called Robust. AI , agrees. To support his point of view, Dr Marcus cites a much-publicised result, albeit from eight years ago. This was when engineers at DeepMind (then an independent company, now part of Google) wrote a program that could learn, without being given any hints about the rules, how to play Breakout, a video game which involves hitting a moving virtual ball with a virtual paddle.\n\nDeepMind\xe2\x80\x99s program was a great player. But when another group of researchers tinkered with Breakout\xe2\x80\x99s code\xe2\x80\x94shifting the location of the paddles by just a few pixels\xe2\x80\x94its abilities plummeted. It was not able to generalise what it had learned from a specific situation even to a situation that was only slightly different.\n\nBack to the future\n\nFor Dr Marcus, this example highlights the fragility of machine-learning. But others think it is symbolic reasoning which is brittle, and that machine learning still has a lot of mileage left in it. Among them is Jeff Hawke, vice-president of technology at Wayve, a self-driving-car firm in London. Wayve\xe2\x80\x99s approach is to train the software elements running a car\xe2\x80\x99s various components simultaneously, rather than separately. In demonstrations, Wayve\xe2\x80\x99s cars make good decisions while navigating narrow, heavily trafficked London streets\xe2\x80\x94a task that challenges many humans.\n\nAs Dr Hawke puts it, \xe2\x80\x9cthe complexity of most real-world tasks is greater than is possible to solve with handcrafted rules, and it\xe2\x80\x99s well known that expert systems built with rules tend to struggle with complexity. This is true regardless of how well thought out or structured the formal logic is.\xe2\x80\x9d Such a system might, for instance, craft a rule that a car should stop at a red light. But lights are designed differently in different countries, and some are intended for pedestrians rather than cars. There are also situations in which you might need to jump a red light, such as to make way for a fire engine. \xe2\x80\x9cThe beauty of machine learning\xe2\x80\x9d, Dr Hawke says, \xe2\x80\x9cis that all these factors and concepts can be automatically uncovered and learned from data. And with more data, it continues to learn and become more intelligent.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNicholas Rhinehart, who studies robotics and AI at the University of California, Berkeley, also backs machine learning. He says Dr Bhatt\xe2\x80\x99s approach does indeed show you can combine the two approaches. But he is not sure it is necessary. In his work, and also that of others, machine-learning systems alone can already predict probabilities a few seconds into the future\xe2\x80\x94such as whether another car is likely to give way or not\xe2\x80\x94and make contingency plans based on those predictions.\n\nDr Bhatt responds that you can train a car with data accumulated over millions of kilometres of driving, and still not be sure you have covered all the necessary situations. In many cases, it might be simpler and more effective to program some of the rules in from the start.\n\nFor champions of both strategies, the question goes beyond self-driving cars to the future of AI itself. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think we're taking the right approach right now,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr Marcus says. \xe2\x80\x9c[Machine learning] has proven useful for some things like speech recognition, but it's not actually the answer to AI . We haven\xe2\x80\x99t really solved the intelligence problem.\xe2\x80\x9d One way or another, then, it seems seven-month-olds still have a lot to teach machines. \xe2\x96\xa0\n\nAn early version of this article was published online on September 1st 2021""";"Autonomous Cars";"496.txt-Autonomous Cars"
"497.txt";"b'National Security Implications of Leadership in Autonomous Vehicles\n\nJune 28, 2021\n\nDigital technologies have created a transitional moment for societies. High-speed connectivity, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI) are ubiquitous (even if not always visible) and are reshaping economies by creating new opportunities. This follows a pattern set centuries ago. Automation of basic tasks began in the eighteenth century and accelerated rapidly at the end of the nineteenth century, with a new wave of automation now well underway. Autonomous systems already create value across global markets by lowering costs and improving services. The ability to combine better sensors, more powerful computer processing, and faster connectivity expands the productivity of human labor, creates new services, and automates existing ones.\n\nOne of the most important parts of the next wave of automation is transportation, specifically the appearance of self-driving, or \xe2\x80\x9cautonomous,\xe2\x80\x9d vehicles (AVs). Self-driving cars offer immense gains in productivity and safety. The technologies developed for self-driving cars have broad commercial (and potentially military) implications. A self-driving car is a vehicle capable of navigating without a driver actively operating or monitoring it. Self-driving cars are a kind of specialized robot\xe2\x80\x94not the humanoid robot common to popular culture, but self-operating devices that provide a commercially valuable service and automate routine tasks.\n\nThe impact of autonomous systems on the auto industry will be significant, as the technology behind AVs will reshape transportation and urban life as profoundly as the move from horses to cars. AVs are already a leadingsector for private AI investment, reflecting the market\xe2\x80\x99s estimate of their future importance.\n\nAutomation and the larger digital transformation create major challenges for national security, and the implications of AVs on national security deserve further attention. In addition to new opportunities, widespread deployment of AVs can also create new risks and vulnerabilities, particularly when considered in the context of tech competition between the United States and China.\n\nNational security can be defined as the condition where people can choose how they are governed and live in a world guided by the rule of law. To attain this requires an ability to defend the national interest and, increasingly, an ability to create and use technology in ways that support national security for both the near and long term. Technological leadership used to be seen as important for a few sectors, but its importance has spread across the entire economy. Innovation and the adoption of new technologies are the keys to the long-term growth needed for national security. This is particularly true for automobiles. Cars are now high-tech devices. Vehicles are built around semiconductors and software more than precisely engineered metal parts. The ability to build the cars of the future will be a good indicator of a country\xe2\x80\x99s technological strength and abilities.\n\nThe Military Applications of Autonomous Vehicles\n\nAs much of the innovation and work on AVs is now happening in the private sector, it is reasonable to ask how much carryover there will be from commercial to military uses. In the early stages of developing AV technology, there was considerable overlap. As development progressed, there has been divergence, and the direct application of commercial autonomy will be smaller (the same way a combat aircraft and a passenger aircraft that share certain technologies can jointly benefit from research and development but are ultimately designed for fundamentally different purposes and requirements).\n\nAutonomous devices that operate without human control are deeply attractive to militaries and are already deployed in aerospace and undersea vehicles by leading military powers. Autonomous ground vehicles are more challenging to develop, given the much more complex and varied terrain in which operations take place, but innovation in the commercial self-driving sector could improve military vehicles\xe2\x80\x99 operations. This will be seen first in logistics and support vehicles (e.g., autonomous trucks), where the transition from commercial to military is simpler, and perhaps later in combat vehicles.\n\nIt is not an accident that the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) was the government agency that began work on autonomous driving in 1984 with its Autonomous Land Vehicle program. DARPA then sponsored the earliest AV test in its Grand Challenges, which sought to accelerate the development of AV technologies by holding a race among prototypes for a cash prize. No one completed the first Grand Challenge in 2004. The second iteration, held in a desert area in 2005, was won by a university team which completed the 132-mile course in seven hours. DARPA held a third Grand Challenge two years later in a simulated urban environment, which was also won by another university team. These DARPA efforts, established in response to a 2001 National Defense Authorization Act mandate, jump-started the research into autonomous driving.\n\nBut the current geopolitical contest that threatens U.S. security is not a traditional military competition. It is a new kind of contest that underscores the importance of innovation capabilities and technology leadership. This means that having a strong AV sector, even if not directly applied to military use, is essential for national security. While there may be \xe2\x80\x9cspillover\xe2\x80\x9d effects from technology developed for commercial vehicles for military equipment, the primary contribution will be in strengthening digital industries. That is what will improve national economic performance and help reduce supply chain and espionage concerns. The importance of commercial development has grown. Since the end of the Cold War, advanced technologies have frequently originated in the private sector. The countries that will do best in economics and security will be those that have a strong private-sector tech base from which they can draw upon commercial technological developments.\n\nThe current geopolitical contest that threatens U.S. security is not a traditional military competition. . . . having a strong AV sector, even if not directly applied to military use, is essential for national security.\n\nThe main contribution of AVs to national security, however, does not come from self-driving tanks, but from the importance of the automotive sector to the nation. The automotive industry contributes 3.5 percent of U.S. GDP, making it one of the most important areas of industrial activity (as a comparison, the space and aerospace sector\xe2\x80\x99s share is 4 percent). The development of autonomous and electric vehicles involves the ability to develop and deploy a broad range of important emerging technologies, such as AI, autonomy, and electric propulsion and batteries, and will drive progress in innovation in ways that shape many sectors. Even though the vast majority of the vehicle market is commercial and civilian, when looking at the value of economic strength to national security, AVs are a critical sector for overall national security.\n\nAV Development in the Context of Tech Competition\n\nThe digital transition comes at a moment of significant geopolitical competition. The nature of global competition has changed and is increasingly a battle over technology and economic growth. The national capability to design, build, and innovate in technology will be crucial in this contest.\n\nTechnology creates new kinds of competition and conflict. Leadership in innovation and technology is central to global influence, prestige, and power. AVs are at the cutting edge of technology and are crucial to future U.S. strength. The United States has learned the hard way\xe2\x80\x94in the case of telecom infrastructure manufacturing and Huawei\xe2\x80\x99s extensive deployment and reach\xe2\x80\x94that it is not in the United States\xe2\x80\x99 interest to lose a strategic industry or to find itself dependent on an adversarial foreign power for key technologies. While there is minimal risk that the dynamic automotive sector in the United States would disappear like Nortel or Lucent, keeping this sector strong is essential for the national interest and national security. Automobiles are not an industry the United States can afford to lose any more than it would want to lose its aerospace industry.\n\nDeploying fully autonomous cars is an immense technological challenge, requiring advances in computing, sensors, and networking. The first step has been the deployment of assisted driving systems, which are now relatively common in newer cars. Full autonomy is several levels beyond this and in various stages of testing by several companies. This involves further advances in sensors and processing. The work to meet these challenges will deepen the U.S. technological base and, by commercializing research, strengthen it. Companies will also need a supportive regulatory environment to be able to deploy AVs at commercial scale. For the United States, a strong technology base and supportive regulatory environment is crucial for national security and for maintaining its global influence and economic strength.\n\nThe ability to apply new technologies to commercial and security matters is as important as the ability to create them. Nations that have the companies and skills to develop AI and apply it to economic activities will be stronger and more secure. It is not surprising then that more and more countries are developing their own AI strategies, highlighting their importance for growth and safety. Sixty countries have already collectively issued over 600 AI policy initiatives, including governance efforts and financial support for the sector. These policies will also help make the implementers more influential in the global arena, where global perceptions of tech leadership and economic performance provide substantial political benefit. This has been a core part of the United States\xe2\x80\x99 international strength since landing on the moon in the late 1960s and is one reason why the competition with China creates such serious concerns.\n\nFor the United States, a strong technology base and supportive regulatory environment is crucial for national security and for maintaining its global influence and economic strength.\n\nAdopting new technologies is the best path to creating wealth for countries such as the United States and the best way to increase productivity (which has been a problem for the United States and others, including China). AVs\xe2\x80\x99 most important contribution to national security may come from increasing the United States\xe2\x80\x99 productivity and wealth as part of the larger AI and robotics revolution.\n\nThe United States and China\n\nThere is a clear competition between the United States and China, and a major part of this competition is over leadership in technology. Both sides recognize the economic and security returns of technological leadership, and China has sought technological independence from the West for more than a century. The longer-term contest between the two is over how the world will be structured, and technological leadership is increasingly a determinant of national power.\n\nChina has a very different view of how societies should be governed, how international relations should be structured, and what its place should be among great powers. China is making a concerted and public effort to obtain superiority and to dominate key markets. The MIC2025 plan exemplifies the focus and importance of the technology sector. There are long-standing plans in China (albeit with mixed results) for a massive expansion of its technological capability. There is now a growing realization in the United States that it needs to respond to this, embodied in proposed legislation such as the Endless Frontier Act.\n\nThe desire in China to develop indigenous technological capabilities equivalent to the West dates back to the nineteenth century when European industrialization and its consequences displaced China from what it sees as its rightful place. China\xe2\x80\x99s lack of advanced technologies allowed troubling European interventions in China\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign affairs and began what the Chinese refer to as the \xe2\x80\x9cCentury of Humiliation,\xe2\x80\x9d where the once-great power lost sovereign control to imperialist states in Europe. Almost two centuries later, after surpassing Europe economically, China believes it has reached a moment when it can return to the center of global power. The obstacle to this return is the United States.\n\nThere are many questions about this Chinese narrative of resurgence under the Chinese Communist Party\xe2\x80\x99s (CCP) rule, but it meets compelling domestic political needs. The CCP\xe2\x80\x99s claim to unchallenged rule is buttressed by powerful nationalist sentiments, long present in China as a reaction to the West and now exploited by the CCP. China\xe2\x80\x99s president Xi Jinping has been clear in his views that the West is in decline and that a new world order should be centered on China. China\xe2\x80\x99s rise has been propelled by a number of factors, including heavy state investment in technology, but also by illicit measures, including a disregard for its World Trade Organization (WTO) commitments on the treatment of foreign companies, intellectual property (IP) theft, and a massive industrial espionage campaign targeting Western technology. China feels justified in these actions because of the Century of Humiliation and an artificial narrative about how the United States also relies on similar measures.\n\nChina\xe2\x80\x99s goals are to ensure that its economic development and modernization continues, to end reliance on foreign technologies, and to build a technology base strong enough to produce high-tech weaponry and commercial products that, when combined with subsidies, can displace foreign competitors. China uses a hybrid state/market model. \xe2\x80\x9cMilitary-Civil Fusion\xe2\x80\x9d moves China\xe2\x80\x99s economy much closer to a wartime footing, with a deep integration of the civilian and defense technological systems. Except in a few key areas, China\xe2\x80\x99s innovation system remains weaker than that of the United States. Self-driving cars, however, are an area where there are several competitive Chinese firms and Chinese technology is strong. China\xe2\x80\x99s government seeks to replace the United States in technological leadership and utilize technologies such as AVs to boost its military and economic competitiveness.\n\nThe 2021 annual threat assessment by the U.S. intelligence community addressed the risks to the United States\xe2\x80\x99 national security from emerging technologies. The report concludes that China will maintain its policies to promote indigenous technological innovation, since Chinese leaders perceive these policies as the way to \xe2\x80\x9creduce the dependence on foreign technologies, enable military advances, and sustain economic growth and thus ensure the CCP\xe2\x80\x99s survival.\xe2\x80\x9d AVs and self-driving cars are part of this larger competition between the United States and China. They are also central to the competition over the development and use of AI. In all countries, this AI competition involves a blend of government funding and private actors driven in part or entirely by market incentives and government subsidies.\n\nChina already has a robust AV industry aimed at the commercial market. In early 2017, Qiushi (the official journal of the CCP) identified innovative military technologies, such as unmanned tanks and remote-controlled shop trucks, as a unique opportunity for China to exceed the United States in military power.\n\nBoth China and the United States have advantages and disadvantages in a contest that revolves around technology, research, and investment. The United States benefits from a robust entrepreneurial environment, a dynamic and risk-taking financial system, a strong research base, and an innovation community skilled at commercializing research. China also has an entrepreneurial private sector and a growing research sector, but the government\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to invest large amounts over many years in its technological base is its primary advantage over the United States.\n\nChinese behaviors have eroded the commercial and technological globalization of the last three decades and, more importantly, pose a real national security risk to the United States. A world where China sets the rules will find that the rules are used to meet the needs of the CCP. Privacy is nonexistent in China and will be nonexistent in a world China leads. China will use its political power to confer commercial advantage on its companies at the expense of foreign competitors. This sounds harsh, but it is a description of the CCP, not of China itself.\n\nToday, China has the world\xe2\x80\x99s second-largest economy, supported by state-directed investment, is conducting aggressive industrial espionage programs globally over the internet, and is exhibiting a continued unwillingness to observe trade obligations. Using a Chinese AV, with all its internet connections, could be as risky as using Chinese telecoms.\n\nAutonomous Vehicles Will Create New Cybersecurity Risks and Vulnerabilities\n\nCybercrime is a lucrative activity. It cost the global economy more than a trillion dollars in 2019, and the rate of increase in costs has accelerated since 2010. Cybercrime harms public safety, undermines national security, and damages economies. Ransomware, phishing schemes, and cryptocurrencies make it easier to succeed and monetize cybercrime and, when combined with the sanctuary offered by big countries, help explain the rapid increase. AVs, given their reliance on software, computing, and connectivity, could be a new vector for cybersecurity risks.\n\nCars have become rolling computers, loaded with cameras, microphones, and other sensors, all operated by complex software. Increasingly, modern cars connect to the internet and collect information on location, speed, and perhaps on driver communications (e.g., text, email, voice). This means that data from cars can be accessed remotely, with the owner\xe2\x80\x99s permission or perhaps without it. Manufacturers already use this information for safety, convenience, predictive maintenance, and increasingly for entertainment. Future cars will collect even more data.\n\nSome of that data can reference locations and geographical features. Cross-border data transmission can be problematic if sensitive information is being collected. A 2017 paper from the Chinese Academy of Telecommunication Research of China\xe2\x80\x99s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology addresses that collection of information and considers it a matter of national security if foreign cars are used in China.\n\nAnything that is connected to the internet is vulnerable. The hardware and software behind AVs create a range of opportunities to hackers, as does the need to integrate hardware and software. Many different systems interact in a self-driving car and provide opportunities for hacking to manipulate different systems, including navigation, entertainment, or connectivity with other cars and infrastructure. Given their reliance on continuous communication, another concern is external manipulation of AV systems. From manipulating indicators or attacking the camera system to read speed signs incorrectly, to tampering with road paint to misguide the vehicle, AVs contribute to a vulnerable threat environment.\n\nIn-vehicle and inter-vehicle communication systems are necessary for the safe operation of AVs. In similar ways to the vulnerabilities created by the Internet of Things (IoT), the \xe2\x80\x9cInternet of Vehicles\xe2\x80\x9d (IoV) creates new challenges for cybersecurity. Cars have become another device at the edge of the network where connectivity tempts attackers. Vehicles require not only that their systems be able to communicate with each other, but also connect with other AVs or infrastructure relying on a wireless network.\n\nAnything that is connected to the internet is vulnerable. The hardware and software behind AVs create a range of opportunities to hackers, as does the need to integrate hardware and software.\n\nSupply chains can be compromised from the start. If AVs come from an untrustworthy source or if there are supply chain risks, even the best cybersecurity will not have an impact in risk reduction. A vehicle could be 100 percent unhackable, but if the manufacturer has built-in access and collection or if the information collected by the vehicle is sent over the internet to a hostile country, it will circumvent any defense. There is no need for a back door when the manufacturer has the key to the front door.\n\nRecent events highlight the potential for cybersecurity risks with AVs. Ransomware attacks, where an individual car or a class of cars could be rendered inoperable until a ransom is paid, are possible. While these could be aimed at individual car owners, it is more likely that cybercriminals will go after fleet operations or car manufacturers as better-paying possibilities. While a strong domestic AV industry will not eliminate cybersecurity risk, it would be much more preferable than a supply and car industry located in a hostile competitor.\n\nEspionage and Autonomous Vehicles\n\nThe concerns regarding cybersecurity and data protection are not only important for user protection, but also in the context of national security and geopolitical competition with China. The trove of data collected by AVs, paired with cybersecurity vulnerabilities, creates an appealing target for intelligence collection. AVs will require thinking of cars in a new way when it comes to espionage risk.\n\nIt is unlikely that the governments of other major car producers\xe2\x80\x94Germany, Japan, and Korea\xe2\x80\x94will exploit this advantage. They have no political or security motive to do so. China is another matter, however. A 2020 survey of Chinese espionage by CSIS found 152 publicly reported instances of Chinese espionage directed at the United States since 2000. This did not include espionage against U.S. firms or persons located in China, nor did it include the more than 1,200 IP theft cases brought by U.S. companies against Chinese entities. U.S. officials have repeatedly stated that China\xe2\x80\x99s espionage efforts exceed in scope and scale what was seen in the Cold War. This is because global digital networks and technologies provide China with immense new opportunities for espionage.\n\nIn China, the 2017 National Intelligence Law permits the Chinese government to demand and receive information from Chinese companies and citizens. Article 14 reads that \xe2\x80\x9cstate intelligence work organs, when legally carrying forth intelligence work, may demand that concerned organs, organizations, or citizens provide needed support, assistance, and cooperation.\xe2\x80\x9d Legally carrying forth intelligence work means any action authorized by the CPP leadership, which keeps close control over China\xe2\x80\x99s intelligence agencies and activities.\n\nThis means that data on location, behavior, and potentially conversations from the operators of Chinese-made cars could be accessed by the government over the internet. China is the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest surveillance state, and Chinese network technologies provide the Chinese government with the tools for monitoring behavior and collecting information on residents in its territory\xe2\x80\x94early examples include \xe2\x80\x9cGolden Shield\xe2\x80\x9d (a massive communications surveillance program) and \xe2\x80\x9cGreen Dam\xe2\x80\x9d (a monitoring and censorship program required on laptops in China). China may have tipped its hand about intent when it banned Tesla vehicles from driving into military facilities and housing compounds for personnel working in sensitive industries and state agencies. (Tesla has attempted to placate the Chinese by promising to hold all Chinese data in China.) The features that allow the collection and exfiltration of data potentially make cars an ideal surveillance platform.\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nIf this contest did not involve an unscrupulous and adversarial foreign power, it would be a normal commercial competition among companies, governed by the rules that apply to trade and the protection of IP. Commercial competition shapes U.S., European, Korean, and Japanese auto companies, but the same is not always true for China, where the government can play a much more directive role. That difference is what makes the contest over AVs so important.\n\nThere is a strong research base in Europe, and a long heritage of skilled engineering, but they have had difficulty commercializing the results of research. This may be less of a handicap in self-driving cars, given the strength and central position of the German auto industry, as long as Europe has access to leading-edge AI research and microelectronics from European and non-European sources. The contest takes place in a complicated international political environment. The chief complication is with Europe. Simply put, Berlin is a major driver of European policy, and it is currently unwilling to push hard on China because it is an essential market for Germany\xe2\x80\x99s car industry\xe2\x80\x94even though the Germans fear that China\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate intent is to ransack their automotive technology and displace German carmakers. This could damage a major U.S. security and economic partner in ways that harm both its interests and those of the United States. Trends in European politics suggest this more relaxed approach to China may be changing as suspicions about China\xe2\x80\x99s economic and political power grow.\n\nThe United States has also begun to address the decades-long shortfall in public investment on research and technology. The United States is unused to being challenged and was not prepared for this challenge from China. It has relied on technology to provide a qualitative advantage over opponents since World War II, but the requirements for technological advantage have changed. In the past, technological superiority was produced by a superb scientific establishment, long-term federal support for research, and close links between the research and industrial communities. Both support and linkages atrophied in the last few decades. More importantly, technological innovation is now led by the private sector and oriented toward commercial markets. This is where qualitative advantage for national security will come from in the future.\n\nTechnological progress is cumulative and continuous, and the pace at which nations adopt new technologies will help to determine their security relative to others. The nation that \xe2\x80\x9cdominates\xe2\x80\x9d AI (to quote Russian president Vladimir Putin) will not be \xe2\x80\x9cthe ruler of the world,\xe2\x80\x9d but the nation that is best at creating and accommodating technological change will do better in economics and security than others. The ability to employ AI and autonomous systems to gain better performance, new digital services, and create wealth is at the core of the new international competition and an area where the United States must ensure that its policies and regulations keep it competitive. No nation will \xe2\x80\x9cdominate\xe2\x80\x9d AI or the AV market, but being a leader in autonomy is a vital U.S. interest and crucial for national security.\n\nJames Andrew Lewis is a senior vice president and director of the Strategic Technologies Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, D.C.\n\nThis report is made possible by support from Cruise LLC.\n\nThis report is produced by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a private, tax-exempt institution focusing on international public policy issues.

If the exact location of the surrounding objects is known, this technology can provide the absolute vehicle location with assistance from a high amount of map data. When integrated with complimentary technology such as: ultrasonic, inertial motion, digital maps, radar/LiDAR and cameras, GNSS acts as the sixth sense to deliver the positioning performance required by autonomous vehicles.\n\nMany technologies onboard vehicles provide local or relative localization. GNSS provides an absolute localization solution, and with the following technologies can achieve the accuracy and availability requirements of a full autonomous driving solution.\n\nSPAN\xc2\xae GNSS+INS Navigation\n\nWith the growing developments in automotive technology, the need for accurate, reliable and robust ground reference has emerged.

"56.txt";"b'An autonomous vehicle, or a driverless vehicle, is one that is able to operate itself and perform necessary functions without any human intervention, through ability to sense its surroundings.\n\nAn autonomous vehicle utilises a fully automated driving system in order to allow the vehicle to respond to external conditions that a human driver would manage.\n\nWhat are the 6 Levels of Autonomous Vehicles?\n\nThere are six different levels of automation and, as the levels increase, the extent of the driverless car\xe2\x80\x99s independence regarding operation control increases.\n\nAt level 0, the car has no control over its operation and the human driver does all of the driving.\n\nAt level 1, the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s ADAS (advanced driver assistance system) has the ability to support the driver with either steering or accelerating and braking.\n\nAt level 2, the ADAS can oversee steering and accelerating and braking in some conditions, although the human driver is required to continue paying complete attention to the driving environment throughout the journey, while also performing the remainder of the necessary tasks.\n\nAt level 3, the ADS (advanced driving system) can perform all parts of the driving task in some conditions, but the human driver is required to be able to regain control when requested to do so by the ADS. In the remaining conditions, the human driver executes the necessary tasks.\n\nAt level 4, the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s ADS is able to perform all driving tasks independently in certain conditions in which human attention is not required.\n\nFinally, level 5 involves full automation whereby the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s ADS is able to perform all tasks in all conditions, and no driving assistance is required from the human driver. This full automation will be enabled by the application of 5G technology, which will allow vehicles to communicate not just with one another, but also with traffic lights, signage and even the roads themselves.\n\nOne of the aspects of the vehicle technology used in automated vehicles is ACC, or adaptive cruise control. This system is able to adjust the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s speed automatically to ensure that it maintains a safe distance from the vehicles in front of it. This function relies on information obtained using sensors on the vehicle and allows the car to perform tasks such as brake when it senses that it is approaching any vehicles ahead. This information is then processed and the appropriate instructions are sent to actuators in the vehicle, which control the responsive actions of the car such as steering, acceleration and braking. Highly automated vehicles with fully automated speed control are able to respond to signals from traffic lights and other such non-vehicular activities.\n\nWhat are the Advantages?\n\nAutonomous vehicle technology may be able to provide certain advantages compared to human-driven vehicles. One such potential advantage is that they could provide increased safety on the road \xe2\x80\x93 vehicle crashes cause many deaths every year, and automated vehicles could potentially decrease the number of casualties as the software used in them is likely to make fewer errors in comparison to humans. A decrease in the number of accidents could also reduce traffic congestion, which is a further potential advantage posed by autonomous vehicles. Autonomous driving can also achieve this by the removal of human behaviours that cause blockages on the road, specifically stop-and-go traffic.\n\nAnother possible advantage of automated driving is that people who are not able to drive \xe2\x80\x93 due to factors like age and disabilities \xe2\x80\x93 could be able to use automated cars as more convenient transport systems.\n\nAdditional advantages that come with an autonomous car are elimination of driving fatigue and being able to sleep during overnight journeys.'";"Autonomous Cars";"56.txt-Autonomous Cars"

That\'s a dream scenario self-driving cars promise. Proponents say there would be no more crashes, no more drunk driving, no more traffic. It\'s tantalizing to think that cars will one day be able to drive us. It can also be terrifying to others who fear letting go of the wheel of control.\n\nSelf-driving cars are already here, in a sense. There are limited trials of vehicles running with no drivers along predetermined, hyper-limited routes in the U.S. and other countries, operated by their makers and technology companies. But the day when millions of self-driving cars ply the world\'s roads is still a long way out. But how far? We take a look at some of the most common questions surrounding self-driving cars and when you might no longer be behind the wheel.\n\nHow Much Does a Self-Driving Car Cost?\n\nAccording to former Waymo CEO John Krafcik, in an interview with German publication Manager Magazin, a Jaguar I-Pace equipped with Waymo\'s sensors and computers costs no more than a moderately equipped Mercedes-Benz S-Class. So likely in the $130,000-$150,000 ballpark. Of course, these costs will come down as the technologies used to power self-driving cars (cameras, radar systems, sensors, advanced automotive computers) drop as the costs to make them become more affordable at scale and they advance enough to be relied upon in all circumstances and conditions. Using Waymo\'s lidar as an example, its engineering team was able to build a version that costs 90 percent less than what used to be $75,000 a unit.\n\nSee all 3 photos See all 3 photos\n\nWhat Are These Automated Driving Levels I Keep Hearing About?\n\nThe Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) has classified six levels of automation. Level 0, Level 1, and Level 2 systems require a human to be actively driving and monitoring the vehicle and the driving environment at all times; think lane-keep assist or active cruise-control systems as seen on current vehicles. But Level 3, Level 4, and Level 5 are where automated systems start to take control and when ""self-driving"" enters the picture. Level 3 is in essence a bridge level where the system can drive the car for a period of time, but the driver must still be ready to re-engage with the system at a moment\'s notice. Level 4 and 5 are where the car essentially drives you, with Level 4 still having a few limited scenarios where the driver may need to take over. Level 5 means never having any control of the vehicle whatsoever.\n\nCan I Buy a Self-Driving Car Now?\n\nNo. No vehicles available for sale in the U.S. today are self-driving. Cars equipped with Tesla Autopilot, Ford BlueCruise, and GM SuperCruise are NOT self-driving. They may appear to be self-driving, given that you can drive without your hands on the steering wheel for a predetermined length of time, but they are not reliable or capable enough to be true self-driving. Those systems are classified as Level 2 capable, where the driver can briefly cede driving responsibilities but must be alert and always ready to take over. In effect, the driver is still in charge of the operation of the vehicle, no matter what the system is capable of performing.\n\nSee all 3 photos See all 3 photos\n\nWhen Can I Buy a Self-Driving Car in the Future?\n\nAt this point, self-driving cars are more of a future technology like what you might see in Black Mirror (a near future science fiction TV drama). The tech seems highly plausible, but we are not there yet in reality. We are at a point where we may see Level 3 self-driving cars in the next five years, but they would only work in very limited conditions. Chances are, you may be able to ride in a self-driving taxi without a driver before seeing a self-driving car for sale on a dealer lot. There are still many problems to tackle before Level 4 or 5 autonomous cars can become a real thing. In the meantime, companies will sell some intermediate products to fund their self-driving development. For example, Tesla\'s Full Self-Driving (FSD) system. In theory, a Tesla with FSD has the hardware to ""self-drive,"" but development is not there yet. What Tesla is selling now is a Level 2 driving assist system for real and self-driving as a promise.\n\nWhat Are the Advantages of Self-Driving Cars?\n\nSafety is a major benefit of self-driving cars. The prevailing wisdom is that self-driving systems will drastically reduce or even remove human error on the road, which will reduce crashes to virtually zero. Humans can get tired and distracted, something machines and algorithms will never be. Computers are also able to strictly follow rules and cooperate with one another, so along with a reduced number of crashes, self-driving cars can help smooth out traffic flow and reduce traffic jams. They can also solve the headache of looking for a parking spot by self-parking by themselves. For people who cannot drive (age, disability, or any other reason), automated vehicles can provide them with new personal mobility options.\n\nWhat are Disadvantages of Self-Driving Cars?\n\nIn today\'s stage, the self-drive working condition is very limited. Honda\'s Traffic Jam Pilot can only self-drive under 30 mph (Audi\'s under 37 mph), and Level 4 Waymo vehicles can only operate within a confined zone when weather permits. High cost will also remain a disadvantage until the technology becomes mainstream. Then there\'s the question of how infallible all of the computing power and technology necessary to power self-driving cars will be. Personal computers freeze all the time. What happens when a car\'s computer brain freezes?\n\nCan You Sleep in a Self-Driving Car?\n\nIn a true Level 4 or 5 automated vehicle, yes, you could sleep, but at that point, you\'re basically a passenger, much like riding in a taxi. But in a Level 3 car you\'ll need to remain awake because whenever self-driving conditions are not met, the system needs a human driver to take control. And NO, DO NOT sleep in a Tesla on Autopilot. It is not a self-driving car, even if you bought the Full Self-Driving option.\n\nWhat Technologies Are Essential for Self-Driving Cars?\n\nDriving is a complicated task, so there are many technologies involved. To name a few: ultra-high-resolution cameras with high-dynamic-range sensors to see in various light conditions, ultrasonic sensors to detect objects around the car, light-emitting radar (lidar) to detect faraway objects, ultra-fast computer chips to process the large influx of data pouring in by the millisecond (not to mention storage of said data), and sophisticated software to do the driving. You also need high-speed internet connections to move data to and from the car, to and from other cars, and to and from any infrastructure. One major tech development that will help speed up self-driving car development is machine learning. It contributes to a boost in developing greater image recognition and driving algorithms.\n\nWhat Is Machine Learning for Cars?'";"Autonomous Cars";"6.txt-Autonomous Cars"
"60.txt";"b'Commuting time might even be dramatically reduced if different activities could be done virtually from home. Further to this, what will actually be transported in self-driving vehicles is another interesting question. With a steep expansion in ecommerce, the flow of goods in cities is suited to smaller vehicles. The traditional logistic systems will be challenged by this development, and self-driving vehicles might be used to transport goods when not transporting people. Therefore self-driving cars, to some extent, may replace trucks in order to improve parcel delivery for transport companies with a need for micro logistics around a city.\n\nIn the 2014 Ericsson ConsumerLab report, Connectivity Beyond the Screen, 67 percent of smartphone owners said they were interested in a same-day delivery service that works on any device, online and in stores. As an example of this, Amazon is gradually expanding its same-day and one-day delivery services (that initially started in the US) to many cities across the world, with Toronto in Canada being the most recent addition.13 Furthermore, Amazon has also started a rideshare-like delivery service called Amazon Flex, where drivers deliver parcels in a similar setup to companies such as Uber.14\n\nWhile autonomous vehicles may mean that those who love driving will get to do it less, there will be many other benefits to people both inside and outside the car.

"70.txt";"b'Last Updated 9/222020\n\nAccording to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA),""autonomous"" or ""self-driving"" vehicles are those in which operation of the vehicle occurs without direct driver input to control the steering, acceleration, and braking and are designed so that the driver is not expected to constantly monitor the roadway while operating in self-driving mode. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers predict that 75% of cars on the roads in the world will be autonomous by 2040. Moreover, a 2018 KPMG Study predicts that self-driving cars may become a commercial reality in the next five years.\n\nGoogle is the pioneer in autonomous driving technology. In 2005, Google established a team of engineers, led by Sebastian Thrun, who developed a robotic vehicle that won a contest sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Since 2009, Google (now Waymo), has been test-driving autonomous vehicles on public roads, traveling more than 10 million miles in over 25 U.S. cities. According to previous crash reports, Waymo cars have been in numerous minor accidents, but only one accident in 2016, was reported to be the fault of Google\'s self-driving car. In 2017, the company removed monthly accidents reports from their site and they will no longer be publicly available.\n\nWaymo continues to be the industry leader in driverless technology. In December of 2018, the company officially launched Waymo One, the nation\xe2\x80\x99s first autonomous vehicle taxi service, in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nGoogle believes that self-driving cars can make driving more efficient and safer by eliminating distracted driving and other human error. According to NHTSA, 3,166 fatalities in 2017 were crashes involving distracted drivers, while an additional 10,874 fatalities involved an alcohol-impaired driver. A KMPG report predicts that by 2050, the adoption of autonomous vehicle technology could reduce the frequency of accidents by almost 90%.\n\nAs excitement and momentum for self-driving cars grows, there are numerous insurance questions that will need to be addressed before such vehicles take the road. For example: What happens if a self-driving car gets into an accident? Who is liable for the damages? Will the human ""copilot"" be at fault or will the car\'s manufacturer? Will the \'driver\' have to maintain a constant vigil on the road ahead at all times? What are they allowed to do inside the vehicle\xe2\x80\xa6can they nap, read a book or text message while the car does all the navigating? Will they even need a driver\'s license? A 2017 KMPG report highlights the ""chaotic middle"" the auto insurance industry is facing in this new period.\n\nThere is also a long list of safety and legal issues to iron out before self-driving cars hit the road. In September 2017, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) presented, Automated Driving Systems: A Vision for Safety, as part of U.S. Department of Transportation\'s (DOT) multimodal efforts to support the safe introduction of automation technologies. In July 2018, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) released the Comprehensive Management Plan for Automated Vehicle Initiatives as a response to the requirements in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (Omnibus Bill) signed into law on March 23, 2018, directing the (DOT) to conduct research on the development of Automated Vehicles (AV).\n\nCurrently, twenty-nine states and Washington D.C. have enacted legislation related to autonomous vehicles, while eleven governors issued executive orders regarding autonomous vehicles. Getting the technology to make the vehicles is only half the challenge; the other half will be creating a legal, liability and regulatory framework to govern their use on public streets.\n\nStatus: The NAIC Innovation and Technology (EX) Task Force is charged with monitoring emerging technologies like autonomous vehicles in the insurance sector. The Task Force provides a forum for discussion of innovation and technology developments in the insurance sector to provide resources for and educate state insurance regulators on how these developments impact consumer protection, insurer, and producer oversight. Additionally, the NAIC Center for Insurance Policy and Research (CIPR) held an Autonomous Vehicle forum in October 2018. Resources from this forum are available on the CIPR Events page. The CIPR also hosted a webinar, The Road Ahead for Autonomous Vehicles and Auto Insurance in December 2019. Both of these events provided insights on the future of insurance in the autonomous vehicle industry.'";"Autonomous Cars";"70.txt-Autonomous Cars"
"74.txt";"b'Autonomous vehicles are also known as self-driving cars, driverless cars, or robotic cars. The term self-driving car is becoming a standard as these technologies continue to mature.\n\nAutonomous vehicles rely on advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) systems to \xe2\x80\x9cunderstand\xe2\x80\x9d their environment and react to commands. Complex sensors and actuators, together with advanced computer vision functions are used to create a constantly updated map of their surroundings, detect the presence of nearby vehicles and pedestrians, measure distances and detect uneven surfaces in roads and sidewalks. Autonomous vehicles can also be interconnected with other external devices such as smart traffic lights and roads, although many of these ideas are still hypothetical.\n\nAn autonomous vehicle is a vehicle that can drive itself without input from a human driver. There are several types of self-driving vehicles, depending on their level of automation. These levels have been defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) which has set 6 of them adopted by the U.S. Department of Transportation ranging from Level 0 (fully manual) to Level 5 (fully autonomous).\n\nTechopedia Explains Autonomous Vehicle\n\nIn some ways, the story of the autonomous vehicle is a tale of technological evolution that is not finished yet, a gradual advance of integrated artificial intelligence services and sensor-based driver safety features that may or may not eventually replace human drivers entirely.\n\nAutonomous cars must rely on the presence of sensors situated in various parts of the vehicle to sense their surroundings. Lidar is mostly used for ranging purposes, measure distances, identify lane markings and anomalies such as holes and pits on the road.\n\nRadar sensors are used to track other vehicles, while video cameras can be used to read road signs and detect traffic lights. Advanced AI-powered software will then process all those inputs coming from sensors, and generate instructions to the car\xe2\x80\x99s actuators to plot paths, control steering, braking and acceleration, or dodge obstacles.\n\nEarly Advances in Autonomous Vehicles\n\nThe earliest edge of the autonomous driving frontier was the evolution of multiple driver safety features that are now standard in many new vehicles. For example, a lane departure warning system alerts drivers if the vehicle seems to be leaving a particular space on a multilane road. Parking assist features, automated braking, and other features also apply. Each one has its own specialized function and controls a given task.\n\nWhat these systems have in common is that, although they promote the idea of autonomous vehicle design, they still do not approach what some would call a self-driving car. The human driver is still in control, and needs to be in control, but utilizes the warnings and alerts to make better driving decisions.\n\nThese forms of partial automation that still require a human driver pertain to the SAE levels 0 to 2. Only when the automated system is in charge of monitoring the driving environment and human intervention is purely optional then a vehicle could be defined as \xe2\x80\x9cautonomous\xe2\x80\x9d (levels 3 to 5). As we progress toward autonomous vehicle design, intermediate types of autopilot systems are becoming more common, with Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s one being probably the most prominent.\n\nObstacles to Adoption of Autonomous Cars Technology\n\nFully autonomous (Level 5) vehicles are currently being tested, but we\xe2\x80\x99re still far from making them available to the general public. Although the autonomous vehicle has come a long way, it is not yet a common mode of transportation, and various obstacles to adoption apply.\n\nIn particular, some of the technologies required for build a functional self-driving car very expensive, making the final cost of each vehicle prohibitive for the general public. Radar and Lidar work for prototypes, but if mass production is achieved, their signals and frequency might interfere with one another.\n\nMany anomalous conditions such as snow, debris or oil may represent a significant challenge whenever they cover lane markings and dividers. Also, it\xe2\x80\x99s still early to trust AI to be smart enough to make consistent decisions or split-second judgement calls in life-or-death scenarios, such as when a pedestrian suddenly traverses the road after a steep turn.'";"Autonomous Cars";"74.txt-Autonomous Cars"

Learn why this has hundreds of software teams building their applications in the cloud across multiple use cases and industries.\n\nPresented by Pony.ai\n\nThe vision of safe, reliable autonomous vehicle transportation at scale is closer than ever to being realized, says James Peng, CEO at Pony.ai. Since the company\xe2\x80\x99s founding in Fremont, California in late 2016, the company\xe2\x80\x99s been making strides in autonomous mobility deployment in both the U.S. and China. The company was the first to launch and offer a public-facing Robotaxi service in both countries.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe technology is moving from experience-level to application,\xe2\x80\x9d Peng says. \xe2\x80\x9cThe first half of the game is to build stable and mature products and accumulate experience. The second half is to move from R&D to mass production and scale, in addition to achieving commercially viable products.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn 2019, Peng predicted that the world would see a wide adoption of fully autonomous driving vehicles on the open roads within five years, and that forecast is gaining momentum. Pony.ai just received a driverless permit from California DMV, a milestone for their engineers to perform driverless testing without a human driver behind the wheel on public roads within the state. These tests are accelerating commercial growth across their operation sites worldwide, and they plan to launch driverless Robotaxi service to the public in California starting in 2022.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m pretty confident that in many of the larger cities in the U.S., people will soon be able to ride with a driverless Robotaxi vehicle,\xe2\x80\x9d says Tiancheng Lou, CTO at Pony.ai. \xe2\x80\x9cA significant portion of taxi services will be supported by driverless vehicles.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPony.ai currently offers ride-hailing in its autonomous vehicles in five markets: Irvine and Fremont in California; as well as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou in China. The company plans to install its technology in hundreds of vehicles next year, rising to tens of thousands in 2024-2025.\n\nWaymo, Google\xe2\x80\x99s self-driving car arm, has been piloting a fleet of fully driverless robotaxis in Phoenix for the past year, while Amazon-owned Zoox unveiled its autonomous robotaxi service last December.\n\nThe goals of autonomous driving\n\nAccording to most companies, the biggest benefit of autonomous driving is safety. The U.S. Department of Transportation has reported that 94% of car crashes are caused by human error. While overall driving was down in 2020 because of the pandemic, traffic fatality rates surged 24% \xe2\x80\x94 the highest spike in nearly a century. Autonomous driving is the solution to this issue, Peng says, and companies like Pony.ai, Google, and Uber, along with most of the major automakers, are sinking considerable money into R&D, optimistic about the future of autonomous driving.\n\nA transition to autonomous vehicles also has potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and support U.S. economic growth, points out the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets. The coalition, which includes members Ford, Volvo, Lyft, Uber, and Waymo, promotes the benefits of fully self-driving vehicles and supports the fastest deployment possible \xe2\x80\x93 or advancing the scale of the technology, which would enable mass production and start moving autonomous vehicles to the center of the smart city vision.\n\nChallenges of driving autonomy at scale\n\nPony is hoping to achieve large enough scale to reduce costs and meet commercial needs by 2022 with Alpha X, the working name for their latest generation of autonomous vehicles, Lou says, which are designed to be manufactured on a production line.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo have a large number of vehicles, we need to manufacture them in a standardized way,\xe2\x80\x9d Lou says. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a critical step to achieve front-loading mass production of self-driving cars.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe company established a production line and a set of standardized processes specifically for L4-level autonomous driving systems last November. With the support of the production line, the production efficiency of the autonomous driving system doubled six times compared with the previous generation, and production pace accelerated.\n\nWith PonyAlpha X, they established a L4 level autonomous driving system scale production line, Lou says. To manufacture the vehicle, they established a supply chain management process, hardware module design and verification, test production, and car conversion before final assembly. The end phase consists of overall quality inspection, off-line calibration, and road testing. The project helps them set up a standardized production process, which shortened production time, effectively reduced costs, and improved the stability of the overall system.\n\nCompared with the previous generation, PonyAlpha X is more compact, integrated, and lightweight in terms of system hardware integration, reducing the cost of post-maintenance. They recently partnered with Toyota to equip PonyAlpha X on Lexus RX models.\n\nIn February of this year, the company rolled out the new self-driving vehicles equipped with the latest generation system from the standardized production line. The cars will go through all-day autonomous-driving open-road tests in Guangzhou, Beijing, and Shanghai before they join the company\xe2\x80\x99s Robotaxi fleet for large-scale operations.\n\nTheir recent partnership with Luminar, an autonomous vehicle sensor and software company, has also allowed them to significantly bring down the cost of manufacturing, which is always a major hurdle for mass production.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the next generation, one of the biggest challenges is we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to use auto-grade sensors,\xe2\x80\x9d Lou says. \xe2\x80\x9cOne of the critical pieces is Luminar LiDAR. Using that LiDAR, we\xe2\x80\x99re moving one step toward to being ready for mass production, and then we can prepare for large scale production. Luminar LiDAR, compared to our current solution, is more reliable and much cheaper.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLiDAR is a laser sensor that sends millions of laser points out per second and measures how long they take to bounce back, a key component to safe autonomous driving. Luminar says that its Iris LiDAR has a maximum range of 500 meters (1,640 feet), including 250-meter range with less than 10 percent reflectivity. The self-driving sensor solution offers better perception accuracy and field of view breadth to enhance the ability to cope with long-tail scenarios. The new pony vehicles with Luminar\xe2\x80\x99s LiDAR sensor will be up and running in 2022, and will be ready for the company\xe2\x80\x99s robotaxi customers in 2023.\n\nAutonomous driving at scale is, literally, in sight\n\nThe past year hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been easy, Lou says, but it pushed their contactless delivery initiative further along in Irvine, which helped the community cope during the pandemic, while adding testing and collecting mileage for data points. But full autonomy at scale still requires testing.\n\nTo help accelerate their commercial growth and global deployment, they\xe2\x80\x99ve tapped Lawrence Steyn, vice chairman of investment banking at JPMorgan Chase & Co, as chief financial officer.\n\nAnd looking ahead, in 10 years or 20 years, it could be possible that owning a vehicle would entirely be a luxury, Lou says.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe need to carefully think about whether that\xe2\x80\x99s necessary, having personal vehicles,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it\xe2\x80\x99s mathematically possible to get a vehicle within as little as 30 seconds, most people may not have to own a vehicle.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHe also points out that if most vehicles are running autonomously, the vehicle form factor can be reshaped for accessibility, opening up safe transportation for a larger population of older and disabled riders who could turn to cheaper, more efficient autonomous transportation for their travel needs.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI still keep the engineering part in me, and with that part, I dream of pushing the world forward with state-of-art technology,\xe2\x80\x9d Peng says. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are working hard to largely scale and deploy our technology across countries and regions to benefit more and more people.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDig deeper.

Some of these driving aids are targeted at reducing driver stress, by taking over some or all steering functions, or automatically matching the car\xe2\x80\x99s speed to posted road signs. Certain systems, like Cadillac\xe2\x80\x99s Super Cruise, can only be used within specific parameters, such as pre-mapped divided highways with dedicated on- and off-ramps. There are also a number of active safety features, such as automatic emergency braking, that help minimize the risk of an accident by stopping the car if sensors detect an obstacle. While the era of robot cars hasn\xe2\x80\x99t yet arrived, let\xe2\x80\x99s look at examples of self-driving technology available today.\n\n<h3><strong>What Are the Levels of Vehicle Autonomy?</strong></h3> <p>To make things as simple as possible, let\xe2\x80\x99s explain the five levels of vehicle autonomy before we look at the cars and SUVs on this list. The levels of autonomy are determined by SAE International, a professional group of worldwide engineers devoted to establishing standardized values for the transportation field. To better understand self-driving cars, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand each level of autonomy.</p> <p>Level 0 means the car is always under human control. Cars in this category can have active safety features, like automatic emergency braking and forward collision warning, but these features only offer visual or audible alerts, and they never actively control the car.</p> <p>Level 1 vehicles might include adaptive cruise control or lane keep assist. These safety features are capable of providing a small degree of steering, acceleration, or braking input. However, their primary focus is accident avoidance. </p> <p>Level 2 autonomy entails several active safety features working in unison to take some degree of driving duty away from the driver. Onboard cameras and radar sensors could keep the car driving at a steady speed in its intended lane of travel, for example, and clear of surrounding vehicles. At this level you\xe2\x80\x99ll find a number of today\xe2\x80\x99s self-driving systems, such as Cadillac Super Cruise and Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s AutoPilot. One key thing to remember: A Level 2 vehicle requires the driver to remain focused on the road. This can be done via cameras that monitor the driver\xe2\x80\x99s eyes or sensors that can tell if the driver lets go of the steering wheel.</p> <p>At Level 3, a vehicle takes over all driving controls in select conditions and allows the driver to focus elsewhere. These conditions might be specific types of highway, or geofenced locations. The vehicle may not be able to drive itself in poor weather.</p> <p>At Level 4, the self-driving car is able to adapt to more road and weather conditions. The limitations of Level 3 are lessened, and the vehicle theoretically requires almost no driver input.</p> <p>Finally, at Level 5, the car drives all the time, no matter the type of road or weather outside. This robo-car is the end game for self-driving technology, though it remains years into the future.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>2020 Tesla Model S</strong></h3> <p><strong>Price w/ Autonomous Driving Features: $69,420 | U.S. News Overall Score: 9.0/10</strong></p> <p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s start with the car company and electric-powered sedan that put self-driving technology on the map. True, the idea of robo-cars didn\xe2\x80\x99t start with Tesla, but the Silicon Valley-based automaker has put them front and center in terms of cutting-edge car technology. </p> <p>Every <a href=""/cars-trucks/tesla/model-s/2020"">Model S</a> is fitted with Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s AutoPilot self-driving aid, though you can upgrade to the Full Self-Driving Capability package for an extra $8,000. While AutoPilot maintains vehicle speed and keeps the Model S in its intended lane of travel, Full Self-Driving Capability allows for lane changes (if the sensors detect it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to do so), automatic parking assist, and a mode to summon the car from a parking spot. </p> <p>Tesla remains at the forefront of this technology, though the company\xe2\x80\x99s reputation has been dinged by high profile accidents while its vehicles were operating with some degree of autonomy. This has often been linked to driver inattention, though the fact that AutoPilot usage is not geo-fenced to certain roads \xe2\x80\x93 such as the next system we\xe2\x80\x99re going to discuss \xe2\x80\x93 has been a heated safety topic.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>2020 Cadillac CT6</strong></h3> <p><strong>Price w/ Autonomous Driving Features: $74,495 | U.S. News Overall Score: 7.2/10</strong></p> <p>While Tesla has adopted a more free-spirited attitude to self-driving assistance, the Cadillac Super Cruise system takes a more measured approach. Like Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s AutoPilot, when Super Cruise is in operation the car maintains its speed, distance to other vehicles, and adheres to its intended lane of travel. </p> <p>Unlike some rival lane keep assist technology, Super Cruise is credited for being very smooth and avoiding the \xe2\x80\x98ping-pong\xe2\x80\x99 feel that other systems cause as onboard sensors read and respond to lane markings. This is a hands-free system, but a camera in the interior keeps an eye on the driver to make certain they\xe2\x80\x99re looking ahead and paying attention. If that isn\xe2\x80\x99t the case, Super Cruise will issue a series of visual and audible alerts. Should this still not get the driver\xe2\x80\x99s attention, the car will turn on its hazard lights and slow to a stop in its lane of travel.</p> <p>Available on the <a href=""/cars-trucks/cadillac/ct6/2020"">CT6</a> luxury sedan in the Premium Luxury trim level, Super Cruise can only be activated on divided highways with dedicated on-ramps and off-ramps. </p> <p>As of this writing, roughly 130,000 miles of roads throughout North America have been programmed into Super Cruise. For the 2021 model year, this technology will be available in the new <a href=""/cars-trucks/cadillac/escalade/2021"">Escalade</a> full-size SUV, along with the <a href=""/cars-trucks/cadillac/ct4/2020"">CT4</a> and <a href=""/cars-trucks/cadillac/ct5/2020"">CT5</a> sedans.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>2020 Nissan Rogue</strong></h3> <p><strong>Price w/ Autonomous Driving Features: $28,670 | U.S. News Overall Score: 7.6/10</strong></p> <p>Nissan takes a slightly simpler approach with its self-driving technology. Called ProPilot Assist, the system is available on the compact <a href=""/cars-trucks/nissan/rogue/2020"">Rogue</a> SUV and <a href=""/cars-trucks/nissan/leaf/2020"">Leaf</a> electric hatchback. </p> <p>While it\xe2\x80\x99s similar to Super Cruise in that the system maintains speed and a safe distance to vehicles ahead, the steering requires the driver\xe2\x80\x99s hands to remain on the wheel. ProPilot offers more of a gentle nudge in corners, though sharper bends will cause it to default back to the driver\'s control. </p> <p>Nissan touts ProPilot Assist as a way to relieve daily driving stresses and it will feature in more models in the years ahead. A more advanced ProPilot Assist 2.0 system is also on the road, though it\xe2\x80\x99s not yet in the U.S. market.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>2020 BMW X7</strong></h3> <p><strong>Price w/ Autonomous Driving Features: $75,600 | U.S. News Overall Score: 7.7/10</strong></p> <p>The <a href=""/cars-trucks/bmw/x7/2020"">BMW X7</a> is the German automaker\xe2\x80\x99s largest SUV and one of several models in which you can order hands-free parallel parking assist, along with traffic jam assist. This feature works at speeds below 40 mph and is intended to reduce the stress of heavy traffic. </p> <p>The car maintains its lane position and will slow to a complete stop if traffic ahead comes to a halt. This feature can be had on several BMW vehicles, including the <a href=""/cars-trucks/bmw/7-series/2020"">7 Series</a> and <a href=""/cars-trucks/bmw/5-series/2020"">5 Series</a> sedans.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>2020 Infiniti QX50</strong></h3> <p><strong>Price w/ Autonomous Driving Features: $52,575 | U.S. News Overall Score: 7.5/10</strong></p> <p>If you\xe2\x80\x99d like Nissan\xe2\x80\x99s ProPilot Assist system in fancier packaging, consider the <a href=""/cars-trucks/infiniti/qx50/2020"">Infiniti QX50</a>. The QX50 is a five-passenger compact SUV that comes standard with active safety items like automatic emergency braking, forward and rear collision warning, pedestrian detection, rear cross traffic alert, and more. </p> <p>ProPilot Assist works like it does in the <a href=""/cars-trucks/nissan/rogue/2020"">Nissan Rogue</a> and <a href=""/cars-trucks/nissan/leaf/2020"">Leaf EV</a>, the driver must keep their hands on the wheel as the system controls speed, braking, and a degree of steering and lane guidance.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>2020 Volvo XC60</strong></h3> <p><strong>Price w/ Autonomous Driving Features: $45,500 | U.S. News Overall Score: 8.3/10</strong></p> <p>Volvo has a sterling reputation when it comes to safety technology, so you can trust the company won\xe2\x80\x99t have a Wild West approach to self-driving aids. </p> <p>Pilot Assist is a hands-on system that operates at speeds up to 80 mph. The system maintains speed, distance to cars ahead, and keeps the vehicle in its intended lane of travel.

This allows vehicles equipped with this tech to \xe2\x80\x98speak\xe2\x80\x99 to each other to issue warnings about potential road hazards or slippery road conditions. In addition to its long lineup of available active safety features, such as evasive steering assist and automatic speed limit assist, the S-Class can be equipped with Night Vision. This helps to spot animals or objects that normal headlights might fail to illuminate in time to avoid an accident.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>2021 Toyota RAV4</strong></h3> <p><strong>Price w/ Autonomous Driving Features: $26,050 | U.S. News Overall Score: 8.0/10</strong></p> <p>So far most of our focus has been on systems that actively take over speed, steering, and braking functions. While Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s AutoPilot and Cadillac\xe2\x80\x99s Super Cruise self-driving aids are impressive, they don\xe2\x80\x99t come cheap. While this technology trickles down to less expensive makes and models, many of today\xe2\x80\x99s most popular cars and SUVs deliver a surprising amount of active safety features as standard equipment. </p> <p>The <a href=""/cars-trucks/toyota/rav4/2021"">Toyota RAV4</a> is an extremely popular compact SUV that happens to come with a long lineup of active safety features for a starting price of around $26,000.

"81.txt";"b'While the major automakers are developing autonomous vehicles behind closed doors, we were able to experience Audi\xe2\x80\x99s latest prototype at Las Vegas\xe2\x80\x99 CES show in January. California, Florida, Michigan, and Nevada are the only states, along with Washington, D.C., that currently allow companies to test such vehicles on public roads.\n\nAudi\xe2\x80\x99s A7 test car is equipped with the company\xe2\x80\x99s traffic-jam assist feature, which uses an array of cameras, sensors, and radar to let the car take over the driving in highway traffic. In the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat was Bj\xc3\xb6rn Giesler, Ph.D., project leader for development of piloted driving at Audi AG, and in the backseat was an engineer equipped with a laptop and radio to monitor the system and communicate with our police escorts and other Audi vehicles.\n\nDuring rush-hour traffic, we headed out on Route 15, one of Las Vegas\xe2\x80\x99 major freeways. With the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s speed under 40 mph, a notification appeared that the system\xe2\x80\x99s pilot mode was available. Then with the push of a button on the steering wheel, the car took control and the instrument cluster graphic changed to an illustration of the road with vehicles in the lanes.\n\nAs Giesler took his hands off the wheel and his foot off the pedals, the vehicle seamlessly followed the car in front at a safe distance. When a vehicle cut into our lane, the A7 automatically slowed down and adjusted the distance. When that car moved out of the lane, our car again closed the gap with the next car in front. The driver can turn off the system at any time by placing his hands on the steering wheel and foot back on the pedals.\n\nWith the A7 in control, the driver could do other things, although sleeping was not one of them. The vehicle was equipped with two cameras with facial recognition that monitored the driver\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. Giesler showed off that feature in an unnerving moment. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to lie to you, this is still pretty scary for me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said as he pretended to sleep. After about 10 seconds the vehicle noticed. An audible alert sounded and, when he still didn\xe2\x80\x99t open his eyes, the vehicle shut down in the middle of the highway and activated the hazard lights. That is a safeguard on the prototype A7 in case the driver is ill or incapacitated. But production cars will be designed so that they can make autonomous lane changes, which will allow the vehicle to safely pull off the road.\n\nDuring the demonstration, Giesler pointed out an eye-opening reminder of how quickly the technology is advancing. The previous year the test car\xe2\x80\x99s trunk was filled with three desktop-sized computers to make the system work. This year the hardware had been reduced to the size of a small box, which was tucked away in the trunk\xe2\x80\x99s side storage compartment.\n\nOverall we were quite impressed with the Audi\xe2\x80\x99s capabilities. The company expects the technology to be available in a production car within five years.'";"Autonomous Cars";"81.txt-Autonomous Cars"

Tesla is developing its own system. Most automakers, including General Motors (GM) and Ford (F), use proprietary in-house technology along with systems provided by suppliers such as Mobileye. Autonomous vehicles are complex and a handful of sophisticated firms will probably end up dominating the market, which is likely to be lucrative.\n\nShashua sees robotaxis arriving before self-driving cars consumers buy at dealerships. Mobileye, which was an Israeli company before Intel bought it for $15 billion in 2017, has permission to operate driverless taxis in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, most likely by the end of 2022, and in Munich as well. Two programs in California could allow driverless rides for hire on a similar timeframe\n\nMobileye driverless car is seen at the Nasdaq Market site in New York, U.S., July 20, 2021. REUTERS/Jeenah Moon\n\nRobotaxis will come first because companies like Uber or Lyft operating fleets of vehicles will be better able to absorb the cost than individual consumers. Robotaxis may also be easier to regulate, through rules governing their use inside a fixed geography such as a city\xe2\x80\x99s boundaries. Driverless cars for consumers probably need the ability to go virtually anywhere, plus some regulatory guidance that isn\xe2\x80\x99t yet fully developed. Level 4 autonomy could add $10,000 to $15,0000 to the cost of a vehicle, though that should come down as the technology scales up.\n\nThe United States isn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily ahead on autonomous vehicles. \xe2\x80\x9cI think China and Germany are in the lead position,\xe2\x80\x9d Shashua says. China has made self-driving technology one of its top industrial priorities, and Germany, home to Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz and BMW, has legally sanctioned AVs in ways the United States has not.

"87.txt";"b'The age of autonomous or self-driving cars is slowly creeping up on us and, with each new year that passes, semi-autonomous technology is getting better and better as we inch toward the day when human driving could be outlawed altogether. With that said, a recent report provided by Cox Automotive points out that 84-percent of people surveyed would still prefer the option of driving themselves, leaving just 16-percent of those surveyed willing to give up full control. To make matters worse, the overall acceptance of self-driving technology over the last two years has fallen by 18-percentage points. That probably, at least in part, comes thanks to recent high-profile autonomous car accidents, like the fatal accident with one of Uber\xe2\x80\x99s self-driving cars. As such, it\xe2\x80\x99s not surprising that automakers are scrambling to prove that their autonomous technology is safe \xe2\x80\x93 we can always trust them, right?\n\nIn the video you see below, BMW has chosen one of its autonomous test vehicles with the co-star being none other than a scary-looking ghost in the woods. Naturally, the self-driving car stops in the middle of the road, long before it could run over the scary ghost because, you know, self-driving technology is just that good. As the video proceeds, the ghost opens the car door to find nobody in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat, gets scared, and scurries off into the woods like a very naughty mouse that was caught in your kitchen cupboard. Then we see the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cNOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF\xe2\x80\x9d flash across the screen.\n\nThis video can be seen in one of two ways. The way BMW wants you to see it is that its self-driving technology is so good that it can even stop for a lifeless entity in the middle of a dark wooded road in the middle of the night \xe2\x80\x93 a place where no car (or driver for that matter) really has any business being anyway. That\xe2\x80\x99s great- BMW\xe2\x80\x99s self-driving tech will stop for anything.

First off, why was this self-driving car in the middle of the darkest, creepiest looking wooded road in the middle of the night? Maybe the car had gone rogue after the passenger stopped to take a leak. A brave soul that would have been. But, I digress. I think the real message here is that even ghosts \xe2\x80\x93 the leftover souls of those that once walked this earth \xe2\x80\x93 are scared of self-driving technology. Now, that, my friends, is something to take note of. If a creepy ghost walking down a dark road in the middle of the night, with clear intentions of scaring the hell out of someone, is scared of self-driving cars, then shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we be scared of them as well?

"89.txt";"b'TOKYO -- Prices of one key type of the sensors used in autonomous cars are falling rapidly, raising hopes of accelerating progress in the development of self-driving technology.\n\nVelodyne Lidar, the leading manufacturer of lidar sensors, has developed a product with a price only one-hundredth of those up until now. This dramatic drop in price for the sensors at the heart of many autonomous car designs could rev up the speed of the evolution of self-driving vehicles.\n\nMost of today\'s autonomous vehicles are equipped with two key types of sensors: cameras and radars.\n\nSensors using lidar (light detection and ranging) work like radar systems, with the only difference being that they use laser light instead of radio waves.\n\nLidar technology uses near-infrared light to detect objects around a vehicle. The advantage of lidar is that it can generate precise three-dimensional images of everything from cars to traffic lights to pedestrians in a wide range of environments and under diverse lighting conditions.\n\nHonda Motor\'s new self-driving Legend luxury sedan, equipped with the world\'s first certified Level 3 autonomous driving technology, uses lidar sensors.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk, however, has famously disparaged lidar sensors, saying in 2019 that they are ""expensive sensors that are unnecessary"" and likening them to ""a whole bunch of expensive appendices.""\n\nMusk has shown such distaste for lidar technology mainly because lidar sensors have been so costly, with a system for one vehicle costing as much as $70,000. He has argued that sophisticated cameras are sufficient for self-driving cars\' vision systems.\n\nIndeed, the biggest hurdle to widespread lidar adoption has been an economic one.\n\nBut technological innovation has significantly undermined the assumption underlying Musk\'s argument.\n\nVelodyne CEO Anand Gopalan told Nikkei that Musk\'s view of lidar technology is ""five, six years out of date.""\n\nGopalan asked whether it is wise to rely on just one component for safety. ""If you\'re driving at 70 miles per hour, or 100 kilometers per hour, you\'re taking your hand off the steering wheel and you\'re shutting your brain off ... can you rely on just one sensor?"" he said.\n\nAs the costs of lidar sensors decline, they can be combined with cameras to create truly safe and affordable vision systems, he asserted. ""If lidar can become small and low-cost, [it will help] create a safe system.""\n\nMany major carmakers have apparently agreed. Velodyne\'s customer list includes Volkswagen and Honda.\n\nVelodyne CEO Anand Gopalan holds the company\'s new palm-size lidar unit.\n\nWhen Google initially started its autonomous vehicle research, it used custom-made lidar sensors from Velodyne. They were rotating models mounted on the roof.\n\nVelodyne has sharply reduced lidar production costs by developing solid-state lidars. This new approach has helped shrink the size of the sensors, eliminate moving parts in the optical mechanisms and enable the kind of mass manufacturing that has brought costs down.\n\nThe company\'s new model, its smallest so far, could be sold at around $100 in high-volume production. A sensor system composed of multiple lidars is capable of 360-degree vehicle coverage.\n\nAs the costs of making lidars fall further through mass production, the total cost of lidars per vehicle will likely fall sharply. ""Past 2025, I think you will see the cost of lidars come down even more, in the $700 range"" per vehicle, Gopalan said.\n\nLuminar Technologies, a U.S. vehicle sensor and software startup, has also developed low-priced lidar sensors priced at $500 to $1,000.\n\nLuminar\'s high-performance lidar sensors can accurately detect objects ahead of the car out to 250 meters away and grasp the situation around the vehicle with a perception accuracy of several centimeters. The sensors can also detect dark objects, like black debris or a person wearing black clothes, even on roads with minimum reflectivity.\n\nGermany\'s Daimler, Sweden\'s Volvo Cars, the Israel-based Intel unit Mobileye and Toyota Motor\'s research arm have adopted Luminar\'s lidar sensors for their self-driving prototypes.\n\nLuminar CEO Austin Russell stresses the crucial importance of focusing on safety in developing self-driving technologies. One accident per 100 people is not acceptable, Russell told Nikkei. The goal should be ""to have 99.99999999% -- 10 nines of reliability,"" he said.\n\nRussell was a child prodigy who memorized the whole periodic table at age 2 and made a cellphone on his own while he was an elementary school student. He obtained a patent for a water recycling system he invented when he was 13.\n\nUnder the guidance of billionaire Peter Thiel, a co-founder of PayPal, Russell founded Luminar at the age of 17. Following Luminar\'s listing on Nasdaq in December 2020 through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) -- a shell company that uses the proceeds from an IPO to acquire a private company -- he became a billionaire at age 25.\n\nBesides Luminar, more than five other U.S. lidar startups, including California-based Aeva, have gone public via a SPAC merger.\n\nIn recent years, progress in autonomous driving technology has been markedly slower than that for electric vehicles. One reason has been a rush of major automakers to expand their EV offerings in response to a global trend toward stricter regulatory restrictions on gasoline-powered cars aimed at reducing carbon emissions.\n\nAs their earnings have been battered by the COVID-19 pandemic, carmakers have concentrated their investment on electric vehicles while cutting their R&D spending on self-driving technology.\n\nThe walls of national regulations and high costs have also hampered the advancement of autonomous driving technology. But growing competition among Velodyne and its rivals to develop more accurate and less expensive lidar sensors could help the technology overcome these challenges and come into widespread use.\n\n""Various parts with falling prices, such as sensors and cameras, will help remedy shortcomings [of autonomous driving],"" said professor Toshio Ito at the Shibaura Institute of Technology, an expert in advanced driver assistance systems.\n\nA small number of players, mainly U.S. and Chinese tech companies, are dominating the self-driving business landscape due primarily to its high technological and financial hurdles.\n\nGeneral Motors\' autonomous driving subsidiary, GM Cruise; Waymo, which began as Google\'s self-driving car project; and China\'s Baidu are leading the pack in terms of testing self-driving cars on public roads in California and other parts of the U.S. They have covered far more distance than Daimler or Toyota.\n\nIn a notable strategic move by another tech giant, Amazon acquired the autonomous vehicle startup Zoox to develop driverless delivery vehicles.\n\nApple is another tech powerhouse that is raising its self-driving profile. Since 2017, the Palo Alto, California-based company has been test-driving its own models on public roads around its headquarters. According to documents the company submitted in the past to the state authority, Apple has been testing a Lexus-based self-driving vehicle. A Lexus equipped with self-driving systems provided by DeepRoute.ai, a Chinese company, has been spotted in the area.\n\nVelodyne\'s Gopalan welcomes entries by tech companies like those affiliated with Google\'s parent, Alphabet, and Apple into the mobility sector.\n\n""Their appetite to adopt new technologies like lidar ... is much faster than a traditional automotive [manufacturer]. And so their entry into the space has really forced the rest of the industry to innovate,"" he said.\n\nThese U.S. and Chinese tech companies, armed with not just accumulated test-driving data but also ample financial and human resources, are likely to remain on the leading edge of the self-driving revolution.'";"Autonomous Cars";"89.txt-Autonomous Cars"

"93.txt";"b'Friday, June 25, 2021\n\nDespite all the hype, fully self-driving cars are not yet commercially available to the public. In limited geographical areas, individuals can sometimes be passengers in these vehicles. However, mastering the technology behind these cars has proven highly costly, and a wider rollout has taken much longer than expected.\n\nEven Tesla, who offers an \xe2\x80\x9cAutopilot\xe2\x80\x9d feature and boasts that their cars can run by themselves, admits (sometimes) that there needs to be a human at the controls. This is partly because of the accidents that continue to occur when people allow the car to do what it promises to do: drive itself. Clearly, safety continues to be a significant concern.\n\nIn April of this year, a Tesla vehicle was involved in a fatal crash that killed two people. Just before the drive, eyewitnesses said that the parties left to test-drive the vehicle without a driver utilizing Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s Autopilot feature.\n\nTesla claims the accident occurred because there was no one behind the wheel. The company says they include a warning on when and where to use this feature in the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s manual. They also state on their website that active driver supervision is required, yet they continue to advertise the Autopilot feature as autonomous.\n\nSo, before we examine who\xe2\x80\x99s at fault if you\xe2\x80\x99re involved in an accident with a driverless car, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand the complexities surrounding self-driving cars, from what defines the term to current regulations and the latest developments in the industry.\n\nWHAT ARE SELF-DRIVING VEHICLES?\n\nThe terms \xe2\x80\x9cself-driving,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdriverless,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cautonomous\xe2\x80\x9d are often used synonymously, although there are important distinctions.\n\nSelf-driving vehicles have been assigned levels of autonomy by the NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration). Most cars on the road today operate at Level 1, where there are some autonomous functions such as cruise control or Lane-Keep Assist. It\xe2\x80\x99s worth noting that the NHTSA recently updated their descriptions of Levels 4 and 5 to include a greater degree of autonomy and lack of human intervention.\n\nThere has been some reluctance for people to grab onto the self-driving concept. However, according to forecaster Scott Hardman, as driving becomes more automated, people will drive more, based on his interviews with 35 Tesla BEV with Autopilot owners. Those interviewed perceived less stress and increased comfort associated with partial automation.\n\nIn the meantime, technology is moving forward amidst hope, some trepidation, and, most of all, confusion.\n\nESSENTIAL SELF-DRIVING VEHICLE STATS\n\nExact statistics about driverless vehicles are difficult to get due to the lack of mandates on reporting accidents and the lack of industry-wide standards, where confusion abounds. Nevertheless, here are some important numbers worth considering:\n\nMore than 80 companies are testing over 1,400 self-driving cars in the U.S.\n\nAbout half of the population familiar with self-driving cars say they would be willing to ride in them.\n\nThe Tsukuba Mechanical Engineering Laboratory in Japan launched the first primitive, semi-automated car in 1977.\n\nGoogle\xe2\x80\x99s self-driving car first crashed into a bus in February of 2016; there were no injuries.\n\nTesla autonomous vehicles have been involved in several accidents. The first accident that resulted in death occurred in Florida on May 7, 2016.\n\nThe first Uber self-driving car crash occurred on November 20, 2018, in Tempe, Arizona. The cause was human error and resulted in the death of pedestrian Elaine Hezerberg.\n\nUber was involved in 37 crashes prior to the fatal accident in 2018.\n\nWaymo, the self-driving division of Google parent company Alphabet, Inc., partnered with the trucking giant J.B. Hunt and began hauling commercial loads on Texas highways with Level 4 autonomous big-rig vehicles in March of 2020.\n\nWaymo has also been running a driverless taxi service in the Phoenix, Arizona area since 2018. In May of this year, one of these Waymo taxis got confused in Chandler, Arizona traffic and took off on its own. Fortunately, no one was injured.\n\nLyft predicts autonomous rides could arrive by 2023.\n\nMany experts say driverless cars are safer than those driven entirely by human operators. Regardless, accidents have occurred and will continue to take place for many reasons. But if you\xe2\x80\x99re involved in a driverless car accident, who\xe2\x80\x99s at fault? Do you have any recourse?\n\nWHO\xe2\x80\x99S TO BLAME IN A CRASH?\n\nThe blame, or cause, of the accident, can be murky at best and may rest with more than one party. That\xe2\x80\x99s why it is essential to have a professional and experienced personal injury attorney on your side to accurately assess the situation, interpret the data, and consult the right experts to support your case and present it properly to the court.\n\nWHAT TO DO IF YOU\xe2\x80\x99RE IN AN ACCIDENT WITH A DRIVERLESS CAR\n\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re involved in an accident of any kind, you\xe2\x80\x99ll want to seek medical help as soon as possible.

I don\xe2\x80\x99t stand a chance.\n\nAll those dreams I had of a car that would take me to doctor appointments in my old age, drop me off at the door, park itself, then come get me when I was done? Poof! Up in smoke, like so many semi-autonomous cars that run into things.\n\nBiondi used to be an assistant professor at the University of Utah, where he conducted tests on volunteers who drove back and forth to Wendover in semi-autonomous cars. They drove one way manually and let the car handle much of the driving in the other direction. They wore contraptions that measured brain waves and had video recorders trained on them, which eventually demonstrated that people tend to lose focus when their cars automatically stay in their lanes and brake for traffic ahead.\n\nWhich is a problem, because those cars aren\xe2\x80\x99t really ready to drive themselves.\n\nIn other words, it\xe2\x80\x99s more dangerous to drive today\xe2\x80\x99s semi-autonomous cars than to pilot that old, dusty beater that requires you to do everything \xe2\x80\x94 brake, accelerate, turn, switch on the radio and watch out for the other guy \xe2\x80\x94 all by yourself.\n\nIf your beater has a manual transmission, you don\xe2\x80\x99t even have a hand free to text while driving.\n\nRelated Legislature approves bill allowing driverless cars on Utah roads\n\nToday, Biondi is a fully tenured assistant professor at the University of Windsor, in Canada. His window lets him look across the river toward Detroit, which once was the symbol of America\xe2\x80\x99s booming automobile industry. He\xe2\x80\x99s still very much involved in similar research.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think that the industry assumed it would be much easier,\xe2\x80\x9d he said about self-driving cars. The reason they were wrong is something that ought to make all of us feel proud:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs much as we like to think that humans are not as smart as machines \xe2\x80\xa6 that\xe2\x80\x99s far from being the case. Even after years of testing, autonomous cars are unable to match the human driver\xe2\x80\x99s performances. There are a lot of scenarios \xe2\x80\x94 weather conditions, road conditions \xe2\x80\x94 where these cars are not as smart as we want them to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSo, rogue machines aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to take over the world any time soon. That\xe2\x80\x99s good news, even though it won\xe2\x80\x99t help me get to the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s office as an old man.\n\nAnd yet that message doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be widespread knowledge. At least, that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the case last April in Texas when two men decided to go for a ride in a Tesla, with one apparently in the back seat and the other in the front passenger seat \xe2\x80\x94 and no one behind the wheel.\n\nThe New York Times said their wives overheard the men talking about the car\xe2\x80\x99s autopilot features as they left. They died when the car left the road on a steep turn.\n\nBiondi said evidence shows many people who buy semi-autonomous cars overestimate what they can do. Dealerships sometimes oversell the products or leave out information about limitations.\n\nMims, of The Wall Street Journal, suggests some experts think the whole idea needs to be rethought. They want to approach the necessary artificial intelligence by building systems that learn the way human babies do. Others want to divide the problem into smaller chunks, developing systems that each handle a piece of the puzzle.\n\nBiondi said he thinks commercial trucking shows more promise at the moment, especially if it involves dedicating lanes of traffic for that use only.\n\nTo me, it all sounds long and laborious and so \xe2\x80\xa6 well \xe2\x80\xa6 20th century.\n\nIt also sounds like I\xe2\x80\x99d better be prepared for that day when, as with my Dad and those before him, the kids discreetly take my keys from me and, in my decrepit state, I have to bum a ride to the doctor. What a bother.\n\nJay Evensen is a senior columnist for Deseret News.'";"Autonomous Cars";"95.txt-Autonomous Cars"
"96.txt";"b'The most remarkable thing about a ride in a robot car is how unremarkable it is.\n\nIt is definitely eerie to see the steering wheel turn by itself, the car brake and change lanes without human intervention. But just as with cruise control, it soon feels commonplace.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve been covering autonomous driving for several years so I\xe2\x80\x99ve taken lots of these rides \xe2\x80\x94 often carefully choreographed to show the cars to best advantage.\n\nFive years ago, I perched nervously in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat of a self-driving Uber Ford Fusion in Pittsburgh, ready to take the wheel as it crisscrossed the city\xe2\x80\x99s notorious bridges. I chugged around the campus of Santa Clara University in a converted golf cart from Auro Robotics, and barreled down Interstate 280 in a self-driving big rig from Otto. Alongside Zoox co-founder Jesse Levinson, who narrated the trip like a proud parent, I wound through narrow San Francisco streets in 2018. Scientists at Stanford University, UC Berkeley and Nissan Research Center told me how they are facilitating communication between robot cars and humans.\n\nWednesday\xe2\x80\x99s jaunt in Waymo\xe2\x80\x99s self-driving Jaguar I-Pace had no surprises. The car smoothly glided to a stop at intersections and signaled before turns. The closest thing to a hiccup was a slight jerkiness when it pulled over to drop off us faux ride-hailing passengers. The company confined our 20-minute test drive to the wide, relatively empty streets of the Sunset District, avoiding the hills and traffic elsewhere in the city, so the car didn\xe2\x80\x99t face any challenges. Ever Guardado, our safety driver, never needed to assume control, but did so once at my request just to demonstrate the tones the car sounds when a driver takes over.\n\nFour years ago when I rode in an earlier-generation Waymo robot car at its testing site on a former military base in Merced County, Waymo staged several complex situations: a bicyclist pedaling alongside, a pedestrian wandering into the crosswalk, a car abruptly cutting off the robot car and boxes sprawling into the road. That robot car, which did not have a person behind the wheel, adapted quickly to all the tests thrown at it.\n\nWaymo, an arm of Google parent Alphabet, now has the distinction of running San Francisco\xe2\x80\x99s first robot taxi service for the public, albeit with backup drivers behind the wheel and limits on how many folks it will accept into its testing program.\n\nJessica Christian/The Chronicle\n\nFleets of robot taxis are how Waymo, Cruise, Zoox and other main contenders in the self-driving race hope to eventually recoup their investors\xe2\x80\x99 multibillion-dollar investments.\n\nWhy test robot taxis in San Francisco?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a major ride-hailing market with a lot of demand from residents,\xe2\x80\x9d said spokesperson Julianne McGoldrick. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the toughest environments for driving \xe2\x80\x94 weather, traffic, road grade, cyclists.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn other words, if a robot car can make it here, it can make it anywhere. That\xe2\x80\x99s also the philosophy of several of Waymo\xe2\x80\x99s competitors, notably GM spin-off Cruise, whose white Chevy Bolts are a common sight on city streets.\n\nWaymo is far along on robot taxis in Phoenix, a much easier city to navigate. It\xe2\x80\x99s given rides to selected testers since 2017, jettisoned the backup drivers since 2019 and now, for almost a year, has been giving hundreds of fully autonomous paid rides \xe2\x80\x94 sans backup driver \xe2\x80\x94 every week to any member of the public who summons one via the Waymo One app, which works pretty much like any other ride-hailing app.\n\nEven when there\xe2\x80\x99s no driver in the car, Waymo has operations specialists who monitor the rides via cameras on the dashboard and the back seat. At a ride\xe2\x80\x99s onset, they check that passengers are buckled up and haven\xe2\x80\x99t brought more than three people along. Riders can talk to them by pressing a button on the app or on a console in the back seat.\n\nJessica Christian/The Chronicle\n\nFor now San Francisco rides are free \xe2\x80\x94 Waymo doesn\xe2\x80\x99t yet have permission to charge a fee. And although it\xe2\x80\x99s had permission since 2018 to ditch backup drivers in California, it has not yet done so. Rival Cruise has been testing some cars without backup drivers in San Francisco for nine months.\n\nBut McGoldrick said its trajectory here to fully autonomous paid rides will be quicker than that in Phoenix.\n\nBack in 2016, lots of smart people said fully autonomous cars would be ubiquitous by 2020. AI researchers told me that their then-toddler-aged kids would never get driver\xe2\x80\x99s licenses.\n\nBut the prospect of robot cars \xe2\x80\x94 and the promise that they\xe2\x80\x99ll improve transportation, end traffic fatalities and reduce congestion \xe2\x80\x94 has stayed tantalizingly out of reach.\n\nAir Quality Tracker Check levels down to the neighborhood Ratings for the Bay Area and California, updated every 10 minutes\n\nThe technology got very far along \xe2\x80\x94 but not all the way. The public got disenchanted, especially after an Uber self-driving car struck and killed a pedestrian in 2018. Companies like Uber and Lyft sold off their self-driving units as the industry consolidated.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe low-hanging fruit in this field is some combination of slow speeds, simple environments and semi-supervised operations,\xe2\x80\x9d Bryant Walker Smith, a longtime industry observer and affiliate scholar at the Stanford Law School Center for Internet and Society, said in an email. \xe2\x80\x9cWaymo and Cruise have long been more interested in moon shots.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJessica Christian/The Chronicle\n\nThose companies need to find \xe2\x80\x9csweet spots that are both technically and financially feasible,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, noting that while Phoenix is technically much easier than the Bay Area, it\xe2\x80\x99s also much less lucrative.\n\nCurrent ride-hailing has low expenses, he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAn Uber trip is basically just a poorly paid driver in a midtier car.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut the robot car fleets, even though they eliminated the labor expenses, have to cover costs for cars that mount up to several hundred thousand dollars each, \xe2\x80\x9cas well as a vast infrastructure for remote human monitoring and support.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nTV and movies are replete with far-out images of the future. But I was most struck by a low-tech image in the comedy-drama series \xe2\x80\x9cCasual.\xe2\x80\x9d The final season, which aired in 2018, purportedly took place a couple of years in the future. How the show signaled that: Lead actress Michaela Watkins arrived at her home in a ride-hailing vehicle. The camera briefly panned to show that no one was in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat.\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of naturally interwoven use of robot cars that futurists \xe2\x80\x94 and Waymo, Cruise, etc. \xe2\x80\x94 are betting on.\n\nCarolyn Said is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Oh, and that pedestrian looks as if he might jaywalk in front of you, and that guy in the SUV sure is riding your rear bumper\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nOdds are you\xe2\x80\x99ll do just fine. You\xe2\x80\x99ll make the right adjustments in braking and accelerating, picking just the right moment to go in and out of your lane, all while carrying on a conversation with your passenger.\n\nGenerally, human drivers do relatively well with this kind of complexity. We\xe2\x80\x99re able to respond to the out-of-the-ordinary intuitively.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOn the other hand, we get bored, tired, and easily distracted. Even with all the improvements in automotive safety over the years and depressed vehicle miles traveled from the COVID-19 pandemic, an estimated 38,000 Americans died on the roads in 2020.\n\nAutonomous vehicles have long been promised as the solution, with their sensors that see far ahead in all kinds of weather and their ever-vigilant computers that follow the rules of the road with hyper focus.\n\nBut the reality is more complex. As often happens with new technologies, some challenges are harder than they seemed at first. In fact, the industry is going through a bit of a reset, with companies like Uber and Lyft selling their autonomous vehicle units.\n\nWhy is autonomy hard? The roadways are highly cluttered with many sizes and shapes of obstacles; various objects move in and out quickly and unpredictably; and human behavior is difficult for a machine to predict. Whenever people \xe2\x80\x9cact naturally\xe2\x80\x9d during an odd scenario, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good time to worry about autonomous vehicles.\n\nFor a long time, the answer appeared to be to let an autonomous vehicle do the bulk of the driving, but only with a human behind the wheel, ready to take over in case of failure. The best of both worlds, right?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nUnfortunately, no.\n\nResearch has shown that humans make poor safety drivers. By the time they gain situational awareness in an emergency, it\xe2\x80\x99s often too late to react. In fact, relying upon \xe2\x80\x9chuman fallback\xe2\x80\x9d might actually be more dangerous than fully automated systems.\n\nFurther, the approach of using virtual simulations to prove system safety is facing a harsh reality: The endlessly complex environment, coupled with constantly evolving hardware and software, means that relying upon systems to drive millions of simulated miles, while necessary, is insufficient.\n\nSo, the promise of widely deployed self-driving vehicles remains elusive.\n\nWe still think it\xe2\x80\x99s likely that highly automated vehicles, in some form and performing certain tasks, will become a reality. Where we first see these systems on the roads is uncertain: Maybe electric vehicles \xe2\x80\x94 cheaper to produce than complex gas vehicles \xe2\x80\x94 will include expensive autonomous systems; or maybe autonomous freight trucks on highways may have the right economic incentives for autonomy adoption.\n\nRegardless of which operational model succeeds, we believe there are four major steps we can take in the short term:\n\nLet autonomous vehicles communicate with one another through connected vehicle technology \xe2\x80\x94 The world is a complex place for autonomous vehicles. Weather makes it hard to virtually \xe2\x80\x9csee\xe2\x80\x9d with sensors; emergency responders alter the roadways to make accident scenes safe; and people around the vehicle are hidden by buildings and foliage. Any technology that simplifies this world is crucial to fast and safe adoption of these capabilities. Connected vehicle technology lets these systems \xe2\x80\x9ctalk\xe2\x80\x9d with each other and with the world around them, sharing information about traffic, objects, and intended vehicle paths. To make this vision a reality, industry and the government must come together to implement and standardize these communications, as well as invest in necessary infrastructure.\n\nThe world is a complex place for autonomous vehicles.

"98.txt";"b""Self-driving cars are being developed by several major technology companies and carmakers. credit: VCG/Getty\n\nWhen a driver slams on the brakes to avoid hitting a pedestrian crossing the road illegally, she is making a moral decision that shifts risk from the pedestrian to the people in the car. Self-driving cars might soon have to make such ethical judgments on their own \xe2\x80\x94 but settling on a universal moral code for the vehicles could be a thorny task, suggests a survey of 2.3 million people from around the world.\n\nThe largest ever survey of machine ethics1, published today in Nature, finds that many of the moral principles that guide a driver\xe2\x80\x99s decisions vary by country. For example, in a scenario in which some combination of pedestrians and passengers will die in a collision, people from relatively prosperous countries with strong institutions were less likely to spare a pedestrian who stepped into traffic illegally.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPeople who think about machine ethics make it sound like you can come up with a perfect set of rules for robots, and what we show here with data is that there are no universal rules,\xe2\x80\x9d says Iyad Rahwan, a computer scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge and a co-author of the study.\n\nThe survey, called the Moral Machine, laid out 13 scenarios in which someone\xe2\x80\x99s death was inevitable. Respondents were asked to choose who to spare in situations that involved a mix of variables: young or old, rich or poor, more people or fewer.\n\nPeople rarely encounter such stark moral dilemmas, and some critics question whether the scenarios posed in the quiz are relevant to the ethical and practical questions surrounding driverless cars. But the study\xe2\x80\x99s authors say that the scenarios stand in for the subtle moral decisions that drivers make every day. They argue that the findings reveal cultural nuances that governments and makers of self-driving cars must take into account if they want the vehicles to gain public acceptance.\n\nAt least one company working on self-driving cars \xe2\x80\x94 the German carmaker Audi \xe2\x80\x94 says that the survey could help prompt an important discussion about these issues. (Other firms with autonomous-vehicle programmes, including auto manufacturer Toyota and technology companies Waymo and Uber, declined to comment on the findings.) And Nicholas Christakis, a social scientist at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, is fascinated by the results.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a remarkable paper,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. The debate about whether ethics are universal or vary between cultures is an old one, says Christakis, and now the \xe2\x80\x9ctwenty-first century problem\xe2\x80\x9d of how to programme self-driving cars has reinvigorated it.\n\nThe road not taken\n\nSome of the world\xe2\x80\x99s biggest tech companies \xe2\x80\x94 including Google's parent, Alphabet; Uber; and Tesla \xe2\x80\x94 and carmakers now have self-driving car programmes. Many of these companies argue that the vehicles could improve road safety, ease traffic and improve fuel efficiency. Social scientists say the cars raise ethical issues, and could have unintended consequences for public safety and the environment.\xef\xbb\xbf\n\nIn 2016, Rahwan\xe2\x80\x99s team stumbled on an ethical paradox about self-driving cars2: in surveys, people said that they wanted an autonomous vehicle to protect pedestrians even if it meant sacrificing its passengers \xe2\x80\x94 but also that they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t buy self-driving vehicles programmed to act this way.\n\nCurious to see if the prospect of self-driving cars might raise other ethical condundrums, Rahwan gathered an international team of psychologists, anthropologists and economists to create the Moral Machine. Within 18 months, the online quiz had recorded 40 million decisions made by people from 233 countries and territories.\n\nNo matter their age, gender or country of residence, most people spared humans over pets, and groups of people over individuals. These responses are in line with rules proposed in what may be the only governmental guidance on self-driving cars: a 2017 report by the German Ethics Commission on Automated and Connected Driving.\n\nBut agreement ends there. When the authors analysed answers from people in the 130 countries with at least 100 respondents, they found that the nations could be divided into three groups. One contains North America and several European nations where Christianity has historically been the dominant religion; another includes countries such as Japan, Indonesia and Pakistan, with strong Confucian or Islamic traditions. A third group consists of Central and South America, as well as France and former French colonies. The first group showed a stronger preference for sacrificing older lives to save younger ones than did the second group, for example.\n\nThe researchers also identified correlations between social and economic factors in a country and the average opinions of its residents. The team found that people from countries with strong government institutions, such as Finland and Japan, more often chose to hit people who were crossing the road illegally than did respondents in nations with weaker institutions, such as Nigeria or Pakistan.\n\nScenarios that forced survey participants to choose whether to save a homeless person on one side of the road or an executive on the other revealed another point of departure: the choices people made often correlated with the level of economic inequality in their culture. People from Finland \xe2\x80\x94 which has a relatively small gap between the rich and the poor \xe2\x80\x94 showed little preference for swerving one way or the other. But the average respondent from Colombia \xe2\x80\x94 a country with significant economic disparity \xe2\x80\x94 chose to kill the lower-status person.\n\nAzim Shariff, a psychologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, finds this result interesting because it suggests that the survey really does reveal people\xe2\x80\x99s moral preferences. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you assume that places that have a lower level of income inequality have political policies that favor egalitarianism, this shows that the moral norms that support those policies are expressed in the way that people play these games.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPotholes ahead?\n\nAlthough autonomous vehicles aren't yet for sale to the public, test versions are cruising through several US cities. By 2021, at least five manufacturers hope to have self-driving cars and trucks in wide use.\n\nBryant Walker Smith, a law professor at the University of South Carolina in Columbia, is sceptical that the Moral Machine survey will have any practical use. He says that the study is unrealistic because there are few instances in real life in which a vehicle would face a choice between striking two different types of people. \xe2\x80\x9cI might as well worry about how automated cars will deal with asteroid strikes,\xe2\x80\x9d Walker Smith says.\n\nBut the study\xe2\x80\x99s authors say that their scenarios represent the minor moral judgements that human drivers make routinely \xe2\x80\x94 which can sometimes be fatal. A driver who veers away from cyclists riding on a curvy mountain road increases her chance of hitting an oncoming vehicle. If the number of driverless cars on the road increases, so too will the likelihood that they will be involved in such accidents.\n\nSome car companies are listening. Barbara Wege, who heads a group focused on autonomous-vehicle ethics at Audi in Ingolstadt, Germany, says such studies are valuable. Wege argues that self-driving cars would cause fewer accidents, proportionally, than human drivers do each year \xe2\x80\x94 but that events involving robots might receive more attention.\n\nSurveys such as the Moral Machine can help to begin public discussions about these inevitable accidents that might foster trust. \xe2\x80\x9cWe need to come up with a social consensus,\xe2\x80\x9d she says, \xe2\x80\x9cabout which risks we are willing to take.\xe2\x80\x9d""";"Autonomous Cars";"98.txt-Autonomous Cars"

Put a toy under a blanket and a child that old will know it is still there, and that he can reach underneath the blanket to get it back. This understanding, of \xe2\x80\x9cobject permanence\xe2\x80\x9d, is a normal developmental milestone, as well as a basic tenet of reality.\n\nListen to this story Your browser does not support the <audio> element. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.\n\nIt is also something that self-driving cars do not have. And that is a problem. Autonomous vehicles are getting better, but they still don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the world in the way that a human being does. For a self-driving car, a bicycle that is momentarily hidden by a passing van is a bicycle that has ceased to exist.\n\nThis failing is basic to the now-widespread computing discipline that has arrogated to itself the slightly misleading moniker of artificial intelligence ( AI ). Current AI works by building up complex statistical models of the world, but it lacks a deeper understanding of reality. How to give AI at least some semblance of that understanding\xe2\x80\x94the reasoning ability of a seven-month-old child, perhaps\xe2\x80\x94is now a matter of active research.\n\nModern AI is based on the idea of machine learning. If an engineer wants a computer to recognise a stop sign, he does not try to write thousands of lines of code that describe every pattern of pixels which could possibly indicate such a sign. Instead, he writes a program that can learn for itself, and then shows that program thousands of pictures of stop signs. Over many repetitions, the program gradually works out what features all of these pictures have in common.\n\nSimilar techniques are used to train self-driving cars to operate in traffic. Cars thus learn how to obey lane markings, avoid other vehicles, hit the brakes at a red light and so on. But they do not understand many things a human driver takes for granted\xe2\x80\x94that other cars on the road have engines and four wheels, or that they obey traffic regulations (usually) and the laws of physics (always). And they do not understand object permanence.\n\nIn a recent paper in Artificial Intelligence, Mehul Bhatt of Orebro University, in Sweden, who is also the founder of a firm called CoDesign Lab which is developing his ideas commercially, describes a different approach. He and his colleagues took some existing AI programs which are used by self-driving cars and bolted onto them a piece of software called a symbolic-reasoning engine.\n\nThe heart has its reasons...\n\nInstead of approaching the world probabilistically, as machine learning does, this software was programmed to apply basic physical concepts to the output of the programs that process signals from an autonomous vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s sensors. This modified output was then fed to the software which drives the vehicle. The concepts involved included the ideas that discrete objects continue to exist over time, that they have spatial relationships with one another\xe2\x80\x94such as \xe2\x80\x9cin-front-of\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbehind\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and that they can be fully or partly visible, or completely hidden by another object.\n\nAnd it worked. In tests, if one car momentarily blocked the sight of another, the reasoning-enhanced software could keep track of the blocked car, predict where and when it would reappear, and take steps to avoid it if necessary. The improvement was not huge. On standard tests Dr Bhatt\xe2\x80\x99s system scored about 5% better than existing software. But it proved the principle. And it also yielded something else. For, unlike a machine-learning algorithm, a reasoning engine can tell you the reason why it did what it did.\n\nYou could, for instance, ask a car fitted with a reasoning engine why it had hit the brakes, and it would be able to tell you that it thought a bicycle hidden by a van was about to enter the intersection ahead. A machine-learning program cannot do that. Besides helping improve program design, such information will, Dr Bhatt reckons, help regulators and insurance companies. It may thus speed up public acceptance of autonomous vehicles.\n\nDr Bhatt\xe2\x80\x99s work is part of a long-standing debate in the field of artificial intelligence. Early AI researchers, working in the 1950s, chalked up some successes using this sort of preprogrammed reasoning. But, beginning in the 1990s, machine learning improved dramatically, thanks to better programming techniques combined with more powerful computers and the availability of more data. Today almost all AI is based on it.\n\nDr Bhatt is not, though, alone in his scepticism. Gary Marcus, who studies psychology and neural science at New York University and is also the boss of an AI and robotics company called Robust. AI , agrees. To support his point of view, Dr Marcus cites a much-publicised result, albeit from eight years ago. This was when engineers at DeepMind (then an independent company, now part of Google) wrote a program that could learn, without being given any hints about the rules, how to play Breakout, a video game which involves hitting a moving virtual ball with a virtual paddle.\n\nDeepMind\xe2\x80\x99s program was a great player. But when another group of researchers tinkered with Breakout\xe2\x80\x99s code\xe2\x80\x94shifting the location of the paddles by just a few pixels\xe2\x80\x94its abilities plummeted. It was not able to generalise what it had learned from a specific situation even to a situation that was only slightly different.\n\nBack to the future\n\nFor Dr Marcus, this example highlights the fragility of machine-learning. But others think it is symbolic reasoning which is brittle, and that machine learning still has a lot of mileage left in it. Among them is Jeff Hawke, vice-president of technology at Wayve, a self-driving-car firm in London. Wayve\xe2\x80\x99s approach is to train the software elements running a car\xe2\x80\x99s various components simultaneously, rather than separately. In demonstrations, Wayve\xe2\x80\x99s cars make good decisions while navigating narrow, heavily trafficked London streets\xe2\x80\x94a task that challenges many humans.\n\nAs Dr Hawke puts it, \xe2\x80\x9cthe complexity of most real-world tasks is greater than is possible to solve with handcrafted rules, and it\xe2\x80\x99s well known that expert systems built with rules tend to struggle with complexity. This is true regardless of how well thought out or structured the formal logic is.\xe2\x80\x9d Such a system might, for instance, craft a rule that a car should stop at a red light. But lights are designed differently in different countries, and some are intended for pedestrians rather than cars. There are also situations in which you might need to jump a red light, such as to make way for a fire engine. \xe2\x80\x9cThe beauty of machine learning\xe2\x80\x9d, Dr Hawke says, \xe2\x80\x9cis that all these factors and concepts can be automatically uncovered and learned from data. And with more data, it continues to learn and become more intelligent.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNicholas Rhinehart, who studies robotics and AI at the University of California, Berkeley, also backs machine learning. He says Dr Bhatt\xe2\x80\x99s approach does indeed show you can combine the two approaches. But he is not sure it is necessary. In his work, and also that of others, machine-learning systems alone can already predict probabilities a few seconds into the future\xe2\x80\x94such as whether another car is likely to give way or not\xe2\x80\x94and make contingency plans based on those predictions.\n\nDr Bhatt responds that you can train a car with data accumulated over millions of kilometres of driving, and still not be sure you have covered all the necessary situations. In many cases, it might be simpler and more effective to program some of the rules in from the start.\n\nFor champions of both strategies, the question goes beyond self-driving cars to the future of AI itself. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think we're taking the right approach right now,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr Marcus says. \xe2\x80\x9c[Machine learning] has proven useful for some things like speech recognition, but it's not actually the answer to AI . We haven\xe2\x80\x99t really solved the intelligence problem.\xe2\x80\x9d One way or another, then, it seems seven-month-olds still have a lot to teach machines. \xe2\x96\xa0\n\nAn early version of this article was published online on September 1st 2021""";"Autonomous Cars";"99.txt-Autonomous Cars"
"1.txt";"b'Food produced from the seed of Theobroma cacao\n\nChocolate is a food product made from roasted and ground cacao pods, that is available as a liquid, solid or paste, on its own or as a flavoring agent in other foods. Cacao has been consumed in some form since at least the Olmec civilization (19th-11th century BCE),[1][2] and the majority of Mesoamerican people - including the Maya and Aztecs - made chocolate beverages.[3]\n\nThe seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor. After fermentation, the beans are dried, cleaned, and roasted. The shell is removed to produce cocoa nibs, which are then ground to cocoa mass, unadulterated chocolate in rough form. Once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating, it is called chocolate liquor. The liquor may also be cooled and processed into its two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter. Baking chocolate, also called bitter chocolate, contains cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions, without any added sugar. Powdered baking cocoa, which contains more fiber than cocoa butter, can be processed with alkali to produce dutch cocoa. Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, a combination of cocoa solids, cocoa butter or added vegetable oils, and sugar. Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder or condensed milk. White chocolate contains cocoa butter, sugar, and milk, but no cocoa solids.\n\nChocolate is one of the most popular food types and flavors in the world, and many foodstuffs involving chocolate exist, particularly desserts, including cakes, pudding, mousse, chocolate brownies, and chocolate chip cookies. Many candies are filled with or coated with sweetened chocolate. Chocolate bars, either made of solid chocolate or other ingredients coated in chocolate, are eaten as snacks. Gifts of chocolate molded into different shapes (such as eggs, hearts, coins) are traditional on certain Western holidays, including Christmas, Easter, Valentine\'s Day, and Hanukkah. Chocolate is also used in cold and hot beverages, such as chocolate milk and hot chocolate, and in some alcoholic drinks, such as creme de cacao.\n\nAlthough cocoa originated in the Americas, West African countries, particularly C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire and Ghana, are the leading producers of cocoa in the 21st century, accounting for some 60% of the world cocoa supply.\n\nWith some two million children involved in the farming of cocoa in West Africa, child slavery and trafficking were major concerns in 2018,[4][5] and continue to be. International attempts to improve conditions for children were doomed to failure because of persistent poverty, absence of schools, increasing world cocoa demand, more intensive farming of cocoa, and continued exploitation of child labor.[4]\n\nHistory\n\nMesoamerican usage\n\nTwo Mayans sit around a container of frothed chocolate.\n\nChocolate has been prepared as a drink for nearly all of its history. For example, one vessel found at an Olmec archaeological site on the Gulf Coast of Veracruz, Mexico, dates chocolate\'s preparation by pre-Olmec peoples as early as 1750 BC.[6] On the Pacific coast of Chiapas, Mexico, a Mokaya archaeological site provides evidence of cocoa beverages dating even earlier, to 1900 BC.[7][6] The residues and the kind of vessel in which they were found indicate the initial use of cocoa was not simply as a beverage, but the white pulp around the cocoa beans was likely used as a source of fermentable sugars for an alcoholic drink.[8]\n\nMan Carrying a Cacao Pod, 1440\xe2\x80\x931521. Volcanic stone, traces of red pigment. Aztec., 1440\xe2\x80\x931521. Volcanic stone, traces of red pigment. Brooklyn Museum\n\nAn early Classic-period (460\xe2\x80\x93480 AD) Mayan tomb from the site in Rio Azul had vessels with the Maya glyph for cocoa on them with residue of a chocolate drink, suggests the Maya were drinking chocolate around 400 AD.[9] Documents in Maya hieroglyphs stated chocolate was used for ceremonial purposes, in addition to everyday life.[10] The Maya grew cacao trees in their backyards,[11] and used the cocoa seeds the trees produced to make a frothy, bitter drink.[12]\n\nBy the 15th century, the Aztecs gained control of a large part of Mesoamerica and adopted cocoa into their culture. They associated chocolate with Quetzalcoatl, who, according to one legend, was cast away by the other gods for sharing chocolate with humans,[13] and identified its extrication from the pod with the removal of the human heart in sacrifice.[14] In contrast to the Maya, who liked their chocolate warm, the Aztecs drank it cold, seasoning it with a broad variety of additives, including the petals of the Cymbopetalum penduliflorum tree, chile pepper, allspice, vanilla, and honey.\n\nThe Aztecs were unable to grow cocoa themselves, as their home in the Mexican highlands was unsuitable for it, so chocolate was a luxury imported into the empire.[13] Those who lived in areas ruled by the Aztecs were required to offer cocoa seeds in payment of the tax they deemed ""tribute"".[13] Cocoa beans were often used as currency.[15] For example, the Aztecs used a system in which one turkey cost 100 cocoa beans and one fresh avocado was worth three beans.[16]\n\nThe Maya and Aztecs associated cocoa with human sacrifice, and chocolate drinks specifically with sacrificial human blood. The Spanish royal chronicler Gonzalo Fern\xc3\xa1ndez de Oviedo y Vald\xc3\xa9s described a chocolate drink he had seen in Nicaragua in 1528, mixed with achiote: ""because those people are fond of drinking human blood, to make this beverage seem like blood, they add a little achiote, so that it then turns red. ... and part of that foam is left on the lips and around the mouth, and when it is red for having achiote, it seems a horrific thing, because it seems like blood itself.""\n\nEuropean adaptation\n\nThe morning chocolate by Chocolate soon became a fashionable drink of the European nobility after the discovery of the Americas.by Pietro Longhi ; Venice, 1775\xe2\x80\x931780\n\nUntil the 16th century, no European had ever heard of the popular drink from the Central American peoples.[13] Christopher Columbus and his son Ferdinand encountered the cocoa bean on Columbus\'s fourth mission to the Americas on 15 August 1502, when he and his crew seized a large native canoe that proved to contain cocoa beans among other goods for trade.[19] Spanish conquistador Hern\xc3\xa1n Cort\xc3\xa9s may have been the first European to encounter it, as the frothy drink was part of the after-dinner routine of Montezuma.[9][20] Jos\xc3\xa9 de Acosta, a Spanish Jesuit missionary who lived in Peru and then Mexico in the later 16th century, wrote of its growing influence on the Spaniards:\n\nAlthough bananas are more profitable, cocoa is more highly esteemed in Mexico. . . Cocoa is a smaller fruit than almonds and thicker, which toasted do not taste bad. It is so prized among the Indians and even among Spaniards. . . because since it is a dried fruit it can be stored for a long time without deterioration, and they brings ships loaded with them from the province of Guatemala. . . It also serves as currency, because with five cocoas you can buy one thing, with thirty another, and with a hundred something else, without there being contradiction; and they give these cocoas as alms to the poor who beg for them. The principal product of this cocoa is a concoction which they make that they call \xe2\x80\x9cchocolate,\xe2\x80\x9d which is a crazy thing treasured in that land, and those who are not accustomed are disgusted by it, because it has a foam on top and a bubbling like that of feces, which certainly takes a lot to put up with. Anyway, it is the prized beverage which the Indians offer to nobles who come to or pass through their lands; and the Spaniards, especially Spanish women born in those lands die for black chocolate. This aforementioned chocolate is said to the be made in various forms and temperaments, hot, cold, and lukewarm. They are wont to use spices and much chili; they also make it into a paste, and it is said that it is a medicine to treat coughs, the stomach, and colds. Whatever may be the case, in fact those who have not been reared on this opinion are not appetized by it.[21]\n\n""Trait\xc3\xa9s nouveaux & curieux du caf\xc3\xa9 du th\xc3\xa9 et du chocolate"", by Philippe Sylvestre Dufour, 1685 , by Philippe Sylvestre Dufour, 1685\n\nWhile Columbus had taken cocoa beans with him back to Spain,[19] chocolate made no impact until Spanish friars introduced it to the Spanish court.[13] After the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs, chocolate was imported to Europe. There, it quickly became a court favorite. It was still served as a beverage, but the Spanish added sugar, as well as honey (the original sweetener used by the Aztecs for chocolate), to counteract the natural bitterness.[22] Vanilla, another indigenous American introduction, was also a popular additive, with pepper and other spices sometimes used to give the illusion of a more potent vanilla flavor. Unfortunately, these spices tended to unsettle the European constitution; the Encyclop\xc3\xa9die states, ""The pleasant scent and sublime taste it imparts to chocolate have made it highly recommended; but a long experience having shown that it could potentially upset one\'s stomach"", which is why chocolate without vanilla was sometimes referred to as ""healthy chocolate"".[23] By 1602, chocolate had made its way from Spain to Austria.[24] By 1662, Pope Alexander VII had declared that religious fasts were not broken by consuming chocolate drinks. Within about a hundred years, chocolate established a foothold throughout Europe.[13]\n\nmoulinet or swizzle stick, London 1714\xe2\x80\x9315 ( Silver chocolate pot with hinged finial to insert aor swizzle stick, London 1714\xe2\x80\x9315 ( Victoria and Albert Museum\n\nThe new craze for chocolate brought with it a thriving slave market, as between the early 1600s and late 1800s, the laborious and slow processing of the cocoa bean was manual.[13] Cocoa plantations spread, as the English, Dutch, and French colonized and planted. With the depletion of Mesoamerican workers, largely to disease, cocoa production was often the work of poor wage laborers and African slaves. Wind-powered and horse-drawn mills were used to speed production, augmenting human labor. Heating the working areas of the table-mill, an innovation that emerged in France in 1732, also assisted in extraction.[25]\n\nNew processes that sped the production of chocolate emerged early in the Industrial Revolution. In 1815, Dutch chemist Coenraad van Houten introduced alkaline salts to chocolate, which reduced its bitterness.[13] A few years thereafter, in 1828, he created a press to remove about half the natural fat (cocoa butter or cocoa butter) from chocolate liquor, which made chocolate both cheaper to produce and more consistent in quality. This innovation introduced the modern era of chocolate.[19]\n\nKnown as ""Dutch cocoa"", this machine-pressed chocolate was instrumental in the transformation of chocolate to its solid form when, in 1847, English chocolatier Joseph Fry discovered a way to make chocolate moldable when he mixed the ingredients of cocoa powder and sugar with melted cocoa butter.[22] Subsequently, his chocolate factory, Fry\'s of Bristol, England, began mass-producing chocolate bars, Fry\'s Chocolate Cream, launched in 1866, and they became very popular.[26] Milk had sometimes been used as an addition to chocolate beverages since the mid-17th century, but in 1875 Swiss chocolatier Daniel Peter invented milk chocolate by mixing a powdered milk developed by Henri Nestl\xc3\xa9 with the liquor.[13][19] In 1879, the texture and taste of chocolate was further improved when Rudolphe Lindt invented the conching machine.[27]\n\nBesides Nestl\xc3\xa9, several notable chocolate companies had their start in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Rowntree\'s of York set up and began producing chocolate in 1862, after buying out the Tuke family business. Cadbury was manufacturing boxed chocolates in England by 1868.[13] Manufacturing their first Easter egg in 1875, Cadbury created the modern chocolate Easter egg after developing a pure cocoa butter that could easily be molded into smooth shapes.[28] In 1893, Milton S. Hershey purchased chocolate processing equipment at the World\'s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, and soon began the career of Hershey\'s chocolates with chocolate-coated caramels.\n\nIntroduction to the United States\n\nThe Baker Chocolate Company, which makes Baker\'s Chocolate, is the oldest producer of chocolate in the United States. In 1765 Dr. James Baker and John Hannon founded the company in Boston. Using cocoa beans from the West Indies, the pair built their chocolate business, which is still in operation.[29][30]\n\nWhite chocolate was first introduced to the U.S. in 1946 by Frederick E. Hebert of Hebert Candies in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, near Boston, after he had tasted ""white coat"" candies while traveling in Europe.[31][30]\n\nEtymology\n\nCocoa, pronounced by the Olmecs as kakawa,[1] dates to 1000 BC or earlier.[1] The word ""chocolate"" entered the English language from Spanish in about 1600.[32] The word entered Spanish from the word chocol\xc4\x81tl in Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs. The origin of the Nahuatl word is uncertain, as it does not appear in any early Nahuatl source, where the word for chocolate drink is cacahuatl, ""cocoa water"". It is possible that the Spaniards coined the word (perhaps in order to avoid caca, a vulgar Spanish word for ""faeces"") by combining the Yucatec Mayan word chocol, ""hot"", with the Nahuatl word atl, ""water"". A widely-cited proposal is that the derives from unattested xocolatl meaning ""bitter drink"" is unsupported; the change from x- to ch- is unexplained, as is the -l-. Another proposed etymology derives it from the word chicolatl, meaning ""beaten drink"", which may derive from the word for the frothing stick, chicoli.[34] Other scholars reject all these proposals, considering the origin of first element of the name to be unknown.[35] The term ""chocolatier"", for a chocolate confection maker, is attested from 1888.[36]\n\nTypes\n\nChocolate is commonly used as a coating for various fruits such as cherries and/or fillings, such as liqueurs\n\nSeveral types of chocolate can be distinguished. Pure, unsweetened chocolate, often called ""baking chocolate"", contains primarily cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions. Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, which combines chocolate with sugar.\n\nMilk\n\nMilk chocolate is sweet chocolate that also contains milk powder or condensed milk. In the UK and Ireland, milk chocolate must contain a minimum of 20% total dry cocoa solids; in the rest of the European Union, the minimum is 25%.[37]\n\nWhite\n\nWhite chocolate\n\nWhite chocolate, although similar in texture to that of milk and dark chocolate, does not contain any cocoa solids that impart a dark color. In 2002, the US Food and Drug Administration established a standard for white chocolate as the ""common or usual name of products made from cocoa fat (i.e., cocoa butter), milk solids, nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners, and other safe and suitable ingredients, but containing no nonfat cocoa solids"".[38]\n\nDark\n\nDark chocolate is produced by adding fat and sugar to the cocoa mixture. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration calls this ""sweet chocolate"", and requires a 15% concentration of chocolate liquor. European rules specify a minimum of 35% cocoa solids.[37] A higher amount of cocoa solids indicates more bitterness. Semisweet chocolate is dark chocolate with low sugar content. Bittersweet chocolate is chocolate liquor to which some sugar (typically a third), more cocoa butter and vanilla are added.[39] It has less sugar and more liquor than semisweet chocolate, but the two are interchangeable in baking. It is also known to last for two years if stored properly. As of 2017 , there is no high-quality evidence that dark chocolate affects blood pressure significantly or provides other health benefits.[40]\n\nUnsweetened\n\nUnsweetened chocolate is pure chocolate liquor, also known as bitter or baking chocolate. It is unadulterated chocolate: the pure, ground, roasted chocolate beans impart a strong, deep chocolate flavor. It is typically used in baking or other products to which sugar and other ingredients are added. Raw chocolate, often referred to as raw cocoa, is always dark and a minimum of 75% cocoa.\n\nUnsweetened ""Baking"" Chocolate\n\nPoorly tempered or untempered chocolate may have whitish spots on the dark chocolate part, called chocolate bloom; it is an indication that sugar or fat has separated due to poor storage. It is not toxic and can be safely consumed.[41]\n\nProduction\n\nChocolate is created from the cocoa bean. A cacao tree with fruit pods in various stages of ripening.\n\nRoughly two-thirds of the entire world\'s cocoa is produced in West Africa, with 43% sourced from C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire,[42] where, as of 2007 , child labor is a common practice to obtain the product.[43][44] According to the World Cocoa Foundation, in 2007 some 50 million people around the world depended on cocoa as a source of livelihood.[45] As of 2007 in the UK, most chocolatiers purchase their chocolate from them, to melt, mold and package to their own design.[46] According to the WCF\'s 2012 report, the Ivory Coast is the largest producer of cocoa in the world.[47] The two main jobs associated with creating chocolate candy are chocolate makers and chocolatiers. Chocolate makers use harvested cocoa beans and other ingredients to produce couverture chocolate (covering). Chocolatiers use the finished couverture to make chocolate candies (bars, truffles, etc.).[48]\n\nProduction costs can be decreased by reducing cocoa solids content or by substituting cocoa butter with another fat. Cocoa growers object to allowing the resulting food to be called ""chocolate"", due to the risk of lower demand for their crops.[45]\n\nGenome\n\nThe sequencing in 2010 of the genome of the cacao tree may allow yields to be improved.[49] Due to concerns about global warming effects on lowland climate in the narrow band of latitudes where cocoa is grown (20 degrees north and south of the equator), the commercial company Mars, Incorporated and the University of California, Berkeley are conducting genomic research in 2017\xe2\x80\x9318 to improve the survivability of cacao plants in hot climates.[50]\n\nCacao varieties\n\nChocolate is made from cocoa beans, the dried and fermented seeds of the cacao tree (Theobroma cacao), a small, 4\xe2\x80\x938 m tall (15\xe2\x80\x9326 ft tall) evergreen tree native to the deep tropical region of the Americas. Recent genetic studies suggest the most common genotype of the plant originated in the Amazon basin and was gradually transported by humans throughout South and Central America. Early forms of another genotype have also been found in what is now Venezuela. The scientific name, Theobroma, means ""food of the gods"".[51] The fruit, called a cocoa pod, is ovoid, 15\xe2\x80\x9330 cm (6\xe2\x80\x9312 in) long and 8\xe2\x80\x9310 cm (3\xe2\x80\x934 in) wide, ripening yellow to orange, and weighing about 500 g (1.1 lb) when ripe.\n\nCacao trees are small, understory trees that need rich, well-drained soils. They naturally grow within 20\xc2\xb0 of either side of the equator because they need about 2000 mm of rainfall a year, and temperatures in the range of 21 to 32 \xc2\xb0C (70 to 90 \xc2\xb0F). Cacao trees cannot tolerate a temperature lower than 15 \xc2\xb0C (59 \xc2\xb0F).[52]\n\nThe three main varieties of cocoa beans used in chocolate are criollo, forastero, and trinitario.\n\nCriollo\n\nRepresenting only 5% of all cocoa beans grown as of 2008 ,[53] criollo is the rarest and most expensive cocoa on the market, and is native to Central America, the Caribbean islands and the northern tier of South American states.[54] The genetic purity of cocoas sold today as criollo is disputed, as most populations have been exposed to the genetic influence of other varieties.\n\nCriollos are particularly difficult to grow, as they are vulnerable to a variety of environmental threats and produce low yields of cocoa per tree. The flavor of criollo is described as delicate yet complex, low in classic chocolate flavor, but rich in ""secondary"" notes of long duration.[55]\n\nForastero\n\nThe most commonly grown bean is forastero,[53] a large group of wild and cultivated cocoas, most likely native to the Amazon basin. The African cocoa crop is entirely made up of forastero. They are significantly hardier and of higher yield than criollo. The source of most chocolate marketed,[53] forastero cocoas are typically strong in classic ""chocolate"" flavor, but have a short duration and are unsupported by secondary flavors, producing ""quite bland"" chocolate.[53]\n\nTrinitario\n\nTrinitario is a natural hybrid of criollo and forastero. Trinitario originated in Trinidad after an introduction of forastero to the local criollo crop. Nearly all cocoa produced over the past five decades is of the forastero or lower-grade trinitario varieties.[56]\n\nProcessing\n\nCocoa pods are harvested by cutting them from the tree using a machete, or by knocking them off the tree using a stick. The beans with their surrounding pulp are removed from the pods and placed in piles or bins, allowing access to micro-organisms so fermentation of the pectin-containing material can begin. Yeasts produce ethanol, lactic acid bacteria produce lactic acid, and acetic acid bacteria produce acetic acid. The fermentation process, which takes up to seven days, also produces several flavor precursors, eventually resulting in the familiar chocolate taste.[57]\n\nIt is important to harvest the pods when they are fully ripe, because if the pod is unripe, the beans will have a low cocoa butter content, or sugars in the white pulp will be insufficient for fermentation, resulting in a weak flavor. After fermentation, the beans must be quickly dried to prevent mold growth. Climate and weather permitting, this is done by spreading the beans out in the sun from five to seven days.[58]\n\nThe dried beans are then transported to a chocolate manufacturing facility. The beans are cleaned (removing twigs, stones, and other debris), roasted, and graded. Next, the shell of each bean is removed to extract the nib. Finally, the nibs are ground and liquefied, resulting in pure chocolate in fluid form: chocolate liquor.[59] The liquor can be further processed into two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter.[60]\n\nBlending\n\nChocolate liquor is blended with the cocoa butter in varying quantities to make different types of chocolate or couverture. The basic blends of ingredients for the various types of chocolate (in order of highest quantity of cocoa liquor first), are:\n\nFountain chocolate is made with high levels of cocoa butter, allowing it to flow gently over a chocolate fountain to serve as dessert fondue\n\nDark chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa liquor, and (sometimes) vanilla\n\nMilk chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa liquor, milk or milk powder, and vanilla\n\nWhite chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, milk or milk powder, and vanilla\n\nUsually, an emulsifying agent, such as soy lecithin, is added, though a few manufacturers prefer to exclude this ingredient for purity reasons and to remain GMO-free, sometimes at the cost of a perfectly smooth texture. Some manufacturers are now using PGPR, an artificial emulsifier derived from castor oil that allows them to reduce the amount of cocoa butter while maintaining the same mouthfeel.\n\nThe texture is also heavily influenced by processing, specifically conching (see below). The more expensive chocolate tends to be processed longer and thus has a smoother texture and mouthfeel, regardless of whether emulsifying agents are added.\n\nDifferent manufacturers develop their own ""signature"" blends based on the above formulas, but varying proportions of the different constituents are used. The finest, plain dark chocolate couverture contains at least 70% cocoa (both solids and butter), whereas milk chocolate usually contains up to 50%. High-quality white chocolate couverture contains only about 35% cocoa butter.\n\nProducers of high-quality, small-batch chocolate argue that mass production produces bad-quality chocolate.[53] Some mass-produced chocolate contains much less cocoa (as low as 7% in many cases), and fats other than cocoa butter. Vegetable oils and artificial vanilla flavor are often used in cheaper chocolate to mask poorly fermented and/or roasted beans.[53]\n\nIn 2007, the Chocolate Manufacturers Association in the United States, whose members include Hershey, Nestl\xc3\xa9, and Archer Daniels Midland, lobbied the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to change the legal definition of chocolate to let them substitute partially hydrogenated vegetable oils for cocoa butter, in addition to using artificial sweeteners and milk substitutes.[61] Currently, the FDA does not allow a product to be referred to as ""chocolate"" if the product contains any of these ingredients.[62][63]\n\nIn the EU a product can be sold as chocolate if it contains up to 5% vegetable oil, and must be labeled as ""family milk chocolate"" rather than ""milk chocolate"" if it contains 20% milk.[64]\n\nAccording to Canadian Food and Drug Regulations,[65] a ""chocolate product"" is a food product that is sourced from at least one ""cocoa product"" and contains at least one of the following: ""chocolate, bittersweet chocolate, semi-sweet chocolate, dark chocolate, sweet chocolate, milk chocolate, or white chocolate"". A ""cocoa product"" is defined as a food product that is sourced from cocoa beans and contains ""cocoa nibs, cocoa liquor, cocoa mass, unsweetened chocolate, bitter chocolate, chocolate liquor, cocoa, low-fat cocoa, cocoa powder, or low-fat cocoa powder"".\n\nConching\n\nChocolate melanger mixing raw ingredients\n\nThe penultimate process is called conching. A conche is a container filled with metal beads, which act as grinders. The refined and blended chocolate mass is kept in a liquid state by frictional heat. Chocolate before conching has an uneven and gritty texture. The conching process produces cocoa and sugar particles smaller than the tongue can detect (typically around 20 \xce\xbcm) and reduces rough edges, hence the smooth feel in the mouth. The length of the conching process determines the final smoothness and quality of the chocolate. High-quality chocolate is conched for about 72 hours, and lesser grades about four to six hours. After the process is complete, the chocolate mass is stored in tanks heated to about 45 to 50 \xc2\xb0C (113 to 122 \xc2\xb0F) until final processing.[66]\n\nTempering\n\nVideo of cocoa beans being ground and mixed with other ingredients to make chocolate at a Mayordomo store in Oaxaca\n\nThe final process is called tempering. Uncontrolled crystallization of cocoa butter typically results in crystals of varying size, some or all large enough to be seen with the naked eye. This causes the surface of the chocolate to appear mottled and matte, and causes the chocolate to crumble rather than snap when broken.[67][68] The uniform sheen and crisp bite of properly processed chocolate are the results of consistently small cocoa butter crystals produced by the tempering process.\n\nThe fats in cocoa butter can crystallize in six different forms (polymorphous crystallization).[67][69] The primary purpose of tempering is to assure that only the best form is present. The six different crystal forms have different properties.\n\nCrystal Melting temp. Notes I 17 \xc2\xb0C (63 \xc2\xb0F) Soft, crumbly, melts too easily II 21 \xc2\xb0C (70 \xc2\xb0F) Soft, crumbly, melts too easily III 26 \xc2\xb0C (79 \xc2\xb0F) Firm, poor snap, melts too easily IV 28 \xc2\xb0C (82 \xc2\xb0F) Firm, good snap, melts too easily V 34 \xc2\xb0C (93 \xc2\xb0F) Glossy, firm, best snap, melts near body temperature (37 \xc2\xb0C) VI 36 \xc2\xb0C (97 \xc2\xb0F) Hard, takes weeks to form\n\nMolten chocolate and a piece of a chocolate bar\n\nAs a solid piece of chocolate, the cocoa butter fat particles are in a crystalline rigid structure that gives the chocolate its solid appearance. Once heated, the crystals of the polymorphic cocoa butter can break apart from the rigid structure and allow the chocolate to obtain a more fluid consistency as the temperature increases \xe2\x80\x93 the melting process. When the heat is removed, the cocoa butter crystals become rigid again and come closer together, allowing the chocolate to solidify.[70]\n\nThe temperature in which the crystals obtain enough energy to break apart from their rigid conformation would depend on the milk fat content in the chocolate and the shape of the fat molecules, as well as the form of the cocoa butterfat. Chocolate with a higher fat content will melt at a lower temperature.[71]\n\nMaking chocolate considered ""good"" is about forming as many type V crystals as possible. This provides the best appearance and texture and creates the most stable crystals, so the texture and appearance will not degrade over time. To accomplish this, the temperature is carefully manipulated during the crystallization.\n\npistoles and callets Chocolate cubes,and\n\nGenerally, the chocolate is first heated to 45 \xc2\xb0C (113 \xc2\xb0F) to melt all six forms of crystals.[67][69] Next, the chocolate is cooled to about 27 \xc2\xb0C (81 \xc2\xb0F), which will allow crystal types IV and V to form. At this temperature, the chocolate is agitated to create many small crystal ""seeds"" which will serve as nuclei to create small crystals in the chocolate. The chocolate is then heated to about 31 \xc2\xb0C (88 \xc2\xb0F) to eliminate any type IV crystals, leaving just type V. After this point, any excessive heating of the chocolate will destroy the temper and this process will have to be repeated. Other methods of chocolate tempering are used as well. The most common variant is introducing already tempered, solid ""seed"" chocolate. The temper of chocolate can be measured with a chocolate temper meter to ensure accuracy and consistency. A sample cup is filled with the chocolate and placed in the unit which then displays or prints the results.\n\nTwo classic ways of manually tempering chocolate are:\n\nWorking the molten chocolate on a heat-absorbing surface, such as a stone slab, until thickening indicates the presence of sufficient crystal ""seeds""; the chocolate is then gently warmed to working temperature.\n\nStirring solid chocolate into molten chocolate to ""inoculate"" the liquid chocolate with crystals (this method uses the already formed crystals of the solid chocolate to ""seed"" the molten chocolate).\n\nChocolate tempering machines (or temperers) with computer controls can be used for producing consistently tempered chocolate. In particular, continuous tempering machines are used in large volume applications. Various methods and apparatuses for continuous flow tempering have been described by Aasted, Sollich and Buhler, three manufacturers of commercial chocolate equipment, with a focus now on energy efficiency. In general, molten chocolate coming in at 40\xe2\x80\x9350 \xc2\xb0C is cooled in heat exchangers to crystallization temperates of about 26\xe2\x80\x9330 \xc2\xb0C, passed through a tempering column consisting of spinning plates to induce shear, then warmed slightly to re-melt undesirable crystal formations.[72][73]\n\nShaping\n\nChocolate is molded in different shapes for different uses:[74]\n\nChocolate bars (tablets) are rectangular blocks of chocolate meant to be broken down to cubes (or other predefined shapes), which can then be used for consumption, cooking and baking. The term is also used for combination bars, which are a type of candy bars\n\nChocolate chips are small pieces of chocolate, usually drop-like, which are meant for decoration and baking\n\nPistoles , callets and f\xc3\xa8ves are small, coin-like or bean-like pieces of chocolate meant for baking and patisserie applications (also see Pistole (coin) and F\xc3\xa8ve (trinket))\n\n, and are small, coin-like or bean-like pieces of chocolate meant for baking and patisserie applications (also see Pistole (coin) and F\xc3\xa8ve (trinket)) Chocolate blocks are large, cuboid chunks of chocolate meant for professional use and further processing\n\nOther, more specialized shapes for chocolate include sticks, curls and hollow semi-spheres\n\nStorage\n\nChocolate is very sensitive to temperature and humidity. Ideal storage temperatures are between 15 and 17 \xc2\xb0C (59 and 63 \xc2\xb0F), with a relative humidity of less than 50%. If refrigerated or frozen without containment, chocolate can absorb enough moisture to cause a whitish discoloration, the result of fat or sugar crystals rising to the surface. Various types of ""blooming"" effects can occur if chocolate is stored or served improperly.[75]\n\nChocolate bloom is caused by storage temperature fluctuating or exceeding 24 \xc2\xb0C (75 \xc2\xb0F), while sugar bloom is caused by temperature below 15 \xc2\xb0C (59 \xc2\xb0F) or excess humidity. To distinguish between different types of bloom, one can rub the surface of the chocolate lightly, and if the bloom disappears, it is fat bloom. Moving chocolate between temperature extremes, can result in an oily texture. Although visually unappealing, chocolate suffering from bloom is safe for consumption and taste unaffected.[76][77][78] Bloom can be reversed by retempering the chocolate or using it for any use that requires melting the chocolate.[79]\n\nChocolate is generally stored away from other foods, as it can absorb different aromas. Ideally, chocolates are packed or wrapped, and placed in proper storage with the correct humidity and temperature. Additionally, chocolate is frequently stored in a dark place or protected from light by wrapping paper. The glossy shine, snap, aroma, texture, and taste of the chocolate can show the quality and if it was stored well.[80]\n\nComposition\n\nNutrition\n\nA 100-gram serving of milk chocolate supplies 540 calories. It is 59% carbohydrates (52% as sugar and 3% as dietary fiber), 30% fat and 8% protein (table). Approximately 65% of the fat in milk chocolate is saturated, mainly palmitic acid and stearic acid, while the predominant unsaturated fat is oleic acid (table).\n\n100-grams of milk chocolate is an excellent source (over 19% of the Daily Value, DV) of riboflavin, vitamin B12 and the dietary minerals, manganese, phosphorus and zinc. Chocolate is a good source (10\xe2\x80\x9319% DV) of calcium, magnesium and iron.\n\nEffects on health\n\nChocolate may be a factor for heartburn in some people because one of its constituents, theobromine, may affect the esophageal sphincter muscle in a way that permits stomach acids to enter the esophagus.[81] Theobromine poisoning is an overdosage reaction to the bitter alkaloid, which happens more frequently in domestic animals than humans. However, daily intake of 50\xe2\x80\x93100 g cocoa (0.8\xe2\x80\x931.5 g theobromine) by humans has been associated with sweating, trembling and severe headache.[82] Chocolate contains alkaloids such as theobromine and phenethylamine, which have physiological effects in humans, but the presence of theobromine renders it toxic to some animals, including dogs and cats.[83]\n\nAccording to a 2005 study, the average lead concentration of cocoa beans is \xe2\x89\xa4 0.5 ng/g, which is one of the lowest reported values for a natural food.[84] However, during cultivation and production, chocolate may absorb lead from the environment (such as in atmospheric emissions of leaded gasoline, which is still being used in Nigeria).[84] Reports from 2014 indicate that ""chocolate might be a significant source"" of lead ingestion for children if consumption is high (with dark chocolate containing higher amounts),[85][86] and ""one 10 g cube of dark chocolate may contain as much as 20% of the daily lead oral limit.""[85]\n\nChocolate and cocoa contain moderate to high amounts of oxalate,[87][88] which may increase the risk of kidney stones.[89]\n\nA few studies have documented allergic reactions from chocolate in children.[81] Other research has shown that dark chocolate can aggravate acne in men who are prone to it.[90] Research has also shown that consuming dark chocolate does not substantially affect blood pressure.[40] Chocolate and cocoa are under preliminary research to determine if consumption affects the risk of certain cardiovascular diseases[91] or cognitive abilities.[92]\n\nOne tablespoonful (5 grams) of dry unsweetened cocoa powder has 12.1 mg of caffeine[93] and a 25-g single serving of dark chocolate has 22.4 mg of caffeine.[94] Although a single 7 oz. serving of coffee may contain 80\xe2\x80\x93175 mg,[95] studies have shown psychoactive effects in caffeine doses as low as 9 mg,[96] and a dose as low as 12.5 mg was shown to have effects on cognitive performance.[97]\n\nExcessive consumption of large quantities of any energy-rich food, such as chocolate, without a corresponding increase in activity to expend the associated calories, can cause weight gain and possibly lead to obesity.[81] Raw chocolate is high in cocoa butter, a fat which is removed during chocolate refining and then added back in varying proportions during the manufacturing process. Manufacturers may add other fats, sugars, and milk, all of which increase the caloric content of chocolate.[81]\n\nPhytochemicals\n\nIn comparison to most foods, cocoa contains more phenolic antioxidants.[98] Cocoa solids are a source of flavonoids[99] and alkaloids, such as theobromine, phenethylamine, and caffeine.[100]\n\nLabeling\n\nSome manufacturers provide the percentage of chocolate in a finished chocolate confection as a label quoting percentage of ""cocoa"" or ""cacao"". This refers to the combined percentage of both cocoa solids and cocoa butter in the bar, not just the percentage of cocoa solids.[101] The Belgian AMBAO certification mark indicates that no non-cocoa vegetable fats have been used in making the chocolate.[102][103] A long-standing dispute between Britain on the one hand and Belgium and France over British use of vegetable fats in chocolate ended in 2000 with the adoption of new standards which permitted the use of up to five percent vegetable fats in clearly labelled products.[104] This British style of chocolate has sometimes been pejoratively referred to as ""vegelate"".[104]\n\nChocolates that are organic[105] or fair trade certified[106] carry labels accordingly.\n\nIn the United States, some large chocolate manufacturers lobbied the federal government to permit confections containing cheaper hydrogenated vegetable oil in place of cocoa butter to be sold as ""chocolate"". In June 2007, in response to consumer concern about the proposal, the FDA reiterated ""Cacao fat, as one of the signature characteristics of the product, will remain a principal component of standardized chocolate.""[107]\n\nIndustry\n\nChocolate, prevalent throughout the world, is a steadily growing, US$50 billion-a-year worldwide business.[108] Europe accounts for 45% of the world\'s chocolate revenue,[109] and the US spent $20 billion in 2013.[110] Big Chocolate is the grouping of major international chocolate companies in Europe and the U.S. U.S. companies Mars and Hershey\'s alone generated $13 billion a year in chocolate sales and account for two-thirds of U.S. production in 2004.[111] Despite the expanding reach of the chocolate industry internationally, cocoa farmers and labourers in the Ivory Coast are unaware of the uses of the beans; the high cost of chocolate products in the Ivory Coast make it inaccessible to the majority of the population, who do not know what it tastes like.[112]\n\nManufacturers\n\nChocolate with various fillings\n\nChocolate manufacturers produce a range of products from chocolate bars to fudge. Large manufacturers of chocolate products include Cadbury (the world\'s largest confectionery manufacturer), Ferrero, Guylian, The Hershey Company, Lindt & Spr\xc3\xbcngli, Mars, Incorporated, Milka, Neuhaus and Suchard.\n\nGuylian is best known for its chocolate sea shells; Cadbury for its Dairy Milk and Creme Egg. The Hershey Company, the largest chocolate manufacturer in North America, produces the Hershey Bar and Hershey\'s Kisses.[113] Mars Incorporated, a large privately owned U.S. corporation, produces Mars Bar, Milky Way, M&M\'s, Twix, and Snickers. Lindt is known for its truffle balls and gold foil-wrapped Easter bunnies.\n\nFood conglomerates Nestl\xc3\xa9 SA and Kraft Foods both have chocolate brands. Nestl\xc3\xa9 acquired Rowntree\'s in 1988 and now markets chocolates under their brand, including Smarties (a chocolate candy) and Kit Kat (a chocolate bar); Kraft Foods through its 1990 acquisition of Jacobs Suchard, now owns Milka and Suchard. In February 2010, Kraft also acquired British-based Cadbury;[114] Fry\'s, Trebor Basset and the fair trade brand Green & Black\'s also belongs to the group.\n\nChild labor in cocoa harvesting\n\nThe widespread use of children in cocoa production is controversial, not only for the concerns about child labor and exploitation, but also because up to 12,000 of the 200,000 children working in C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire, the world\'s biggest producer of cocoa,[115] may be victims of trafficking or slavery.[116] Most attention on this subject has focused on West Africa, which collectively supplies 69 percent of the world\'s cocoa, and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire in particular, which supplies 35 percent of the world\'s cocoa. Thirty percent of children under age 15 in sub-Saharan Africa are child laborers, mostly in agricultural activities including cocoa farming.[118] Major chocolate producers, such as Nestl\xc3\xa9, buy cocoa at commodities exchanges where Ivorian cocoa is mixed with other cocoa.[119]\n\nIn 2009, Salvation Army International Development (SAID) UK stated that 12,000 children have been trafficked on cocoa farms in the Ivory Coast of Africa, where half of the world\'s chocolate is made.[120] SAID UK states that it is these child slaves who are likely to be working in ""harsh and abusive""[121] conditions for the production of chocolate,[120] and an increasing number of health-food[122] and anti-slavery[123] organisations are highlighting and campaigning against the use of trafficking in the chocolate industry.\n\nAs of 2017, approximately 2.1 million children in Ghana and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire were involved in farming cocoa, carrying heavy loads, clearing forests, and being exposed to pesticides.[5] According to Sona Ebai, the former secretary-general of the Alliance of Cocoa Producing Countries: ""I think child labor cannot be just the responsibility of industry to solve. I think it\'s the proverbial all-hands-on-deck: government, civil society, the private sector. And there, you need leadership.""[116] Reported in 2018, a 3-year pilot program \xe2\x80\x93 conducted by Nestl\xc3\xa9 with 26,000 farmers mostly located in C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire \xe2\x80\x93 observed a 51% decrease in the number of children doing hazardous jobs in cocoa farming.[4] The US Department of Labor formed the Child Labor Cocoa Coordinating Group as a public-private partnership with the governments of Ghana and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire to address child labor practices in the cocoa industry.[124] The International Cocoa Initiative involving major cocoa manufacturers established the Child Labor Monitoring and Remediation System intended to monitor thousands of farms in Ghana and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire for child labor conditions,[4][5] but the program reached less than 20% of the child laborers.[125] Despite these efforts, goals to reduce child labor in West Africa by 70% before 2020 are frustrated by persistent poverty, absence of schools, expansion of cocoa farmland, and increased demand for cocoa.[4][126]\n\nIn April 2018, the Cocoa Barometer report stated: ""Not a single company or government is anywhere near reaching the sector-wide objective of the elimination of child labor, and not even near their commitments of a 70% reduction of child labor by 2020"".[126]\n\nFair trade\n\nIn the 2000s, some chocolate producers began to engage in fair trade initiatives, to address concerns about the marginalization of cocoa laborers in developing countries. Traditionally, Africa and other developing countries received low prices for their exported commodities such as cocoa, which caused poverty to abound. Fairtrade seeks to establish a system of direct trade from developing countries to counteract this unfair system.[127] One solution for fair labor practices is for farmers to become part of an Agricultural cooperative. Cooperatives pay farmers a fair price for their cocoa so farmers have enough money for food, clothes, and school fees.[128] One of the main tenets of fair trade is that farmers receive a fair price, but this does not mean that the larger amount of money paid for fair trade cocoa goes directly to the farmers. The effectiveness of fair trade has been questioned. In a 2014 article, The Economist stated that workers on fair trade farms have a lower standard of living than on similar farms outside the fair trade system.[129]\n\nUsage and consumption\n\ns\'more topped with melted chocolate from a chocolate bar\n\nChocolate cake with chocolate frosting\n\nBars\n\nChocolate is sold in chocolate bars, which come in dark chocolate, milk chocolate and white chocolate varieties. Some bars that are mostly chocolate have other ingredients blended into the chocolate, such as nuts, raisins, or crisped rice. Chocolate is used as an ingredient in a huge variety of bars, which typically contain various confectionary ingredients (e.g., nougat, wafers, caramel, nuts, etc.) which are coated in chocolate.\n\nCoating and filling\n\nChocolate is used as a flavouring product in many desserts, such as chocolate cakes, chocolate brownies, chocolate mousse and chocolate chip cookies. Numerous types of candy and snacks contain chocolate, either as a filling (e.g., M&M\'s) or as a coating (e.g., chocolate-coated raisins or chocolate-coated peanuts).\n\nBeverages\n\nSome non-alcoholic beverages contain chocolate, such as chocolate milk, hot chocolate, chocolate milkshakes and tejate. Some alcoholic liqueurs are flavoured with chocolate, such as chocolate liqueur and creme de cacao. Chocolate is a popular flavour of ice cream and pudding, and chocolate sauce is a commonly added as a topping on ice cream sundaes. The caff\xc3\xa8 mocha is an espresso beverage containing chocolate.\n\nSee also\n\nReferences'";"Other";"1.txt-Other"

"1009.txt";"b'2013 single by Pharrell Williams\n\n2013 single by Pharrell Williams\n\n""Happy"" is a song written, produced, and performed by American singer Pharrell Williams, released as the first and only single from the soundtrack album for the film Despicable Me 2 (2013). The song was first released on November 21, 2013, alongside a long-form music video. The song was reissued on December 16, 2013, by Back Lot Music under exclusive license to Columbia Records, a division of Sony Music.[1] The song also served as the lead single from Williams\' second studio album, Girl (2014).\n\n""Happy"" is an uptempo soul and neo soul song on which Williams\'s falsetto voice has been compared to Curtis Mayfield\'s by critics. The song has been highly successful, peaking at No. 1 in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and 19 other countries. It was the best-selling song of 2014 in the United States with 6.45 million copies sold for the year,[3] as well as in the United Kingdom with 1.5 million copies sold for the year.[4] It reached No. 1 in the UK on a record-setting three occasions and became the most downloaded song of all time in the UK in September 2014;[5] it is the eighth-highest-selling single of all time in the country.[6] It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song. A live rendition of the song won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards.\n\nThe music video for ""Happy"" was nominated for Best Male Video and Video of the Year at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards. It also won the Grammy Award for Best Music Video at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards.[7][8] The song was Billboard\'s number-one single for 2014.\n\n""Happy"" was the most successful song of 2014, with 13.9 million units (sales plus equivalent streams) worldwide.[9]\n\nBackground [ edit ]\n\nWilliams provided vocals for French duo Daft Punk\'s 2013 album Random Access Memories, on the songs ""Lose Yourself to Dance"" and ""Get Lucky"". After returning from the recording sessions in Paris, he attended a meeting with record label managers who said that the results were ""spectacular"" and that ""Get Lucky"" would be Daft Punk\'s next single. They also made Williams an offer to record his own album, to which he agreed quickly, ""overwhelmed that someone wanted to know what\'s in my heart"".[10]\n\nOn December 17, 2013, it was announced that Williams had signed to Columbia Records and would release his second studio album in 2014.[11] In a December 2013 press release, Rob Stringer, Chairman of Columbia Records, said ""When we excitedly partnered with Pharrell in January of this year, we felt it was his time again. Since then, \'Blurred Lines\' and \'Get Lucky\' have defined pop music in 2013, and now we are preparing to launch Pharrell as a global solo superstar in 2014. \'Happy\' is just the beginning.""[11]\n\nWilliams originally wrote the song for CeeLo Green and felt Green\'s recording of the song was better, but Elektra Records, Green\'s record label, decided against it since he was on the verge of releasing his Christmas album, Cee Lo\'s Magic Moment.[12][13][14][15]\n\nComposition [ edit ]\n\n""Happy"" was written and produced by Williams, with backing vocals by Rhea Dummett, Trevon Henderson, Ashley L. Lee, Shamika Hightower, Jasmine Murray and Terrence Rolle.[16] The track was digitally edited and arranged by Andrew Coleman and Mike Larson, who also recorded it with assistance from Matthew Desrameaux at Circle House Studios in Miami, Florida. The song was later mixed by Leslie Brathwaite at Music Box Studios in Atlanta, Georgia.[16]\n\n""Happy"" plays for 3 minutes and 53 seconds[1] in common time and at a tempo of 156 beats per minute. The song is written in the key of F minor.[17] Williams sings the upper notes in falsetto; his vocal range spans from F 3 to C 5 .[17] His singing on the track has been compared to that of Curtis Mayfield.[18][19]\n\n""Happy"" is a mid-tempo soul and neo soul song.[20][21] According to music journalist Paul Tingen, ""Happy"" is ""a mid-tempo ... song in a faux-Motown style, with an arrangement that is, by modern standards, very sparse: programmed drums, one bass and one keyboard part, and handclaps both programmed and played, all topped off by Williams\'s lead vocals and a whole posse of backing vocals"".[20] Jody Rosen viewed the song as a ""standout"" with a ""sprightly neosoul funk groove"".[18]\n\nCritical reception [ edit ]\n\nJody Rosen of Rolling Stone gave it 3.5 stars and deemed it ""an instant contender for 2013\'s Song of the Summer"".[18] In a 4/5 review, Renowned for Sound\'s Huw Woodward said, ""Happy is a rather\xe2\x80\xa6 well\xe2\x80\xa6 happy affair with a cheerful beat and exuberant vocal that would indicate that the former N.E.R.D singer is finding a lot of lighthearted fun to be had in both music and life. \'Because I\'m happy, clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth\' sings Williams as the jaunty rhythm gets your head nodding.""[23] Holly Williams of Contactmusic.com gave it four stars, praising it for being ""unbelievably catchy"" and ""the kind of song that makes you want to dance and sing along"".[22]\n\nAccolades [ edit ]\n\nThe song was nominated for Best Original Song at the 86th Academy Awards on March 2, 2014, but lost to ""Let It Go"" from Frozen.[24] When GQ magazine asked Williams ""how badly"" he wanted the Oscar, he responded: ""When they read the results, my face was...frozen. But then I thought about it, and I just decided just to... let it go.""[25]\n\nIn January 2015, ""Happy"" was ranked at No. 13 on The Village Voice\'s annual year-end Pazz & Jop critics\' poll.[26]\n\n""I like that song \'Happy\'\xe2\x80\xa6"" remarked Phil Collins. ""It\'s a great groove, and he\'s a very smart guy.""[27]\n\nChart performance [ edit ]\n\nNetherlands [ edit ]\n\nIn October 2013, a month prior to its release, ""Happy"" catapulted to No. 1 on the Dutch Top 40 chart in the Netherlands, partially as a result of radio station 3FM airplay and subsequent online downloads, as well as featuring in a Transavia commercial.[28] It was released worldwide on November 21, 2013. In 2014, after 35 weeks on the charts and then still in the top 15, ""Happy"" became the most successful song in the Dutch Top 40 of all time.[29][30]\n\nUnited Kingdom [ edit ]\n\nIn the United Kingdom, ""Happy"" debuted at No. 71 on the UK Singles Chart on December 1, 2013.[31] It then spent four weeks climbing before finally reaching No. 1 on December 29.[32] It became Williams\' third No. 1 song in Britain, counting ""Get Lucky"" and ""Blurred Lines"", where he appeared as a featured artist.[33] It has since spent four non-consecutive weeks at No. 1, reaching the peak on three separate occasions. In doing so, Williams became only the third artist ever to achieve this, and the first since Guy Mitchell in 1957 with ""Singing the Blues"".[34] Following the single\'s third week at No. 1, it spent five weeks in the top three before returning to the summit, boosted by his performance at the 2014 Brit Awards.[34] In the same week that ""Happy"" returned to No. 1 for the third time, it sold its millionth copy in the UK, Williams\' third in under a year, having previously done so with Daft Punk\'s ""Get Lucky"" in June 2013, and Thicke\'s ""Blurred Lines"" in July 2013. This made Williams only the second artist in UK chart history (the first being The Beatles) to have three singles sell 1 million copies in under a year,[34] as well as only the third artist ever to have three million-sellers, along with The Beatles (who have six) and Rihanna (who has four).[34]\n\n""Happy"" was the best-selling single of UK in 2014, with 1.5 million copies sold for the year,[4] and became the most downloaded song of all time in the UK by September 2014, with over 1.62 million sold.[35] It had also been streamed over 25 million times and was the first song released in the 2010s to go 3\xc3\x97 Platinum.[36] With the inclusion of streaming, ""Happy"" has achieved combined sales of over 2 million.[37] Additionally, ""Happy"" and Idina Menzel\'s ""Let It Go"" became the first singles ever to spend an entire calendar year on the official UK top 75 chart. On June 12, it was announced that ""Happy"" had overtaken ""Evergreen"" by Will Young as the UK\'s best-selling single of the 21st century, with sales of 1.81 million.[35] ""Happy"" spent 92 weeks in the UK top 100.[38] As of September 2017 , the song has sold 1,922,000 copies, which gives a total of 2,630,000 combined units when 70 million streams are included.[6]\n\nNew Zealand [ edit ]\n\nOn the New Zealand Singles Chart, ""Happy"" debuted at No. 11 on December 23, 2013. The next week it moved to No. 2. Then on January 6, 2014, ""Happy"" began a 12-week consecutive reign in the No. 1 position, right up until March 24, 2014. It then dropped to No. 2 for one week, then spent a further three weeks at No. 1, bringing the total number of weeks at No. 1 to fifteen, breaking the 36-year-long record for most weeks spent at No. 1, previously held by Boney M.\'s ""Rivers of Babylon"".[39][40] As of February 22, 2015 , ""Happy"" had spent 62 straight weeks in the New Zealand Top 40 since its debut, before finally dropping out of the chart the following week. The song has been certified 6\xc3\x97 Platinum in New Zealand.[39][41]\n\nUnited States [ edit ]\n\n""Happy"" reached the top of the US Billboard Hot 100 for the week ending March 8, 2014, giving Williams his fourth No. 1 single on the chart, but his first as lead artist. It took twelve years and a week (as the issue date is March 8, 2014) to achieve his first Hot 100 No. 1 hit as a lead artist.[42] The song remained at No. 1 the following week, and also topped the Hot 100 Airplay chart.[43] The song also holds the record for the second-highest audience peak for a week on the Hot 100 Airplay, with 225.9 million impressions while Robin Thicke\'s ""Blurred Lines"", a song in which Pharrell was featured as well as produced and co-wrote, holds the all-time record.[44] The song remained at the No. 1 position longer than any other song in the calendar year. The single passed its 4 million sales mark in April 2014, the first song of 2014 to do so.[45]\n\nOn the week of May 17, 2014, after spending ten weeks at the summit, ""Happy"" was finally knocked off number one by John Legend\'s ""All of Me"" down to the No. 2 spot.[46] ""Happy"" became the 28th song in the history of the chart to reach this milestone.[47] It spent a total of 22 weeks in the top 10, entering on the week-ending February 15, 2014 and departing on July 19, 2014. The song sold 5,633,000 copies in the US in the first six months of 2014, the most ever of any song in the first six months of any calendar year.[48] It was also the best-selling song of 2014 in the US with 6.45 million copies sold for the year,[3] and has sold over 6.9 million total copies in the US as of April 2015 .[49]\n\nOther charts [ edit ]\n\nThe song also topped the charts of 22 other countries, including Australia, Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Poland and Spain. It has spent twelve weeks (including seven consecutive) at No. 1 in Ireland,[50] making it the third song in less than a year to spend more than seven weeks at No. 1, after Robin Thicke\'s ""Blurred Lines"" and Avicii\'s ""Wake Me Up!"". In France, ""Happy"" spent 22 weeks at No. 1, the longest reign at the top of the Syndicat National de l\'Edition Phonographique, beating Lou Bega\'s ""Mambo No. 5"", which spent 20 weeks at No. 1 in 1999.\n\nMusic video [ edit ]\n\nTo coincide with the single release, the website 24hoursofhappy.com was launched. It features a visual presentation of ""Happy"" advertised as being ""the world\'s first 24-hour music video."" The video was directed by the French directing team We Are from LA[51] with creative director Yoann Lemoine,[52] and shot by steadicam operator Jon Beattie.[53] It consists of the four-minute song repeated multiple times, with various people dancing around Los Angeles and miming along. The website allows users to navigate to various points in the 24-hour timeframe, including all 360 four-minute segments.[54]\n\nWilliams himself appears 24 times in the day-long video, once at the start of each hour. There are a number of celebrity cameos in the video, including Tyler, the Creator, Earl Sweatshirt, Whit Hertford, Kelly Osbourne, Rob Zabrecky, Magic Johnson, Urijah Faber, S\xc3\xa9rgio Mendes, Jimmy Kimmel, Odd Future, Steve Carell (voice of Gru in the Despicable Me films), Jamie Foxx, Ana Ortiz, Miranda Cosgrove (voice of Margo in the films), Kazuchika Okada, Shinsuke Nakamura, Gavin DeGraw, Leah LaBelle and JoJo.[55] The minions from the Despicable Me series make several appearances throughout the film, including one scene at 3:00 am, in which Pharrell Williams and the minions dance in a movie theatre that is playing the scene from Despicable Me 2 in which ""Happy"" appears. A person in a one-eyed minion costume dances to the entire song at 4:40 pm.\n\nAn official four-minute edit of the video was also released onto YouTube on November 21, 2013, and as of March 2018 has had over 1 billion views.[56] It was nominated for Best Male Video and Video of the Year at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards.[7][8] The 24-hour music video for ""Happy"" was also projected at the Buenos Aires International Festival of Independent Cinema in April 2014.[57]\n\n""Happy"" tribute videos [ edit ]\n\nThe original video spawned many cover videos on YouTube in which people from different cities throughout the world dance to the song. Those videos are usually called ""Pharrell Williams \xe2\x80\x93 Happy \xe2\x80\x93 We Are from [name of the city]"".[58] As of May 2014 , more than 1,500 videos have been created. Inspired by this global phenomenon, a French couple launched a website wearehappyfrom.com to showcase the remakes.[59]\n\nIn April 2014, the Embassy of the United States, Yerevan, Armenia released a video titled ""Happy Yerevan"", directed by Artyom Abovyan featuring US ambassador John A. Heffern and several Armenian celebrities, such as singers Andr\xc3\xa9, Emmy and Aram Mp3.[60][61] The same month artsmedia Albania produced a music video for the track featuring inhabitants of Tirana. The video soon became popular in Albania and caused controversy over the usage of images of Albanian First Secretary Enver Hoxha.[62]\n\nArrests in Iran for tribute [ edit ]\n\nIn May 2014, a group of Iranian fans who created a tribute to ""Happy"" were arrested.[63][64][65][66] According to a police chief, the song represented vulgarity and also hurt public chastity. Williams responded to the arrest in a tweet stating ""It\'s beyond sad these kids were arrested for trying to spread happiness.""[67] Soon after Iran\'s President Hassan Rouhani criticized the arrest when he tweeted ""#Happiness is our people\'s right. We shouldn\'t be too hard on behaviours caused by joy.""[68] The dancers, along with the director,[69] were later released. It was reported on September 19, 2014, that seven of the individuals in the Iranian video had been handed sentences, suspended for three years, of 91 lashes each along with jail by Iranian courts.[70]\n\n""Weird Al"" Yankovic parody [ edit ]\n\nIn 2014, American musician ""Weird Al"" Yankovic parodied ""Happy"" as ""Tacky"" on his fourteenth studio album Mandatory Fun. The song mocks questionable style in fashion as well as activities considered gauche. Yankovic recorded the song as one of the last on Mandatory Fun, and received Williams\' approval directly, through email. He remarked he was ""honored"" to have his work spoofed by Yankovic.[71] The song\'s one-shot music video parodies ""Happy"", and was the first in a series of eight videos released over eight days in promotion of Mandatory Fun. It features cameo appearances by Aisha Tyler, Margaret Cho, Eric Stonestreet, Kristen Schaal, and Jack Black, and was produced by Nerdist Industries.[72][73]\n\nCredits and personnel [ edit ]\n\nRecording[2]\n\nRecorded at Circle House Studios, Miami, Florida\n\nMixed at Music Box Studios, Atlanta, Georgia\n\nPersonnel[2]\n\nPharrell Williams \xe2\x80\x93 lead vocals, keyboards, drums, bass guitar, writing, production\n\nRhea Dummett \xe2\x80\x93 backing vocals\n\nTrevon Henderson \xe2\x80\x93 backing vocals\n\nAshley L.

"102.txt";"b'Food produced from the seed of Theobroma cacao\n\nChocolate is a food product made from roasted and ground cacao pods, that is available as a liquid, solid or paste, on its own or as a flavoring agent in other foods. Cacao has been consumed in some form since at least the Olmec civilization (19th-11th century BCE),[1][2] and the majority of Mesoamerican people - including the Maya and Aztecs - made chocolate beverages.[3]\n\nThe seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor. After fermentation, the beans are dried, cleaned, and roasted. The shell is removed to produce cocoa nibs, which are then ground to cocoa mass, unadulterated chocolate in rough form. Once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating, it is called chocolate liquor. The liquor may also be cooled and processed into its two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter. Baking chocolate, also called bitter chocolate, contains cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions, without any added sugar. Powdered baking cocoa, which contains more fiber than cocoa butter, can be processed with alkali to produce dutch cocoa. Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, a combination of cocoa solids, cocoa butter or added vegetable oils, and sugar. Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder or condensed milk. White chocolate contains cocoa butter, sugar, and milk, but no cocoa solids.\n\nChocolate is one of the most popular food types and flavors in the world, and many foodstuffs involving chocolate exist, particularly desserts, including cakes, pudding, mousse, chocolate brownies, and chocolate chip cookies. Many candies are filled with or coated with sweetened chocolate. Chocolate bars, either made of solid chocolate or other ingredients coated in chocolate, are eaten as snacks. Gifts of chocolate molded into different shapes (such as eggs, hearts, coins) are traditional on certain Western holidays, including Christmas, Easter, Valentine\'s Day, and Hanukkah. Chocolate is also used in cold and hot beverages, such as chocolate milk and hot chocolate, and in some alcoholic drinks, such as creme de cacao.\n\nAlthough cocoa originated in the Americas, West African countries, particularly C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire and Ghana, are the leading producers of cocoa in the 21st century, accounting for some 60% of the world cocoa supply.\n\nWith some two million children involved in the farming of cocoa in West Africa, child slavery and trafficking were major concerns in 2018,[4][5] and continue to be. International attempts to improve conditions for children were doomed to failure because of persistent poverty, absence of schools, increasing world cocoa demand, more intensive farming of cocoa, and continued exploitation of child labor.[4]\n\nHistory\n\nMesoamerican usage\n\nTwo Mayans sit around a container of frothed chocolate.\n\nChocolate has been prepared as a drink for nearly all of its history. For example, one vessel found at an Olmec archaeological site on the Gulf Coast of Veracruz, Mexico, dates chocolate\'s preparation by pre-Olmec peoples as early as 1750 BC.[6] On the Pacific coast of Chiapas, Mexico, a Mokaya archaeological site provides evidence of cocoa beverages dating even earlier, to 1900 BC.[7][6] The residues and the kind of vessel in which they were found indicate the initial use of cocoa was not simply as a beverage, but the white pulp around the cocoa beans was likely used as a source of fermentable sugars for an alcoholic drink.[8]\n\nMan Carrying a Cacao Pod, 1440\xe2\x80\x931521. Volcanic stone, traces of red pigment. Aztec., 1440\xe2\x80\x931521. Volcanic stone, traces of red pigment. Brooklyn Museum\n\nAn early Classic-period (460\xe2\x80\x93480 AD) Mayan tomb from the site in Rio Azul had vessels with the Maya glyph for cocoa on them with residue of a chocolate drink, suggests the Maya were drinking chocolate around 400 AD.[9] Documents in Maya hieroglyphs stated chocolate was used for ceremonial purposes, in addition to everyday life.[10] The Maya grew cacao trees in their backyards,[11] and used the cocoa seeds the trees produced to make a frothy, bitter drink.[12]\n\nBy the 15th century, the Aztecs gained control of a large part of Mesoamerica and adopted cocoa into their culture. They associated chocolate with Quetzalcoatl, who, according to one legend, was cast away by the other gods for sharing chocolate with humans,[13] and identified its extrication from the pod with the removal of the human heart in sacrifice.[14] In contrast to the Maya, who liked their chocolate warm, the Aztecs drank it cold, seasoning it with a broad variety of additives, including the petals of the Cymbopetalum penduliflorum tree, chile pepper, allspice, vanilla, and honey.\n\nThe Aztecs were unable to grow cocoa themselves, as their home in the Mexican highlands was unsuitable for it, so chocolate was a luxury imported into the empire.[13] Those who lived in areas ruled by the Aztecs were required to offer cocoa seeds in payment of the tax they deemed ""tribute"".[13] Cocoa beans were often used as currency.[15] For example, the Aztecs used a system in which one turkey cost 100 cocoa beans and one fresh avocado was worth three beans.[16]\n\nThe Maya and Aztecs associated cocoa with human sacrifice, and chocolate drinks specifically with sacrificial human blood. The Spanish royal chronicler Gonzalo Fern\xc3\xa1ndez de Oviedo y Vald\xc3\xa9s described a chocolate drink he had seen in Nicaragua in 1528, mixed with achiote: ""because those people are fond of drinking human blood, to make this beverage seem like blood, they add a little achiote, so that it then turns red. ... and part of that foam is left on the lips and around the mouth, and when it is red for having achiote, it seems a horrific thing, because it seems like blood itself.""\n\nEuropean adaptation\n\nThe morning chocolate by Chocolate soon became a fashionable drink of the European nobility after the discovery of the Americas.by Pietro Longhi ; Venice, 1775\xe2\x80\x931780\n\nUntil the 16th century, no European had ever heard of the popular drink from the Central American peoples.[13] Christopher Columbus and his son Ferdinand encountered the cocoa bean on Columbus\'s fourth mission to the Americas on 15 August 1502, when he and his crew seized a large native canoe that proved to contain cocoa beans among other goods for trade.[19] Spanish conquistador Hern\xc3\xa1n Cort\xc3\xa9s may have been the first European to encounter it, as the frothy drink was part of the after-dinner routine of Montezuma.[9][20] Jos\xc3\xa9 de Acosta, a Spanish Jesuit missionary who lived in Peru and then Mexico in the later 16th century, wrote of its growing influence on the Spaniards:\n\nAlthough bananas are more profitable, cocoa is more highly esteemed in Mexico. . . Cocoa is a smaller fruit than almonds and thicker, which toasted do not taste bad. It is so prized among the Indians and even among Spaniards. . . because since it is a dried fruit it can be stored for a long time without deterioration, and they brings ships loaded with them from the province of Guatemala. . . It also serves as currency, because with five cocoas you can buy one thing, with thirty another, and with a hundred something else, without there being contradiction; and they give these cocoas as alms to the poor who beg for them. The principal product of this cocoa is a concoction which they make that they call \xe2\x80\x9cchocolate,\xe2\x80\x9d which is a crazy thing treasured in that land, and those who are not accustomed are disgusted by it, because it has a foam on top and a bubbling like that of feces, which certainly takes a lot to put up with. Anyway, it is the prized beverage which the Indians offer to nobles who come to or pass through their lands; and the Spaniards, especially Spanish women born in those lands die for black chocolate. This aforementioned chocolate is said to the be made in various forms and temperaments, hot, cold, and lukewarm. They are wont to use spices and much chili; they also make it into a paste, and it is said that it is a medicine to treat coughs, the stomach, and colds. Whatever may be the case, in fact those who have not been reared on this opinion are not appetized by it.[21]\n\n""Trait\xc3\xa9s nouveaux & curieux du caf\xc3\xa9 du th\xc3\xa9 et du chocolate"", by Philippe Sylvestre Dufour, 1685 , by Philippe Sylvestre Dufour, 1685\n\nWhile Columbus had taken cocoa beans with him back to Spain,[19] chocolate made no impact until Spanish friars introduced it to the Spanish court.[13] After the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs, chocolate was imported to Europe. There, it quickly became a court favorite. It was still served as a beverage, but the Spanish added sugar, as well as honey (the original sweetener used by the Aztecs for chocolate), to counteract the natural bitterness.[22] Vanilla, another indigenous American introduction, was also a popular additive, with pepper and other spices sometimes used to give the illusion of a more potent vanilla flavor. Unfortunately, these spices tended to unsettle the European constitution; the Encyclop\xc3\xa9die states, ""The pleasant scent and sublime taste it imparts to chocolate have made it highly recommended; but a long experience having shown that it could potentially upset one\'s stomach"", which is why chocolate without vanilla was sometimes referred to as ""healthy chocolate"".[23] By 1602, chocolate had made its way from Spain to Austria.[24] By 1662, Pope Alexander VII had declared that religious fasts were not broken by consuming chocolate drinks. Within about a hundred years, chocolate established a foothold throughout Europe.[13]\n\nmoulinet or swizzle stick, London 1714\xe2\x80\x9315 ( Silver chocolate pot with hinged finial to insert aor swizzle stick, London 1714\xe2\x80\x9315 ( Victoria and Albert Museum\n\nThe new craze for chocolate brought with it a thriving slave market, as between the early 1600s and late 1800s, the laborious and slow processing of the cocoa bean was manual.[13] Cocoa plantations spread, as the English, Dutch, and French colonized and planted. With the depletion of Mesoamerican workers, largely to disease, cocoa production was often the work of poor wage laborers and African slaves. Wind-powered and horse-drawn mills were used to speed production, augmenting human labor. Heating the working areas of the table-mill, an innovation that emerged in France in 1732, also assisted in extraction.[25]\n\nNew processes that sped the production of chocolate emerged early in the Industrial Revolution. In 1815, Dutch chemist Coenraad van Houten introduced alkaline salts to chocolate, which reduced its bitterness.[13] A few years thereafter, in 1828, he created a press to remove about half the natural fat (cocoa butter or cocoa butter) from chocolate liquor, which made chocolate both cheaper to produce and more consistent in quality. This innovation introduced the modern era of chocolate.[19]\n\nKnown as ""Dutch cocoa"", this machine-pressed chocolate was instrumental in the transformation of chocolate to its solid form when, in 1847, English chocolatier Joseph Fry discovered a way to make chocolate moldable when he mixed the ingredients of cocoa powder and sugar with melted cocoa butter.[22] Subsequently, his chocolate factory, Fry\'s of Bristol, England, began mass-producing chocolate bars, Fry\'s Chocolate Cream, launched in 1866, and they became very popular.[26] Milk had sometimes been used as an addition to chocolate beverages since the mid-17th century, but in 1875 Swiss chocolatier Daniel Peter invented milk chocolate by mixing a powdered milk developed by Henri Nestl\xc3\xa9 with the liquor.[13][19] In 1879, the texture and taste of chocolate was further improved when Rudolphe Lindt invented the conching machine.[27]\n\nBesides Nestl\xc3\xa9, several notable chocolate companies had their start in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Rowntree\'s of York set up and began producing chocolate in 1862, after buying out the Tuke family business. Cadbury was manufacturing boxed chocolates in England by 1868.[13] Manufacturing their first Easter egg in 1875, Cadbury created the modern chocolate Easter egg after developing a pure cocoa butter that could easily be molded into smooth shapes.[28] In 1893, Milton S. Hershey purchased chocolate processing equipment at the World\'s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, and soon began the career of Hershey\'s chocolates with chocolate-coated caramels.\n\nIntroduction to the United States\n\nThe Baker Chocolate Company, which makes Baker\'s Chocolate, is the oldest producer of chocolate in the United States. In 1765 Dr. James Baker and John Hannon founded the company in Boston. Using cocoa beans from the West Indies, the pair built their chocolate business, which is still in operation.[29][30]\n\nWhite chocolate was first introduced to the U.S. in 1946 by Frederick E. Hebert of Hebert Candies in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, near Boston, after he had tasted ""white coat"" candies while traveling in Europe.[31][30]\n\nEtymology\n\nCocoa, pronounced by the Olmecs as kakawa,[1] dates to 1000 BC or earlier.[1] The word ""chocolate"" entered the English language from Spanish in about 1600.[32] The word entered Spanish from the word chocol\xc4\x81tl in Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs. The origin of the Nahuatl word is uncertain, as it does not appear in any early Nahuatl source, where the word for chocolate drink is cacahuatl, ""cocoa water"". It is possible that the Spaniards coined the word (perhaps in order to avoid caca, a vulgar Spanish word for ""faeces"") by combining the Yucatec Mayan word chocol, ""hot"", with the Nahuatl word atl, ""water"". A widely-cited proposal is that the derives from unattested xocolatl meaning ""bitter drink"" is unsupported; the change from x- to ch- is unexplained, as is the -l-. Another proposed etymology derives it from the word chicolatl, meaning ""beaten drink"", which may derive from the word for the frothing stick, chicoli.[34] Other scholars reject all these proposals, considering the origin of first element of the name to be unknown.[35] The term ""chocolatier"", for a chocolate confection maker, is attested from 1888.[36]\n\nTypes\n\nChocolate is commonly used as a coating for various fruits such as cherries and/or fillings, such as liqueurs\n\nSeveral types of chocolate can be distinguished. Pure, unsweetened chocolate, often called ""baking chocolate"", contains primarily cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions. Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, which combines chocolate with sugar.\n\nMilk\n\nMilk chocolate is sweet chocolate that also contains milk powder or condensed milk. In the UK and Ireland, milk chocolate must contain a minimum of 20% total dry cocoa solids; in the rest of the European Union, the minimum is 25%.[37]\n\nWhite\n\nWhite chocolate\n\nWhite chocolate, although similar in texture to that of milk and dark chocolate, does not contain any cocoa solids that impart a dark color. In 2002, the US Food and Drug Administration established a standard for white chocolate as the ""common or usual name of products made from cocoa fat (i.e., cocoa butter), milk solids, nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners, and other safe and suitable ingredients, but containing no nonfat cocoa solids"".[38]\n\nDark\n\nDark chocolate is produced by adding fat and sugar to the cocoa mixture. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration calls this ""sweet chocolate"", and requires a 15% concentration of chocolate liquor. European rules specify a minimum of 35% cocoa solids.[37] A higher amount of cocoa solids indicates more bitterness. Semisweet chocolate is dark chocolate with low sugar content. Bittersweet chocolate is chocolate liquor to which some sugar (typically a third), more cocoa butter and vanilla are added.[39] It has less sugar and more liquor than semisweet chocolate, but the two are interchangeable in baking. It is also known to last for two years if stored properly. As of 2017 , there is no high-quality evidence that dark chocolate affects blood pressure significantly or provides other health benefits.[40]\n\nUnsweetened\n\nUnsweetened chocolate is pure chocolate liquor, also known as bitter or baking chocolate. It is unadulterated chocolate: the pure, ground, roasted chocolate beans impart a strong, deep chocolate flavor. It is typically used in baking or other products to which sugar and other ingredients are added. Raw chocolate, often referred to as raw cocoa, is always dark and a minimum of 75% cocoa.\n\nUnsweetened ""Baking"" Chocolate\n\nPoorly tempered or untempered chocolate may have whitish spots on the dark chocolate part, called chocolate bloom; it is an indication that sugar or fat has separated due to poor storage. It is not toxic and can be safely consumed.[41]\n\nProduction\n\nChocolate is created from the cocoa bean. A cacao tree with fruit pods in various stages of ripening.\n\nRoughly two-thirds of the entire world\'s cocoa is produced in West Africa, with 43% sourced from C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire,[42] where, as of 2007 , child labor is a common practice to obtain the product.[43][44] According to the World Cocoa Foundation, in 2007 some 50 million people around the world depended on cocoa as a source of livelihood.[45] As of 2007 in the UK, most chocolatiers purchase their chocolate from them, to melt, mold and package to their own design.[46] According to the WCF\'s 2012 report, the Ivory Coast is the largest producer of cocoa in the world.[47] The two main jobs associated with creating chocolate candy are chocolate makers and chocolatiers. Chocolate makers use harvested cocoa beans and other ingredients to produce couverture chocolate (covering). Chocolatiers use the finished couverture to make chocolate candies (bars, truffles, etc.).[48]\n\nProduction costs can be decreased by reducing cocoa solids content or by substituting cocoa butter with another fat. Cocoa growers object to allowing the resulting food to be called ""chocolate"", due to the risk of lower demand for their crops.[45]\n\nGenome\n\nThe sequencing in 2010 of the genome of the cacao tree may allow yields to be improved.[49] Due to concerns about global warming effects on lowland climate in the narrow band of latitudes where cocoa is grown (20 degrees north and south of the equator), the commercial company Mars, Incorporated and the University of California, Berkeley are conducting genomic research in 2017\xe2\x80\x9318 to improve the survivability of cacao plants in hot climates.[50]\n\nCacao varieties\n\nChocolate is made from cocoa beans, the dried and fermented seeds of the cacao tree (Theobroma cacao), a small, 4\xe2\x80\x938 m tall (15\xe2\x80\x9326 ft tall) evergreen tree native to the deep tropical region of the Americas. Recent genetic studies suggest the most common genotype of the plant originated in the Amazon basin and was gradually transported by humans throughout South and Central America. Early forms of another genotype have also been found in what is now Venezuela. The scientific name, Theobroma, means ""food of the gods"".[51] The fruit, called a cocoa pod, is ovoid, 15\xe2\x80\x9330 cm (6\xe2\x80\x9312 in) long and 8\xe2\x80\x9310 cm (3\xe2\x80\x934 in) wide, ripening yellow to orange, and weighing about 500 g (1.1 lb) when ripe.\n\nCacao trees are small, understory trees that need rich, well-drained soils. They naturally grow within 20\xc2\xb0 of either side of the equator because they need about 2000 mm of rainfall a year, and temperatures in the range of 21 to 32 \xc2\xb0C (70 to 90 \xc2\xb0F). Cacao trees cannot tolerate a temperature lower than 15 \xc2\xb0C (59 \xc2\xb0F).[52]\n\nThe three main varieties of cocoa beans used in chocolate are criollo, forastero, and trinitario.\n\nCriollo\n\nRepresenting only 5% of all cocoa beans grown as of 2008 ,[53] criollo is the rarest and most expensive cocoa on the market, and is native to Central America, the Caribbean islands and the northern tier of South American states.[54] The genetic purity of cocoas sold today as criollo is disputed, as most populations have been exposed to the genetic influence of other varieties.\n\nCriollos are particularly difficult to grow, as they are vulnerable to a variety of environmental threats and produce low yields of cocoa per tree. The flavor of criollo is described as delicate yet complex, low in classic chocolate flavor, but rich in ""secondary"" notes of long duration.[55]\n\nForastero\n\nThe most commonly grown bean is forastero,[53] a large group of wild and cultivated cocoas, most likely native to the Amazon basin. The African cocoa crop is entirely made up of forastero. They are significantly hardier and of higher yield than criollo. The source of most chocolate marketed,[53] forastero cocoas are typically strong in classic ""chocolate"" flavor, but have a short duration and are unsupported by secondary flavors, producing ""quite bland"" chocolate.[53]\n\nTrinitario\n\nTrinitario is a natural hybrid of criollo and forastero. Trinitario originated in Trinidad after an introduction of forastero to the local criollo crop. Nearly all cocoa produced over the past five decades is of the forastero or lower-grade trinitario varieties.[56]\n\nProcessing\n\nCocoa pods are harvested by cutting them from the tree using a machete, or by knocking them off the tree using a stick. The beans with their surrounding pulp are removed from the pods and placed in piles or bins, allowing access to micro-organisms so fermentation of the pectin-containing material can begin. Yeasts produce ethanol, lactic acid bacteria produce lactic acid, and acetic acid bacteria produce acetic acid. The fermentation process, which takes up to seven days, also produces several flavor precursors, eventually resulting in the familiar chocolate taste.[57]\n\nIt is important to harvest the pods when they are fully ripe, because if the pod is unripe, the beans will have a low cocoa butter content, or sugars in the white pulp will be insufficient for fermentation, resulting in a weak flavor. After fermentation, the beans must be quickly dried to prevent mold growth. Climate and weather permitting, this is done by spreading the beans out in the sun from five to seven days.[58]\n\nThe dried beans are then transported to a chocolate manufacturing facility. The beans are cleaned (removing twigs, stones, and other debris), roasted, and graded. Next, the shell of each bean is removed to extract the nib. Finally, the nibs are ground and liquefied, resulting in pure chocolate in fluid form: chocolate liquor.[59] The liquor can be further processed into two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter.[60]\n\nBlending\n\nChocolate liquor is blended with the cocoa butter in varying quantities to make different types of chocolate or couverture. The basic blends of ingredients for the various types of chocolate (in order of highest quantity of cocoa liquor first), are:\n\nFountain chocolate is made with high levels of cocoa butter, allowing it to flow gently over a chocolate fountain to serve as dessert fondue\n\nDark chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa liquor, and (sometimes) vanilla\n\nMilk chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa liquor, milk or milk powder, and vanilla\n\nWhite chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, milk or milk powder, and vanilla\n\nUsually, an emulsifying agent, such as soy lecithin, is added, though a few manufacturers prefer to exclude this ingredient for purity reasons and to remain GMO-free, sometimes at the cost of a perfectly smooth texture. Some manufacturers are now using PGPR, an artificial emulsifier derived from castor oil that allows them to reduce the amount of cocoa butter while maintaining the same mouthfeel.\n\nThe texture is also heavily influenced by processing, specifically conching (see below). The more expensive chocolate tends to be processed longer and thus has a smoother texture and mouthfeel, regardless of whether emulsifying agents are added.\n\nDifferent manufacturers develop their own ""signature"" blends based on the above formulas, but varying proportions of the different constituents are used. The finest, plain dark chocolate couverture contains at least 70% cocoa (both solids and butter), whereas milk chocolate usually contains up to 50%. High-quality white chocolate couverture contains only about 35% cocoa butter.\n\nProducers of high-quality, small-batch chocolate argue that mass production produces bad-quality chocolate.[53] Some mass-produced chocolate contains much less cocoa (as low as 7% in many cases), and fats other than cocoa butter. Vegetable oils and artificial vanilla flavor are often used in cheaper chocolate to mask poorly fermented and/or roasted beans.[53]\n\nIn 2007, the Chocolate Manufacturers Association in the United States, whose members include Hershey, Nestl\xc3\xa9, and Archer Daniels Midland, lobbied the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to change the legal definition of chocolate to let them substitute partially hydrogenated vegetable oils for cocoa butter, in addition to using artificial sweeteners and milk substitutes.[61] Currently, the FDA does not allow a product to be referred to as ""chocolate"" if the product contains any of these ingredients.[62][63]\n\nIn the EU a product can be sold as chocolate if it contains up to 5% vegetable oil, and must be labeled as ""family milk chocolate"" rather than ""milk chocolate"" if it contains 20% milk.[64]\n\nAccording to Canadian Food and Drug Regulations,[65] a ""chocolate product"" is a food product that is sourced from at least one ""cocoa product"" and contains at least one of the following: ""chocolate, bittersweet chocolate, semi-sweet chocolate, dark chocolate, sweet chocolate, milk chocolate, or white chocolate"". A ""cocoa product"" is defined as a food product that is sourced from cocoa beans and contains ""cocoa nibs, cocoa liquor, cocoa mass, unsweetened chocolate, bitter chocolate, chocolate liquor, cocoa, low-fat cocoa, cocoa powder, or low-fat cocoa powder"".\n\nConching\n\nChocolate melanger mixing raw ingredients\n\nThe penultimate process is called conching. A conche is a container filled with metal beads, which act as grinders. The refined and blended chocolate mass is kept in a liquid state by frictional heat. Chocolate before conching has an uneven and gritty texture. The conching process produces cocoa and sugar particles smaller than the tongue can detect (typically around 20 \xce\xbcm) and reduces rough edges, hence the smooth feel in the mouth. The length of the conching process determines the final smoothness and quality of the chocolate. High-quality chocolate is conched for about 72 hours, and lesser grades about four to six hours. After the process is complete, the chocolate mass is stored in tanks heated to about 45 to 50 \xc2\xb0C (113 to 122 \xc2\xb0F) until final processing.[66]\n\nTempering\n\nVideo of cocoa beans being ground and mixed with other ingredients to make chocolate at a Mayordomo store in Oaxaca\n\nThe final process is called tempering. Uncontrolled crystallization of cocoa butter typically results in crystals of varying size, some or all large enough to be seen with the naked eye. This causes the surface of the chocolate to appear mottled and matte, and causes the chocolate to crumble rather than snap when broken.[67][68] The uniform sheen and crisp bite of properly processed chocolate are the results of consistently small cocoa butter crystals produced by the tempering process.\n\nThe fats in cocoa butter can crystallize in six different forms (polymorphous crystallization).[67][69] The primary purpose of tempering is to assure that only the best form is present. The six different crystal forms have different properties.\n\nCrystal Melting temp. Notes I 17 \xc2\xb0C (63 \xc2\xb0F) Soft, crumbly, melts too easily II 21 \xc2\xb0C (70 \xc2\xb0F) Soft, crumbly, melts too easily III 26 \xc2\xb0C (79 \xc2\xb0F) Firm, poor snap, melts too easily IV 28 \xc2\xb0C (82 \xc2\xb0F) Firm, good snap, melts too easily V 34 \xc2\xb0C (93 \xc2\xb0F) Glossy, firm, best snap, melts near body temperature (37 \xc2\xb0C) VI 36 \xc2\xb0C (97 \xc2\xb0F) Hard, takes weeks to form\n\nMolten chocolate and a piece of a chocolate bar\n\nAs a solid piece of chocolate, the cocoa butter fat particles are in a crystalline rigid structure that gives the chocolate its solid appearance. Once heated, the crystals of the polymorphic cocoa butter can break apart from the rigid structure and allow the chocolate to obtain a more fluid consistency as the temperature increases \xe2\x80\x93 the melting process. When the heat is removed, the cocoa butter crystals become rigid again and come closer together, allowing the chocolate to solidify.[70]\n\nThe temperature in which the crystals obtain enough energy to break apart from their rigid conformation would depend on the milk fat content in the chocolate and the shape of the fat molecules, as well as the form of the cocoa butterfat. Chocolate with a higher fat content will melt at a lower temperature.[71]\n\nMaking chocolate considered ""good"" is about forming as many type V crystals as possible. This provides the best appearance and texture and creates the most stable crystals, so the texture and appearance will not degrade over time. To accomplish this, the temperature is carefully manipulated during the crystallization.\n\npistoles and callets Chocolate cubes,and\n\nGenerally, the chocolate is first heated to 45 \xc2\xb0C (113 \xc2\xb0F) to melt all six forms of crystals.[67][69] Next, the chocolate is cooled to about 27 \xc2\xb0C (81 \xc2\xb0F), which will allow crystal types IV and V to form. At this temperature, the chocolate is agitated to create many small crystal ""seeds"" which will serve as nuclei to create small crystals in the chocolate. The chocolate is then heated to about 31 \xc2\xb0C (88 \xc2\xb0F) to eliminate any type IV crystals, leaving just type V. After this point, any excessive heating of the chocolate will destroy the temper and this process will have to be repeated. Other methods of chocolate tempering are used as well. The most common variant is introducing already tempered, solid ""seed"" chocolate. The temper of chocolate can be measured with a chocolate temper meter to ensure accuracy and consistency. A sample cup is filled with the chocolate and placed in the unit which then displays or prints the results.\n\nTwo classic ways of manually tempering chocolate are:\n\nWorking the molten chocolate on a heat-absorbing surface, such as a stone slab, until thickening indicates the presence of sufficient crystal ""seeds""; the chocolate is then gently warmed to working temperature.\n\nStirring solid chocolate into molten chocolate to ""inoculate"" the liquid chocolate with crystals (this method uses the already formed crystals of the solid chocolate to ""seed"" the molten chocolate).\n\nChocolate tempering machines (or temperers) with computer controls can be used for producing consistently tempered chocolate. In particular, continuous tempering machines are used in large volume applications. Various methods and apparatuses for continuous flow tempering have been described by Aasted, Sollich and Buhler, three manufacturers of commercial chocolate equipment, with a focus now on energy efficiency. In general, molten chocolate coming in at 40\xe2\x80\x9350 \xc2\xb0C is cooled in heat exchangers to crystallization temperates of about 26\xe2\x80\x9330 \xc2\xb0C, passed through a tempering column consisting of spinning plates to induce shear, then warmed slightly to re-melt undesirable crystal formations.[72][73]\n\nShaping\n\nChocolate is molded in different shapes for different uses:[74]\n\nChocolate bars (tablets) are rectangular blocks of chocolate meant to be broken down to cubes (or other predefined shapes), which can then be used for consumption, cooking and baking. The term is also used for combination bars, which are a type of candy bars\n\nChocolate chips are small pieces of chocolate, usually drop-like, which are meant for decoration and baking\n\nPistoles , callets and f\xc3\xa8ves are small, coin-like or bean-like pieces of chocolate meant for baking and patisserie applications (also see Pistole (coin) and F\xc3\xa8ve (trinket))\n\n, and are small, coin-like or bean-like pieces of chocolate meant for baking and patisserie applications (also see Pistole (coin) and F\xc3\xa8ve (trinket)) Chocolate blocks are large, cuboid chunks of chocolate meant for professional use and further processing\n\nOther, more specialized shapes for chocolate include sticks, curls and hollow semi-spheres\n\nStorage\n\nChocolate is very sensitive to temperature and humidity. Ideal storage temperatures are between 15 and 17 \xc2\xb0C (59 and 63 \xc2\xb0F), with a relative humidity of less than 50%. If refrigerated or frozen without containment, chocolate can absorb enough moisture to cause a whitish discoloration, the result of fat or sugar crystals rising to the surface. Various types of ""blooming"" effects can occur if chocolate is stored or served improperly.[75]\n\nChocolate bloom is caused by storage temperature fluctuating or exceeding 24 \xc2\xb0C (75 \xc2\xb0F), while sugar bloom is caused by temperature below 15 \xc2\xb0C (59 \xc2\xb0F) or excess humidity. To distinguish between different types of bloom, one can rub the surface of the chocolate lightly, and if the bloom disappears, it is fat bloom. Moving chocolate between temperature extremes, can result in an oily texture. Although visually unappealing, chocolate suffering from bloom is safe for consumption and taste unaffected.[76][77][78] Bloom can be reversed by retempering the chocolate or using it for any use that requires melting the chocolate.[79]\n\nChocolate is generally stored away from other foods, as it can absorb different aromas. Ideally, chocolates are packed or wrapped, and placed in proper storage with the correct humidity and temperature. Additionally, chocolate is frequently stored in a dark place or protected from light by wrapping paper. The glossy shine, snap, aroma, texture, and taste of the chocolate can show the quality and if it was stored well.[80]\n\nComposition\n\nNutrition\n\nA 100-gram serving of milk chocolate supplies 540 calories. It is 59% carbohydrates (52% as sugar and 3% as dietary fiber), 30% fat and 8% protein (table). Approximately 65% of the fat in milk chocolate is saturated, mainly palmitic acid and stearic acid, while the predominant unsaturated fat is oleic acid (table).\n\n100-grams of milk chocolate is an excellent source (over 19% of the Daily Value, DV) of riboflavin, vitamin B12 and the dietary minerals, manganese, phosphorus and zinc. Chocolate is a good source (10\xe2\x80\x9319% DV) of calcium, magnesium and iron.\n\nEffects on health\n\nChocolate may be a factor for heartburn in some people because one of its constituents, theobromine, may affect the esophageal sphincter muscle in a way that permits stomach acids to enter the esophagus.[81] Theobromine poisoning is an overdosage reaction to the bitter alkaloid, which happens more frequently in domestic animals than humans. However, daily intake of 50\xe2\x80\x93100 g cocoa (0.8\xe2\x80\x931.5 g theobromine) by humans has been associated with sweating, trembling and severe headache.[82] Chocolate contains alkaloids such as theobromine and phenethylamine, which have physiological effects in humans, but the presence of theobromine renders it toxic to some animals, including dogs and cats.[83]\n\nAccording to a 2005 study, the average lead concentration of cocoa beans is \xe2\x89\xa4 0.5 ng/g, which is one of the lowest reported values for a natural food.[84] However, during cultivation and production, chocolate may absorb lead from the environment (such as in atmospheric emissions of leaded gasoline, which is still being used in Nigeria).[84] Reports from 2014 indicate that ""chocolate might be a significant source"" of lead ingestion for children if consumption is high (with dark chocolate containing higher amounts),[85][86] and ""one 10 g cube of dark chocolate may contain as much as 20% of the daily lead oral limit.""[85]\n\nChocolate and cocoa contain moderate to high amounts of oxalate,[87][88] which may increase the risk of kidney stones.[89]\n\nA few studies have documented allergic reactions from chocolate in children.[81] Other research has shown that dark chocolate can aggravate acne in men who are prone to it.[90] Research has also shown that consuming dark chocolate does not substantially affect blood pressure.[40] Chocolate and cocoa are under preliminary research to determine if consumption affects the risk of certain cardiovascular diseases[91] or cognitive abilities.[92]\n\nOne tablespoonful (5 grams) of dry unsweetened cocoa powder has 12.1 mg of caffeine[93] and a 25-g single serving of dark chocolate has 22.4 mg of caffeine.[94] Although a single 7 oz. serving of coffee may contain 80\xe2\x80\x93175 mg,[95] studies have shown psychoactive effects in caffeine doses as low as 9 mg,[96] and a dose as low as 12.5 mg was shown to have effects on cognitive performance.[97]\n\nExcessive consumption of large quantities of any energy-rich food, such as chocolate, without a corresponding increase in activity to expend the associated calories, can cause weight gain and possibly lead to obesity.[81] Raw chocolate is high in cocoa butter, a fat which is removed during chocolate refining and then added back in varying proportions during the manufacturing process. Manufacturers may add other fats, sugars, and milk, all of which increase the caloric content of chocolate.[81]\n\nPhytochemicals\n\nIn comparison to most foods, cocoa contains more phenolic antioxidants.[98] Cocoa solids are a source of flavonoids[99] and alkaloids, such as theobromine, phenethylamine, and caffeine.[100]\n\nLabeling\n\nSome manufacturers provide the percentage of chocolate in a finished chocolate confection as a label quoting percentage of ""cocoa"" or ""cacao"". This refers to the combined percentage of both cocoa solids and cocoa butter in the bar, not just the percentage of cocoa solids.[101] The Belgian AMBAO certification mark indicates that no non-cocoa vegetable fats have been used in making the chocolate.[102][103] A long-standing dispute between Britain on the one hand and Belgium and France over British use of vegetable fats in chocolate ended in 2000 with the adoption of new standards which permitted the use of up to five percent vegetable fats in clearly labelled products.[104] This British style of chocolate has sometimes been pejoratively referred to as ""vegelate"".[104]\n\nChocolates that are organic[105] or fair trade certified[106] carry labels accordingly.\n\nIn the United States, some large chocolate manufacturers lobbied the federal government to permit confections containing cheaper hydrogenated vegetable oil in place of cocoa butter to be sold as ""chocolate"". In June 2007, in response to consumer concern about the proposal, the FDA reiterated ""Cacao fat, as one of the signature characteristics of the product, will remain a principal component of standardized chocolate.""[107]\n\nIndustry\n\nChocolate, prevalent throughout the world, is a steadily growing, US$50 billion-a-year worldwide business.[108] Europe accounts for 45% of the world\'s chocolate revenue,[109] and the US spent $20 billion in 2013.[110] Big Chocolate is the grouping of major international chocolate companies in Europe and the U.S. U.S. companies Mars and Hershey\'s alone generated $13 billion a year in chocolate sales and account for two-thirds of U.S. production in 2004.[111] Despite the expanding reach of the chocolate industry internationally, cocoa farmers and labourers in the Ivory Coast are unaware of the uses of the beans; the high cost of chocolate products in the Ivory Coast make it inaccessible to the majority of the population, who do not know what it tastes like.[112]\n\nManufacturers\n\nChocolate with various fillings\n\nChocolate manufacturers produce a range of products from chocolate bars to fudge. Large manufacturers of chocolate products include Cadbury (the world\'s largest confectionery manufacturer), Ferrero, Guylian, The Hershey Company, Lindt & Spr\xc3\xbcngli, Mars, Incorporated, Milka, Neuhaus and Suchard.\n\nGuylian is best known for its chocolate sea shells; Cadbury for its Dairy Milk and Creme Egg. The Hershey Company, the largest chocolate manufacturer in North America, produces the Hershey Bar and Hershey\'s Kisses.[113] Mars Incorporated, a large privately owned U.S. corporation, produces Mars Bar, Milky Way, M&M\'s, Twix, and Snickers. Lindt is known for its truffle balls and gold foil-wrapped Easter bunnies.\n\nFood conglomerates Nestl\xc3\xa9 SA and Kraft Foods both have chocolate brands. Nestl\xc3\xa9 acquired Rowntree\'s in 1988 and now markets chocolates under their brand, including Smarties (a chocolate candy) and Kit Kat (a chocolate bar); Kraft Foods through its 1990 acquisition of Jacobs Suchard, now owns Milka and Suchard. In February 2010, Kraft also acquired British-based Cadbury;[114] Fry\'s, Trebor Basset and the fair trade brand Green & Black\'s also belongs to the group.\n\nChild labor in cocoa harvesting\n\nThe widespread use of children in cocoa production is controversial, not only for the concerns about child labor and exploitation, but also because up to 12,000 of the 200,000 children working in C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire, the world\'s biggest producer of cocoa,[115] may be victims of trafficking or slavery.[116] Most attention on this subject has focused on West Africa, which collectively supplies 69 percent of the world\'s cocoa, and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire in particular, which supplies 35 percent of the world\'s cocoa. Thirty percent of children under age 15 in sub-Saharan Africa are child laborers, mostly in agricultural activities including cocoa farming.[118] Major chocolate producers, such as Nestl\xc3\xa9, buy cocoa at commodities exchanges where Ivorian cocoa is mixed with other cocoa.[119]\n\nIn 2009, Salvation Army International Development (SAID) UK stated that 12,000 children have been trafficked on cocoa farms in the Ivory Coast of Africa, where half of the world\'s chocolate is made.[120] SAID UK states that it is these child slaves who are likely to be working in ""harsh and abusive""[121] conditions for the production of chocolate,[120] and an increasing number of health-food[122] and anti-slavery[123] organisations are highlighting and campaigning against the use of trafficking in the chocolate industry.\n\nAs of 2017, approximately 2.1 million children in Ghana and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire were involved in farming cocoa, carrying heavy loads, clearing forests, and being exposed to pesticides.[5] According to Sona Ebai, the former secretary-general of the Alliance of Cocoa Producing Countries: ""I think child labor cannot be just the responsibility of industry to solve. I think it\'s the proverbial all-hands-on-deck: government, civil society, the private sector. And there, you need leadership.""[116] Reported in 2018, a 3-year pilot program \xe2\x80\x93 conducted by Nestl\xc3\xa9 with 26,000 farmers mostly located in C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire \xe2\x80\x93 observed a 51% decrease in the number of children doing hazardous jobs in cocoa farming.[4] The US Department of Labor formed the Child Labor Cocoa Coordinating Group as a public-private partnership with the governments of Ghana and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire to address child labor practices in the cocoa industry.[124] The International Cocoa Initiative involving major cocoa manufacturers established the Child Labor Monitoring and Remediation System intended to monitor thousands of farms in Ghana and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire for child labor conditions,[4][5] but the program reached less than 20% of the child laborers.[125] Despite these efforts, goals to reduce child labor in West Africa by 70% before 2020 are frustrated by persistent poverty, absence of schools, expansion of cocoa farmland, and increased demand for cocoa.[4][126]\n\nIn April 2018, the Cocoa Barometer report stated: ""Not a single company or government is anywhere near reaching the sector-wide objective of the elimination of child labor, and not even near their commitments of a 70% reduction of child labor by 2020"".[126]\n\nFair trade\n\nIn the 2000s, some chocolate producers began to engage in fair trade initiatives, to address concerns about the marginalization of cocoa laborers in developing countries. Traditionally, Africa and other developing countries received low prices for their exported commodities such as cocoa, which caused poverty to abound. Fairtrade seeks to establish a system of direct trade from developing countries to counteract this unfair system.[127] One solution for fair labor practices is for farmers to become part of an Agricultural cooperative. Cooperatives pay farmers a fair price for their cocoa so farmers have enough money for food, clothes, and school fees.[128] One of the main tenets of fair trade is that farmers receive a fair price, but this does not mean that the larger amount of money paid for fair trade cocoa goes directly to the farmers. The effectiveness of fair trade has been questioned. In a 2014 article, The Economist stated that workers on fair trade farms have a lower standard of living than on similar farms outside the fair trade system.[129]\n\nUsage and consumption\n\ns\'more topped with melted chocolate from a chocolate bar\n\nChocolate cake with chocolate frosting\n\nBars\n\nChocolate is sold in chocolate bars, which come in dark chocolate, milk chocolate and white chocolate varieties.

"103.txt";"b'But what effect does eating chocolate have on our health?\n\nChocolate has since become a popular food product that millions enjoy every day, thanks to its unique, rich, and sweet taste.\n\nAfter the European discovery of the Americas, chocolate became very popular in the wider world, and its demand exploded.\n\nChocolate is made from tropical Theobroma cacao tree seeds. Its earliest use dates back to the Olmec civilization in Mesoamerica.\n\nThe next time you eat a piece of chocolate, you may not have to feel so guilty about it. Despite its bad reputation for causing weight gain, a number of health benefits may be associated with this delicious treat.\n\nShare on Pinterest Recent research suggests that chocolate may have some health benefits.\n\nChocolate receives a lot of bad press because of its high fat and sugar content. Its consumption has been associated with acne, obesity, high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, and diabetes.\n\nHowever, according to a review of chocolate\xe2\x80\x99s health effects published in the Netherlands Journal of Medicine, it\xe2\x80\x99s not all bad news.\n\nThe authors point to the discovery that cocoa, the key ingredient in chocolate, contains biologically active phenolic compounds.\n\nThis has changed people\xe2\x80\x99s views on chocolate, and it has stimulated research into how it might impact aging, and conditions such as oxidative stress, blood pressure regulation, and atherosclerosis.\n\nChocolate\xe2\x80\x99s antioxidant potential may have a range of health benefits. The higher the cocoa content, as in dark chocolate, the more benefits there are. Dark chocolate may also contain less fat and sugar, but it is important to check the label.\n\nEating chocolate may have the following benefits:\n\nlowering cholesterol levels\n\npreventing cognitive decline\n\nreducing the risk of cardiovascular problems\n\nIt is important to note that the possible health benefits mentioned below came from single studies. More research is needed to confirm that eating chocolate can really improve people\xe2\x80\x99s health.\n\nIn addition, chocolate bars do not contain only cocoa. The benefits and risks of any other ingredients, such as sugar and fat, need to be considered.\n\n1) Cholesterol\n\nOne study, published in The Journal of Nutrition, suggests that chocolate consumption might help reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, also known as \xe2\x80\x9cbad cholesterol.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe researchers set out to investigate whether chocolate bars containing plant sterols (PS) and cocoa flavanols (CF) have any effect on cholesterol levels.\n\nThe authors concluded: \xe2\x80\x9cRegular consumption of chocolate bars containing PS and CF, as part of a low-fat diet, may support cardiovascular health by lowering cholesterol and improving blood pressure.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n2) Cognitive function\n\nScientists at Harvard Medical School have suggested that drinking two cups of hot chocolate a day could help keep the brain healthy and reduce memory decline in older people.\n\nThe researchers found that hot chocolate helped improve blood flow to parts of the brain where it was needed.\n\nLead author, Farzaneh A. Sorond, said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs different areas of the brain need more energy to complete their tasks, they also need greater blood flow. This relationship, called neurovascular coupling, may play an important role in diseases such as Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nResults of a lab experiment, published in 2014, indicated that a cocoa extract, called lavado, might reduce or prevent damage to nerve pathways found in patients with Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s disease. This extract could help slow symptoms such as cognitive decline.\n\nAnother study, published in 2016 in the journal Appetite, suggests eating chocolate at least once weekly could improve cognitive function.\n\n3) Heart disease\n\nResearch published in The BMJ, suggests that consuming chocolate could help lower the risk of developing heart disease by one-third .\n\nBased on their observations, the authors concluded that higher levels of chocolate consumption could be linked to a lower risk of cardiometabolic disorders.\n\nThey call for further experimental studies to confirm whether consuming chocolate is beneficial.\n\n4) Stroke\n\nCanadian scientists, in a study involving 44,489 individuals, found that people who ate one serving of chocolate were 22 percent less likely to experience a stroke than those who did not. Also, those who had about two ounces of chocolate a week were 46 percent less likely to die from a stroke.\n\nA further study, published in the journal Heart in 2015, tracked the impact of diet on the long-term health of 25,000 men and women.\n\nThe findings suggested that eating up to 100 grams (g) of chocolate each day may be linked to a lower risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\n5) Fetal growth and development\n\nEating 30 g (about one ounce) of chocolate every day during pregnancy might benefit fetal growth and development, according to a study presented at the 2016 Pregnancy Meeting of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine in Atlanta, GA.\n\n6) Athletic performance\n\nShare on Pinterest Chocolate may help athletes cover more distance while using less oxygen.\n\nFindings published in The Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition suggest that a little dark chocolate might boost oxygen availability during fitness training.\n\nResearchers who studied cyclists doing time trials in the United Kingdom found that \xe2\x80\x9cAfter eating dark chocolate, the riders used less oxygen when cycling at a moderate pace and also covered more distance in a two-minute flat-out time trial.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe scientists believe that the success of dark chocolate in this case is that it contains flavonols known as epicatechins, which enhance the release of nitric oxide in the body. Beetroot juice has a similar effect.'";"Other";"103.txt-Other"

"1037.txt";"b'Rory McIlroy sympathizes with Bryson DeChambeau following the taunting he\'s received from fans in recent tournaments. (1:23)\n\nThis year marks a major milestone for the Tour Championship: the 25th anniversary of Happy Gilmore\'s storied victory.\n\nThat\'s right, it has already been 25 years since one of the greatest performances of our generation, er -- since the fictional character from Adam Sandler\'s 1996 cult classic ""Happy Gilmore"" won the season-ending Tour Championship.\n\nFor those in need of a refresher, Gilmore overcame a 4-stroke deficit on the back nine to defeat his greatest rival, Shooter McGavin. The win cemented Gilmore\'s meteoric rise from a failed hockey player with a powerful slapshot -- something that translated surprisingly well into his unorthodox yet effective putting style -- to a bona fide star.\n\nIt was a uniquely special moment for Gilmore, whose journey to the gold jacket was marred with controversy (he once engaged in a public fistfight with beloved TV presenter Bob Barker during a celebrity pro-am tournament), as he was playing in honor of his mentor -- the late, great Chubbs Peterson.\n\nOn Wednesday, to recognize the 25-year milestone of Gilmore\'s achievement, fellow Tour Championship winner Rory McIlroy presented a commemorative inscription at East Lake Golf Club in Atlanta.\n\n""Gold Jacket. Green Jacket. Who gives a ...

"1039.txt";"b""How are returns an opportunity?\n\nRetailers of the future improve their business in four ways:\n\n\n\n1) To retain revenue. Happy Returns' customers increase their exchange rates up to 36% by offering one-click suggestions.\n\n\n\n2) To reduce costs. Retailers overspend on traditional reverse logistics. They save 20% on average when they accept exchanges and returns in person, and ship aggregated items in bulk.\n\n\n\n3) To raise customer lifetime value. Three in four shoppers say returns are the most painful part of buying online, and 87% won\xe2\x80\x99t shop ever again after a painful returns\xe2\x80\x99 experience with a retailer. Conversely, Happy Returns' customers find their most valuable customers shop, return, and exchange the most often.\n\n\n\n4) To enhance sustainability. eCommerce returns waste 1B trees a year. Replacing cardboard boxes with reusable containers, and shipping in bulk, saves trees and fuel.\n\nWhat is a one-click exchange?\n\nWhen a shopper says an item is too big, we show the next smaller size that's available. Shoppers then exchange items with a single click.\n\nWhy is optimizing exchanges inevitable?\n\nSimply by offering one-click exchanges in their online returns flows, Happy Returns customers increase exchanges up to 36%. The suggestions reflect what shoppers say they don't like about the product.\n\nWhy should retailers outsource returns management?\n\nYou have many goals that require your attention. By piecemealing your returns management process, you overspend on reverse logistics\xe2\x80\x94and likely over-burden your customer service team.\n\n\n\nUnlike other providers, our solution is comprehensive. We work with you every step of the way\xe2\x80\x94initiating, accepting, and processing exchanges and returns.\n\nHow do aggregated shipping and reusable packaging benefit my business?\n\nItems that are shipped in bulk in sustainable packaging make your supply chain more efficient, less costly, and sustainable.\n\n\n\nShoppers bring items to our nationwide Return Bars from multiple retailers, where they're stored in reusable containers. We pick them up and take them to their next destination.\n\nHow many return locations does Happy Returns have?\n\nOur nationwide network now exceeds 2,500 Return Bar locations serving 288 metros across every state in the continental US, plus the District of Columbia.""";"Other";"1039.txt-Other"

He has a rectangular head, with pink ears, big black eyes with small, thin eyebrows, and light blue cheek marks near to his tiny whiskers (two on each side of his face). Happy has a triangular nose that leads to semi-round upper lips on the sides. His body is rectangular too, and being an Exceed, it has a structure that allows him to walk erect, unlike normal cats. Despite having no thumbs, Happy is able to hold things.[4] He has a long, white-tipped tail; and the other parts of his tail are blue. Additionally, Happy is able to use his tail to hold onto objects.[5] Happy is usually seen carrying around a green backpack, where he keeps food and items that can be used in battle. This backpack also covers his green Guild Mark that is on his back.[6] When using his Magic, he can grow a pair of large, feathered, angel-like wings that allow him to fly around and carry others. Happy usually does not wear clothes, the only few times being during the Fantasia Parade,[7] to disguise himself in Edolas,[8] and when his parents gave him clothes, again in Edolas.[9]\n\nPersonality\n\nDespite his small stature and eccentric appearance, Happy is very loyal to his teammates and fellow guild members and has a fairly significant amount of knowledge of the Magic world, in some cases, more than Lucy and Natsu. Given that he has been around Natsu Dragneel since his own birth, Happy often emulates Natsu in his actions and responses. He is quick-witted and cheeky, especially to Lucy Heartfilia; however, Happy sometimes shows little bits of a darker side of himself, for example when making a comment on the devastating aspects of the Magic of his comrades.\n\nHe loves fish more than anything else, and he doesn\'t like dogs (except for Plue).[2] He offers a comic relief with his catchphrase, ""Aye!"" or ""Aye Sir!"". He holds a respect and admiration to Exceed like himself and drools on Loke\'s shoulder when he finds out that Loke is the celestial spirit of Leo the Lion. Happy has also developed a strong affection towards Carla, another Exceed who at first blows him off, but then begins to like and respect him.\n\nMagic and Abilities\n\nAera ( \xe7\xbf\xbc ( \xe3\x82\xa8\xe3\x83\xbc\xe3\x83\xa9 ) \xc4\x92ra): Happy is able to sprout angelic wings that give him the ability to fly and carry objects or one person at a time for a specific amount of time.[10]\n\nMax Speed (\xe3\x82\xb9\xe3\x83\x94\xe3\x83\xbc\xe3\x83\x89 Makkusu Sup\xc4\xabdo ): Happy utilizes a considerable amount of Magic Power to fly as fast as he can. This speed can be used to dodge incoming attacks or to attack the enemy. A disadvantage of this technique would be a rapid loss of Magic Power, in relation to how long Happy uses this technique. [11] Max Speed Attack : While using Max Speed, Happy flies as fast as he can, and then strikes the opponent with his own head. This attack was powerful enough to destroy a Thunder Palace Lacrima, which was about twice the size of Happy. [12]\n\n(\xe3\x82\xb9\xe3\x83\x94\xe3\x83\xbc\xe3\x83\x89 ): Happy utilizes a considerable amount of Magic Power to fly as fast as he can. This speed can be used to dodge incoming attacks or to attack the enemy. A disadvantage of this technique would be a rapid loss of Magic Power, in relation to how long Happy uses this technique.\n\nTransformation Magic (\xe5\xa4\x89\xe8\xba\xab\xe9\xad\x94\xe6\xb3\x95 Henshin Mah\xc5\x8d): Mirajane taught Happy, Natsu and Lucy basic spells of Transformation Magic.[13] However, Happy is only able to transform into a super deformed version of Lucy. Unfortunately, his attempt was a failure and in Lucy\'s words, ""creepy"".[14]\n\nEnhanced Durability: Despite his small and seemingly frail stature, Happy has proven to possess incredible durability by surviving a city-wide explosion caused by Jackal, one of the Nine Demon Gates, despite being in the center of the explosion when it occurred.[15]\n\nFormer Magic and Abilities\n\nUshi no Koku Mairi (\xe4\xb8\x91\xe3\x81\xae\xe5\x88\xbb\xe5\x8f\x82\xe3\x82\x8a Ushi no Koku Mairi): During their fight against Kain, he catches the Mr. Cursey doll Natsu threw to him. While flying he used it, while it had Lucy\'s hair, delivered an attack on him.[16]\n\nSecret Attack: Lucy Fire (\xe5\xbf\x85\xe6\xae\xba\xe3\x83\xbb\xe3\x83\xab\xe3\x83\xbc\xe3\x82\xb7\xe3\x82\xa3\xe3\x83\x95\xe3\x82\xa1\xe3\x82\xa4\xe3\x82\xa2 Hissatsu: R\xc5\xabshi Faia): While he was controlling Mr. Cursey and after Natsu had ignited Lucy, Happy used Max Speed to make Lucy\'s whole body catch on fire, and had her deliver a brutal kick to Kain Hikaru.[16]\n\nFire Magic (\xe7\x81\xab\xe3\x81\xae\xe9\xad\x94\xe6\xb3\x95 Hi no Mah\xc5\x8d): After consuming a strange fruit, Happy turned red (calling himself ""Red Happy"") and gained the ability to breathe fire. It faded after one usage, but returned once more during the visit to Toma E. Fiore, only to disappear again after a sudden release of fire.[17]\n\nCatmander\'s Roar (\xe3\x83\x8d\xe3\x82\xb3\xe3\x83\x9e\xe3\x83\xb3\xe3\x83\x80\xe3\x83\xbc\xe3\x81\xae\xe5\x92\x86\xe5\x93\xae Nekomand\xc4\x81 no H\xc5\x8dk\xc5\x8d):[18] Happy releases a blast of Fire Magic from his mouth, it was potent enough to knock out Red Knife.[17]\n\nYokai Form: While under the effects of Youko\'s Hyakki Yagy\xc5\x8d, Happy is transformed into a Yokai called Suiko. While in this form, Happy\'s appearance changes into a large quadruped tiger while also carrying his enlarged backpack.[19]\n\nSpirit Power (\xe9\x9c\x8a\xe5\x8a\x9b Reiryoku ): While in this form, Happy gains access to this spiritual power while also being enhanced several times by Youko. [20]\n\n(\xe9\x9c\x8a\xe5\x8a\x9b ): While in this form, Happy gains access to this spiritual power while also being enhanced several times by Youko. Ice Resistance: While in this form, Happy is able to resist being frozen by Gray\'s Magic.[21]\n\nEquipment\n\nBackpack: A small green backpack that Happy uses to carry snacks.[22]\n\nFish (or other food products): Happy is constantly seen using fish or fruits in battle. He uses them as blunt weapons, and also as swords. His range of ""weapons"" varies from fish to octopi to crabs.[23]\n\nTrivia\n\nHappy\'s likes include fish. His dislikes include dogs, although he\'s fine with Plue. [2]\n\nHiro Mashima was originally going to name Happy ""Freyr"" after the Norse god but didn\'t think it would suit his character. [24]\n\nFrom the Volume 16 Limited Edition: Sorcerer Interview, the best quality of Fairy Tail according to Happy was that ""Fairy Tail made the best fish entrees""! He wants to see Igneel in the future. Has a good relationship with Natsu and Lucy. The hardest job Happy ever took was fishing for the Winged Fishes, which tasted horrible.[25]\n\nQuotes\n\n(To Lucy about Erza\'s Magic) ""Erza\'s Magic is beautiful. Plenty of blood came out in the end. Her opponent\'s blood."" [26]\n\n(To Nichiya and Nadi) ""We\'re not your puppets!! We are... Mages of Fairy Tail!!!"" [27]\n\n(To Byro Cracy) ""What kind of rightful cause makes people sad and suffer?! In Edolas, we saw a lot of people suffering and Exceeds going through hardships! A path that forces you to cause people pain and sacrifice them along the way is one that\'ll eventually fall to pieces and disappear! Is that the way you want everyone to go?! Even a fish is free to swim whenever it wants in the water, right?! Well, we\'re the same! We take requests from people who are in trouble and help them, so they can be happy and we get a reward. That\'s how we\'ve been operating all along. That\'s what a guild does! Against you and that fake righteousness you hold over your head, Fairy Tail isn\'t gonna be beat!""

"1049.txt";"b'Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s possible Happiness looks different for everyone. For you, maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s being at peace with who you are. Or having a secure network of friends who accept you unconditionally. Or the freedom to pursue your deepest dreams. Regardless of your version of true happiness, living a happier, more satisfied life is within reach. A few tweaks to your regular habits can help you get there. Habits matter. If you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever tried breaking a bad habit, you know all too well how engrained they are. Well, good habits are deeply engrained, too. Why not work on making positive habits part of your routine? Here\xe2\x80\x99s a look at some daily, monthly, and yearly habits to help kickstart your quest. Just remember that everyone\xe2\x80\x99s version of happiness is a little different, and so is their path to achieving it. If some of these habits create added stress or just don\xe2\x80\x99t fit your lifestyle, ditch them. With a little time and practice, you\xe2\x80\x99ll figure out what does and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work for you.\n\nDaily habits 1. Smile You tend to smile when you\xe2\x80\x99re happy. But it\xe2\x80\x99s actually a two-way street. We smile because we\xe2\x80\x99re happy, and smiling causes the brain to release dopamine, which makes us happier. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean you have to go around with a fake smile plastered on your face all the time. But the next time you find yourself feeling low, crack a smile and see what happens. Or try starting each morning by smiling at yourself in the mirror. 2. Exercise Exercise isn\xe2\x80\x99t just for your body. Regular exercise can help to reduce stress, feelings of anxiety, and symptoms of depression while boosting self-esteem and happiness. Even a small amount of physical activity can make a difference. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to train for a triathlon or scale a cliff \xe2\x80\x94 unless that\xe2\x80\x99s what makes you happy, of course. The trick is not to overexert. If you suddenly throw yourself into a strenuous routine, you\xe2\x80\x99ll probably just end up frustrated (and sore). Consider these exercise starters: Take a walk around the block every night after dinner.\n\nSign up for a beginner\xe2\x80\x99s class in yoga or tai chi.\n\nStart your day with 5 minutes of stretching. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a set of stretches to get you started. Remind yourself of any fun activities you once enjoyed, but that have fallen by the wayside. Or activities you always wanted to try, such as golf, bowling, or dancing. 3. Get plenty of sleep No matter how much modern society steers us toward less sleep, we know that adequate sleep is vital to good health, brain function, and emotional well-being. Most adults need about 7 or 8 hours of sleep every night. If you find yourself fighting the urge to nap during the day or just generally feel like you\xe2\x80\x99re in a fog, your body may be telling you it needs more rest. Here are a few tips to help you build a better sleep routine: Write down how many hours of sleep you get each night and how rested you feel. After a week, you should have a better idea how you\xe2\x80\x99re doing.\n\nGo to bed and wake up at the same time every day, including weekends.\n\nReserve the hour before bed as quiet time. Take a bath, read, or do something relaxing. Avoid heavy eating and drinking.\n\nKeep your bedroom dark, cool, and quiet.\n\nInvest in some good bedding.\n\nIf you have to take a nap, try to limit it to 20 minutes. If you consistently have problems sleeping, talk to your doctor. You may have a sleep disorder requiring treatment. 4. Eat with mood in mind You already know that food choices have an impact on your overall physical health. But some foods can also affect your state of mind. For example: Carbohydrates release serotonin, a \xe2\x80\x9cfeel good\xe2\x80\x9d hormone. Just keep simple carbs \xe2\x80\x94 foods high in sugar and starch \xe2\x80\x94 to a minimum, because that energy surge is short and you\xe2\x80\x99ll crash. Complex carbs, such as vegetables, beans, and whole grains, are better.\n\nrelease serotonin, a \xe2\x80\x9cfeel good\xe2\x80\x9d hormone.

Highly processed or deep-fried foods tend to leave you feeling down. So will skipping meals. Start by making one better food choice each day. For example, swap a big, sweet breakfast pastry for some Greek yogurt with fruit. You\xe2\x80\x99ll still satisfy your sweet tooth, and the protein will help you avoid a mid-morning energy crash. Try adding in a new food swap each week. 5. Be grateful Simply being grateful can give your mood a big boost, among other benefits. For example, a recent two-part study found that practicing gratitude can have a significant impact on feelings of hope and happiness. Start each day by acknowledging one thing you\xe2\x80\x99re grateful for. You can do this while you\xe2\x80\x99re brushing your teeth or just waiting for that snoozed alarm to go off. As you go about your day, try to keep an eye out for pleasant things in your life. They can be big things, such as knowing that someone loves you or getting a well-deserved promotion. But they can also be little things, such as a co-worker who offered you a cup of coffee or the neighbor who waved to you. Maybe even just the warmth of the sun on your skin. With a little practice, you may even become more aware of all the positive things around you. 6. Give a compliment Research shows that performing acts of kindness can help you feel more satisfied. Giving a sincere compliment is a quick, easy way to brighten someone\xe2\x80\x99s day while giving your own happiness a boost. Catch the person\xe2\x80\x99s eye and say it with a smile so they know you mean it. You might be surprised by how good it makes you feel. If you want to offer someone a compliment on their physical appearance, make sure to do it in a respectful way. Here are some tips to get you started. 7. Breathe deeply You\xe2\x80\x99re tense, your shoulders are tight, and you feel as though you just might \xe2\x80\x9close it.\xe2\x80\x9d We all know that feeling. Instinct may tell you to take a long, deep breath to calm yourself down. Turns out, that instinct is a good\n\none. According to Harvard Health, deep breathing exercises can help\n\nreduce stress. The next time you feel stressed or at your wit\xe2\x80\x99s end, work through these steps: Close your eyes. Try to envision a happy memory or beautiful place. Take a slow, deep breath in through your nose. Slowly breathe out through your mouth or nose. Repeat this process several times, until you start to feel yourself calm down. If you\xe2\x80\x99re having a hard time taking slow, deliberate breaths, try counting to 5 in your head with each inhale and exhale. 8. Acknowledge the unhappy moments A positive attitude is generally a good thing, but bad things happen to everyone. It\xe2\x80\x99s just part of life. If you get some bad news, make a mistake, or just feel like you\xe2\x80\x99re in a funk, don\xe2\x80\x99t try to pretend you\xe2\x80\x99re happy. Acknowledge the feeling of unhappiness, letting yourself experience it for a moment. Then, shift your focus toward what made you feel this way and what it might take to recover. Would a deep breathing exercise help? A long walk outside? Talking it over with someone? Let the moment pass and take care of yourself. Remember, no one\xe2\x80\x99s happy all the time. 9. Keep a journal A journal is a good way to organize your thoughts, analyze your feelings, and make plans. And you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be a literary genius or write volumes to benefit. It can be as simple as jotting down a few thoughts before you go to bed. If putting certain things in writing makes you nervous, you can always shred it when you\xe2\x80\x99ve finished. It\xe2\x80\x99s the process that counts. Not sure what to do with all the feelings that end up on the page? Our guide to organizing your feelings can help. 10. Face stress head-on Life is full of stressors, and it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to avoid all of them. There\xe2\x80\x99s no need to. Stanford psychologist Kelly McGonigal says that stress isn\xe2\x80\x99t always harmful, and we can even change our attitudes about stress. Learn more about the upside of stress. For those stressors you can\xe2\x80\x99t avoid, remind yourself that everyone has stress \xe2\x80\x94 there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to think it\xe2\x80\x99s all on you. And chances are, you\xe2\x80\x99re stronger than you think you are. Instead of letting yourself get overwhelmed, try to tackle the stressor head-on. This might mean initiating an uncomfortable conversation or putting in some extra work, but the sooner you tackle it, the sooner the pit in your stomach will start to shrink.\n\nWeekly habits 11. Declutter Decluttering sounds like a big project, but setting aside just 20 minutes a week can have a big impact. What can you do in 20 minutes? Lots. Set a timer on your phone and take 15 minutes to tidy up a specific area of one room \xe2\x80\x94 say, your closet or that out-of-control junk drawer. Put everything in its place and toss or give away any extra clutter that\xe2\x80\x99s not serving you anymore. Keep a designated box for giveaways to make things a little easier (and avoid creating more clutter). Use the remaining 5 minutes to do a quick walk through your living space, putting away whatever stray items end up in your path. You can do this trick once a week, once a day, or anytime you feel like your space is getting out of control. 12. See friends Humans are social beings, and having close friends can make us happier. Who do you miss? Reach out to them. Make a date to get together or simply have a long phone chat. In adulthood, it can feel next to impossible to make new friends. But it\xe2\x80\x99s not about how many friends you have. It\xe2\x80\x99s about having meaningful relationships \xe2\x80\x94 even if it\xe2\x80\x99s just with one or\n\ntwo people. Try getting involved in a local volunteer group or taking a class. Both can help to connect you with like-minded people in your area. And chances are, they\xe2\x80\x99re looking for friends, too. Companionship doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be limited to other humans. Pets can offer similar benefits, according to multiple studies. Love animals but can\xe2\x80\x99t have a pet? Consider volunteering at a local animal shelter to make some new friends \xe2\x80\x94 both human and animal. 13. Plan your week Feel like you\xe2\x80\x99re flailing about? Try sitting down at the end of every week and making a basic list for the following week. Even if you don\xe2\x80\x99t stick to the plan, blocking out time where you can do laundry, go grocery shopping, or tackle projects at work can help to quiet your mind. You can get a fancy planner, but even a sticky note on your computer or piece of scrap paper in your pocket can do the job. 14. Ditch your phone Unplug. Really. Turn off all the electronics and put those ear buds away for at least one hour once a week. They\xe2\x80\x99ll still be there for you later. If you still want them, that is. If you haven\xe2\x80\x99t unplugged in a while, you might be surprised at the difference it makes. Let your mind wander free for a change. Read. Meditate. Take a walk and pay attention to your surroundings. Be sociable. Or be alone. Just be. Sound too daunting? Try doing a shorter amount of time several times a week. 15. Get into nature Spending 30 minutes or more a week in green spaces can help lower blood pressure and depression, according to a 2016 study . Your green space could be anything from your neighborhood park, your own backyard, or a rooftop garden \xe2\x80\x94 anywhere you can appreciate some nature and fresh air. Better yet, add some outdoor\n\nexercise into the mix for extra benefit. 16. Explore meditation There are many methods of meditation to explore. They can involve movement, focus, spirituality, or a combination of all three. Meditation doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be complicated. It can be as simple as sitting quietly with your own thoughts for 5 minutes. Even the deep breathing exercises mentioned earlier can serve as a form of meditation. 17. Consider therapy We\xe2\x80\x99re certainly happier when we learn how to cope with obstacles. When you\xe2\x80\x99re faced with a problem, think about what got you through something similar in the past. Would it work here? What else can you try? If you feel like you\xe2\x80\x99re hitting a brick wall, consider speaking with a therapist on a weekly basis. You don\xe2\x80\x99t need to have a diagnosed mental health condition or overwhelming crisis to seek therapy. Therapists are trained to help people improve coping skills. Plus, there\xe2\x80\x99s no obligation to continue once you start. Even just a few sessions can help you add some new goodies to your emotional toolbox. Worried about the cost? Here\xe2\x80\x99s how to afford therapy on any budget. 18. Find a self-care ritual It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to neglect self-care in a fast-paced world. But your body carries your thoughts, passions, and spirit through this world, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it deserve a little TLC? Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s unwinding your workweek with a long, hot bath. Or adopting a skin care routine that makes you feel indulgent. Or simply setting aside a night to put on your softest jammies and watch a movie from start to finish. Whatever it is, make time for it. Put it in your planner if you must, but do it.\n\nMonthly habits 19. Give back If you find that giving daily compliments provides a needed boost to your mood, considering making a monthly routine of giving back on a larger scale. Maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s helping out at a food bank on the third weekend of every month, or offering to watch your friend\xe2\x80\x99s kids one night per month. 20. Take yourself out No one to go out with? Well, what rule says you can\xe2\x80\x99t go out alone? Go to your favorite restaurant, take in a movie, or go on that trip you\xe2\x80\x99ve always dreamed of. Even if you\xe2\x80\x99re a social butterfly, spending some deliberate time alone can help you reconnect with the activities that truly make you happy. 21. Create a thought list You arrive for an appointment with 10 minutes to spare. What do you do with that time? Pick up your cell phone to scroll through social media? Worry about the busy week you have ahead of you? Take control of your thoughts during these brief windows of time. At the start of each month, make a short list of happy memories or things you\xe2\x80\x99re looking forward to on a small piece of paper or on your phone. When you find yourself waiting for a ride, standing in line at the grocery store, or just with a few minutes to kill, break out the list. You can even use it when you\xe2\x80\x99re just generally feeling down and need to change up your thoughts.'";"Other";"1049.txt-Other"
"105.txt";"b'Chocolate is the most popular sweet treat in the world. People around the world (but mostly in Europe and the United States) consume more than 3 million tons of cocoa beans a year, according to the World Cocoa Foundation. And, not only does eating chocolate make you feel good, it may also be good for your heart and your brain.\n\nWhat is chocolate?\n\nChocolate is prepared from the fruit of the Theobroma cacao, a tropical tree whose name means ""food of the gods"" in Greek, according to ""Chocolate: Food of the Gods,"" an online exhibit by the Cornell University Library.\n\nTheobroma cacao trees are native to the Amazon and Orinoco river basins in South America. The trees are widely distributed from southeastern Mexico to the Amazon River. They thrive in hot, humid areas within about 20 degrees of the equator, according to Cornell. As the popularity of chocolate spread, growers established plantations in other regions, such as West Africa and South and Southeast Asia. Today, Ghana, C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire, Nigeria, Indonesia and Brazil account for 79 percent of the world\'s cacao production.\n\nCacao trees bear fruit that are about the same size and shape of a papaya, according to Patric Chocolate. These bumpy, lumpy berries, or pods, are full of up to 50 sour seeds, or beans, covered in white pulp.\n\nCacao seeds are harvested by hand because machines could injure the trees, according to Cornell. Workers remove the pods, which are orange when they are ripe, and open them with a machete. The seeds are placed in large fermentation trays that are stacked and covered in banana leaves, where they are left for two to seven days. Fermentation produces the chocolate flavor and aroma. It also destroys the seed\'s embryo, preventing unwanted germination, and causes the white pulp to fall away from the seeds.\n\nAfter fermenting, the beans dry out on sunny platforms. Workers turn them several times a day for three to five days to complete drying. The beans can dry faster in rotary driers but sun-dried beans taste the best, according to Cornell.\n\nNext, the beans are taken to the chocolate factory, where they are cleaned and debris is removed. The beans are roasted in large, rotating ovens. The roasting draws out flavor and removes the beans from their hulls. Roasted beans go into a winnowing machine, which cracks the beans and removes hulls. The remaining part of the bean is called the nib. Nibs become chocolate.\n\nThe nibs are ground down under a series of rollers. This process results in a thick paste called chocolate liquor. Chocolate liquor does not contain alcohol (however, chocolate liqueur does). It is the main source of unsweetened baking chocolate, according to Pam Williams, co-founder and past president of the Fine Chocolate Industry Association (FCIA) and founder and lead instructor of Ecole Cocolat Professional School of Chocolate Arts.\n\nAt this stage, the type of chocolate being produced is determined. According to the FCIA, ingredients separate fine chocolate from that of average quality. ""Fine chocolate,"" as designated by the FCIA, contains only cacao liquor, cacao butter (optional), sugar, lecithin, vanilla (optional) and possibly milk fats and solids. Additional flavors or ingredients like nuts can be added later.\n\n(Image credit: Dreamstime)\n\nTypes of chocolate\n\nFine chocolate falls into three categories: dark chocolate, milk chocolate and white chocolate, Williams said.\n\nDark chocolate has chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, lecithin, sugar and vanilla.\n\nMilk chocolate has all of the above plus milk fats and milk solids.\n\nWhite chocolate contains everything milk chocolate does except chocolate liquor.\n\nChocolatiers debate whether white chocolate is really chocolate. Until 2002, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration considered it a confectionary rather than chocolate because it does not contain chocolate liquor. The Hershey Food Corp. and the Chocolate Manufacturers Association petitioned the FDA, which added a standard of identity for white chocolate. Because the FDA refers to it as white chocolate, rather than confectionary, some experts, like Williams, accept white chocolate as chocolate.\n\nWithin the three categories, the FDA also acknowledges several grades, Williams said. They include unsweetened or brute, which can be up to 99 percent chocolate liquor; bittersweet; semisweet; and dark milk chocolate. The type of chocolate depends on what ingredients are present and the percentage of cocoa, in addition to where the beans are from and the way they are prepared.\n\nHealth benefits of chocolate\n\nGood heart food\n\nSeveral recent studies have examined the role that chocolate may have on heart health. Cacao beans are full of phytonutrients, which act as antioxidants and provide additional benefits. Furthermore, cacao beans are rich sources of iron, copper, magnesium, zinc and phosphorus, according to the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Dark chocolate contains two to three times more beneficial flavanols than milk chocolate because milk chocolate\'s cacao concentration is diluted with milk and possibly more sugar.\n\nWhile most studies have found some correlation between chocolate consumption and reduced risk of heart problems, the amount and type of chocolate needed requires further study. A 2017 meta-analysis of the effects of chocolate on coronary heart disease, stroke and diabetes published in the journal Nutrients concluded that the most benefit was associated with moderate chocolate intake. The authors found little benefit in heart disease or stroke reduction among people who consumed chocolate more than three times a week. Protective effects against diabetes emerged at two servings a week, but that benefit disappeared if people had more than six servings a week.\n\nOn the other hand, the findings of a large-scale study of more than 150,000 primarily male U.S. veterans who did not have coronary artery disease at the beginning of the study, suggest that eating an ounce of chocolate at least five times a week may help prevent the risk of coronary artery disease-related events like heart attack and heart failure.\n\nChocolate may also help prevent the development of atrial fibrillation, a type of irregular heartbeat that increases the risk of heart failure, stroke and more. A study, published in the journal Heart in 2017, found that adults who ate chocolate at least once a month had 10 to 20 percent lower rates of developing atrial fibrillation than those who never or rarely ate chocolate.\n\nGood brain food\n\nChocolate may be good for the brain. Some studies have focused on chocolate\'s ability to improve cognitive function. A study published in the Journal of Alzheimer\'s Disease in 2016 found that chocolate consumption might lower the risk of cognitive decline in older people. The study looked at nearly 400 Portuguese citizens over age 65 and saw that those who ate a moderate amount of chocolate \xe2\x80\x94 on average, one chocolate snack a week; the study did not differentiate between milk and dark chocolate \xe2\x80\x94 decreased their risk of cognitive decline by 40 percent over two years. Those who ate more chocolate, or those who had more caffeine, saw fewer cognitive benefits.\n\nGood mood food\n\nChocolate is often associated with positive effects on mood, but the reasons why it makes some people feel good are debatable. Chocolate contains substances that stimulate the brain in the same way cannabis does, such as anandamines, and substances that have similar effects as amphetamine, such as tyramine and phenylethylamine, according to the Dartmouth Undergraduate Journal of Science. However, these substances are in very low concentrations \xe2\x80\x94 too low to induce an antidepressant effect.\n\nChocolate may interact with neurotransmitter systems that contribute to appetite, reward and mood regulation, such as dopamine, serotonin and endorphins, according to the 2013 article in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology. However, the authors noted, the effects may have more to do with chocolate\'s taste and smell than its chemical effects.\n\nA 2010 study published in Archives of Internal Medicine found a link between depression and chocolate consumption. The results showed that people who scored high on a screening test for depression consumed more chocolate than those who weren\'t considered depressed. However, the study pointed out that there is only a link, and cannot explain why. Since the participants were not followed over time, the researchers don\'t know whether eating chocolate ameliorates or amplifies a sad mood. The possibilities are many \xe2\x80\x94 from using chocolate as a sort of natural Prozac to the idea that chocolate might have some role in driving depression.\n\nHealth risks of eating chocolate\n\nLike many foods, chocolate is healthiest when eaten in moderation. The sugars and fats that are added to chocolate make it high in calories, which may lead to weight gain. Furthermore, many of the protective effects that chocolate may offer might be mitigated by overconsumption.\n\nHistory of chocolate\n\nScientists debate how long humans have been using and consuming cacao beans. Chocolate\'s history goes back at least 2,000 years, while historians Sophie and Michael Coe, authors of ""The True History of Chocolate"" (Thames and Hudson, 2013), suggest that it might go back four millennia. The word chocolate can be traced back to the Aztec word ""xocoatl,"" the name for a bitter drink made from cacao beans. This was the way chocolate was consumed until the Spanish conquistadors came to Central America.\n\nIn several pre-Columbian Latin American societies, cacao beans were used as currency, according to Smithsonian magazine. Mayans and Aztecs believed the beans had mystical properties and used them during important rituals. When the Spanish arrived, sweetened chocolate came into existence. Legend has it that the Aztec king Montezuma gave conquistador Hern\xc3\xa1n Cort\xc3\xa9s a bitter chocolate drink, which he said was disgusting. But Cort\xc3\xa9s\' men added cane sugar and honey to it and took it back to Spain, where it quickly became popular.\n\nChocolate was a fashionable drink for rich Europeans throughout the 18th century. The Industrial Revolution allowed chocolate to be mass-produced and brought the treat to the masses. The popularity led to the development of cacao tree plantations.\n\nEnslaved people farmed most of the plantations. Initially, Spanish colonizers forced Mesoamericans to farm the cacao plantations, according to ""The Biography of Chocolate"" (Crabtree Publishing Co., 2005), by Adrianna Morganelli. When the indigenous peoples began to die in large numbers from diseases brought by Europeans, enslaved Africans were brought over to make up the labor shortage. In addition to sugarcane, indigo and other crops, enslaved Africans planted, maintained and harvested cacao trees throughout the Caribbean, Central and South America to feed the new European taste for chocolate.\n\nIn 1815, Dutch physicist Coenraad Van Houten experimented with removing varied amounts of the cocoa butter from chocolate liquor, according to Cornell University. This led to the creation of cocoa powder and soon solid chocolate.\n\nIn 1847, a Bristol, England, chocolate company, Fry\'s, created the first mass-produced chocolate bar when Joseph Fry added additional cocoa butter to Van Houten\'s chocolate, which turned it into a moldable paste, according to Bristol Museums. Milk chocolate was invented soon after with the help of Henri Nestl\xc3\xa9, who went on to found the major food company that bears his name. Major European chocolate brands Lindt and Cadbury also got their start in the 1800s; Rodolphe Lindt invented the conching machine, which gives chocolate a velvety texture.\n\nMass chocolate consumption hit the United States in the late 1800s when Milton S. Hershey began selling chocolate-coated caramels. He then developed his own formula for milk chocolate, purchased chocolate factory equipment and introduced mass-produced chocolate bars and other shapes, like Hershey\'s Kisses, in 1900.\n\nIn 1923, the Mars Co. developed the Milky Way bar by putting nougat inside a chocolate bar. That same year, former Hershey employee H.B. Reese introduced Reese\'s Peanut Butter Cups, which later became part of the Hershey brand.\n\nAs the years progressed, chocolate concoctions from both small and large producers became increasingly innovative. In September 2017, Swiss chocolate company Barry Callebaut introduced ruby chocolate. Ruby chocolate comes from isolating specific compounds in cocoa beans, according to Confectionary News. That, along with a modified processing technique, results in a rosy pink chocolate that has a sweet but sour berry taste and no traditional chocolate flavor, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. Other colored chocolates are made from dyed white chocolate.\n\nThreats to chocolate\n\nChocolate production is threatened by climate change. According to a 2016 report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the primary cacao-producing countries of C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire, Ghana, and Indonesia will experience a 2.1 degree Celsius (3.7 degrees Fahrenheit) increase in temperature by 2050. Rainfall will not rise along with the temperature, causing lowered humidity levels. As a result, viable land for cacao production will significantly shrink. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\'s Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability report, 89.5 percent of the 294 chocolate-producing locations studied would become less suitable by 2050.\n\nFarmers and scientists are working to develop strategies to maintain chocolate production. Some farmers are planting taller trees next to cacao trees to increase shade and decrease moisture loss, according to the NOAA. Cacao plantations may also move to higher elevations with cooler temperatures and greater rainfall.\n\nGenetic scientists are taking a different approach. A January 2018 press release from the Innovative Genomics Institute announced a project to develop disease-resistant cacao. Condensing cacao plantations because of climate change could increase the spread of disease. The project will use CRISPR DNA-editing technology to make a heartier cacao seed.\n\nEthics of chocolate production\n\nAccording to Slave Free Chocolate, 2.3 million children work in chocolate production in Ghana and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire, where they are vulnerable to trafficking, slavery and other violent labor practices. The International Labor Rights Forum reports that these children are often exposed to chemicals, work long hours and are denied education. According to Epicure and Culture, many children are sold into slavery and never see their families again. Others are kidnapped.\n\nThough the Harkin-Engel Protocol of 2001 was designed to stop child labor in the chocolate industry, according to the CNN Freedom Project, little has changed. The deadlines for action have been repeatedly pushed back.\n\nConsumers who want ethical chocolate should look for certifications designating Fair Trade, Rain Forest Alliance, UTZ, and Fair for Life, according to Slave Free Chocolate\xe2\x80\x99s guide to chocolate companies.\n\nChocolate production can also harm the environment. Farmers often clear forests to make room for cacao plantations. According to the World Wildlife Fund, about 70 percent of C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire\'s illegal deforestation is related to cacao farming. One danger of deforestation is soil erosion, which can make land less fertile for cacao plants, creating a vicious cycle, according to Confectionary News.\n\nAdditional resources'";"Other";"105.txt-Other"
"1055.txt";"b'\xe2\x80\x9cHow to Build a Life\xe2\x80\x9d is a weekly column by Arthur Brooks, tackling questions of meaning and happiness.\n\nEvery year, Gallup asks a sample of American adults what might seem to be a rather loaded question: How much do you like your job? The results may surprise you. The portion who say they are \xe2\x80\x9ccompletely satisfied\xe2\x80\x9d at work has risen dramatically over the past two decades, from 41 percent in 2001 to 55 percent in 2019. In 2020, despite the fact that millions of Americans had shifted to remote work, 89 percent said they were either \xe2\x80\x9ccompletely\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9csomewhat\xe2\x80\x9d satisfied.\n\nI teach graduate students who have carefully envisioned their ideal career, many of whom are training to enter jobs in business or government. They find this statistic surprising because, like so many of us, they generally assume that to be satisfied, you must hold your dream job\xe2\x80\x94one where your skills meet your passions, you make good money, and you are excited to get to work each day. No way 89 percent of people have this, right?\n\nBut this belief is based on a misunderstanding of what brings job satisfaction. To be happy at work, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to hold a fascinating job that represents the pinnacle of your educational achievement or the most prestigious use of your \xe2\x80\x9cpotential,\xe2\x80\x9d and you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to make a lot of money. What matters is not so much the \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x9d of a job, but more the \xe2\x80\x9cwho\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cwhy\xe2\x80\x9d: Job satisfaction comes from people, values, and a sense of accomplishment.\n\nNo doubt a substantial chunk of the job-satisfaction percentage is due to the fact that having any job at all makes people happier. Unemployment is one of the biggest sources of unhappiness people can face. Using data from the General Social Survey, I found that American adults who reported that they were \xe2\x80\x9cvery\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cfairly\xe2\x80\x9d likely to lose their job in 2018 were more than three times more likely to say they were \xe2\x80\x9cnot too happy\xe2\x80\x9d with their life than people who felt they were \xe2\x80\x9cnot likely\xe2\x80\x9d to be let go. Several studies have linked a country\xe2\x80\x99s unemployment level with suicide-rate increases. In 2014, economists found that a one-percentage-point increase in unemployment lowers national well-being by more than five times as much as a one-point increase in the inflation rate.\n\nWhen one has a job, the factors that most affect satisfaction have little to do with the line of work. First, there are the uncontrollable variables: One study in the Journal of Applied Psychology of identical twins reared apart found that about 30 percent of job satisfaction is genetic. Then, there are the practical variables: Economists have found that wage increases raise job satisfaction, but only in the short term. The effect decays quickly as time passes. In all careers, regular wage increases are better for happiness than infrequent, larger raises.\n\nRead: The new economics of happiness\n\nSome of the squishiest aspects of a job are also the ones that make it most rewarding: the values held by your company and your co-workers. Research has shown, for example, that all over the world job satisfaction depends on a sense of accomplishment, recognition for a job well done, and work-life balance. Teamwork, too, has a strong influence in collectivist cultures, but less so in individualist ones. The late Harvard psychologist Richard Hackman found that job satisfaction was strongly, inversely tied to leader-centricity: In one of his studies, musicians who worked in symphony orchestras, where many conductors rule with an iron fist, were 21 percent less satisfied with their growth opportunities than players in leaderless string quartets.\n\nDecades of studies have shown that the people most satisfied with their work are those who find a fundamental match between their employer\xe2\x80\x99s values and their own. This is especially true when the values have special moral, philosophical, or spiritual significance. For example, a 2012 study on Iranian nurses found that the happiest ones believed their work was \xe2\x80\x9ca divine profession and a tool by which they could gain spiritual pleasure and satisfaction.\xe2\x80\x9d Many of my colleagues feel the same way about the vocation of higher education, and as the late philosopher Michael Novak wrote, that sense of a calling can be found in business as well.\n\nRead: Four rules for identifying your life\xe2\x80\x99s work\n\nResearchers who have looked for clear relationships between job satisfaction and the actual type of job one holds have overwhelmingly struck out. CareerBliss, a company dedicated to helping people find greater happiness at work, has published survey results of the \xe2\x80\x9chappiest jobs\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cunhappiest jobs,\xe2\x80\x9d as rated by those who hold them. Its most recent rankings, from 2018, show the happiest jobs to be quite disparate: teaching assistant, quality-assurance analyst, net developer, marketing specialist. The unhappiest jobs are similarly grab-baggy, and fairly unrelated to education and income: accountant, security guard, cashier, supervisor.\n\nWhen my graduate students ask me for advice on choosing a job or career path, I don\xe2\x80\x99t tell them to find the best possible fit between their interests and specific job duties. Obviously, they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t sign up for something they hate. But I tell them that satisfaction can be found in all sorts of vocations. After all, how many kids say, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I grow up, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be a quality-assurance analyst\xe2\x80\x9d? Rather than relentlessly pursuing a \xe2\x80\x9cperfect match\xe2\x80\x9d career that they\xe2\x80\x99re sure will make them happy, a better approach is to remain flexible on the exact job, while searching for the values and culture that fit with theirs.\n\nWhatever job they end up in, finding a sense of accomplishment within it is crucial for job satisfaction. It helps to set goals in one\xe2\x80\x99s work, such as increasing skills or responsibility. Some goals lead to more happiness than others, however. While pay increases push up satisfaction temporarily, money as a career goal does not. Volumes of research show that pursuing extrinsic rewards for work, such as money, actually hurts your interest in that work. For real satisfaction, you should pursue intrinsic goals\xe2\x80\x94two in particular.\n\nRead: Are you dreaming too big?\n\nThe first is earned success. You can think of it as the opposite of learned helplessness, a term coined by the psychologist Martin Seligman to denote the resignation that people experience when they repeatedly endure unpleasant situations beyond their control. Earned success instead gives you a sense of accomplishment (which Seligman has shown is a source of happiness, and which strongly predicts happiness at work) and professional efficacy (the idea that you are effective in your job, which pushes up commitment to your occupation, also a good measure of job satisfaction). Employers who give clear guidance and feedback, reward merit, and encourage their employees to develop new skills are the most likely to give you those feelings. Look for a boss who acts that way\xe2\x80\x94and if you have the opportunity, be that kind of boss.\n\nThe second goal worth pursuing at work is service to others\xe2\x80\x94the sense that your job is making the world a better place. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean you need to volunteer or work for a charity to be happy (my own research has shown that nonprofit work is not more inherently satisfying than working for a for-profit or for the government). On the contrary, you can find service in almost any job. One of my students made this point better than I can, in an op-ed he wrote to explain why he had forgone jobs in his field of academic study to become a waiter in Barcelona. As he put it in Spanish, his customers \xe2\x80\x9care all important and equal. They are the same at the table and must be the same in the eyes of the waiter \xe2\x80\xa6 It\xe2\x80\x99s great to be able to serve the politician on the front page of the newspaper just as well as the kid browsing the news while waiting for his girlfriend.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nGiven that job satisfaction depends on fairly amorphous criteria such as people and values instead of concrete characteristics such as job duties and money, it\xe2\x80\x99s worth noting that a good job can become a bad one without any changes that would be obvious to an outsider.\n\nFrom the April 2016 issue: Quit your job\n\nOne of the most famous examples of this comes from the first story in the Bible. In the second chapter of the Book of Genesis, God\xe2\x80\x94who had recently created Adam and deemed his creation \xe2\x80\x9cvery good\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94gives Adam a blessed vocation that pleases both of them: He \xe2\x80\x9cput him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it.\xe2\x80\x9d One chapter later, after the unpleasantness with the snake and the apple, God casts Adam and Eve out of Eden, cursing them: \xe2\x80\x9cBy the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the ground.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe research above sheds some light on all of this: Adam and Eve were still farmers in both cases, but you might say their relationship with the boss had soured, and they went from earning their success to dragging themselves to work to pay the bills.\n\nFrom the July 2019 issue: Your professional decline is coming (much) sooner than you think\n\nOkay, saying that job dissatisfaction is the price of the fall of man might be a little much, but it is pretty bad. And while a good job might not be quite as idyllic as the Garden of Eden, when we know the secrets to a career that is truly satisfying, work really can be a joy.'";"Other";"1055.txt-Other"

Here\xe2\x80\x99s the latest on what\xe2\x80\x99s happening with the coronavirus in California and beyond.\n\nNewsletter Get our free Coronavirus Today newsletter Sign up for the latest news, best stories and what they mean for you, plus answers to your questions. Enter email address Sign Me Up You may occasionally receive promotional content from the Los Angeles Times.\n\nAs we head into Labor Day weekend, we bring you the tale of two tireless entrepreneurs with a bona fide pandemic hit on their hands.\n\nBut since the coronavirus has a way of flipping everything on its head, theirs isn\xe2\x80\x99t entirely a success story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe pair in question are Melinda Hwang and Ed Fu, the West L.A. couple behind Happy Masks. Their $24 face coverings are all the rage, especially among parents whose kids are old enough to be going back to school but are too young to get vaccinated. Indeed, masks sized for children account for about 80% of the company\xe2\x80\x99s runaway sales.\n\nHwang is a graduate of MIT\xe2\x80\x99s Sloan School of Management and the former marketing director of Capital Group, an investment management firm. Fu has a degree from Harvard Business School and served as chief marketing officer of ZipRecruiter, a hiring website. Despite their credentials, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t set out to create a mask business.\n\nThe masks were developed in Taiwan by a scientist who collaborated with Hwang\xe2\x80\x99s father on a new type of filter for wastewater treatment. The 2003 SARS outbreak prompted the scientist to adapt the filter for use in masks, and when COVID-19 burst onto the scene in 2020, he shared some with friends and family.\n\nHwang, Fu and their three young children wore the masks around their neighborhood. Wearers find that the masks, with a design reminiscent of a parrot\xe2\x80\x99s beak, make it easier to speak and breathe without fogging up one\xe2\x80\x99s glasses. Sewn inside is a nano-fiber membrane filter capable of blocking particles as small as 3 micrometers. (A micrometer is 10,000 times smaller than a centimeter.)\n\nFor the record: An earlier version of this newsletter said a micrometer was only 100 times smaller than a centimeter.\n\nThe masks attracted attention, and soon Hwang was asking her parents if she could get extras for friends, neighbors and other acquaintances. As requests poured in, she realized she had the makings of a business.\n\nHappy Masks founders Melinda Hwang and husband Ed Fu have seen their company\xe2\x80\x99s face coverings become a back-to-school sensation.\n\n(Gary Coronado / Los Angeles Times)\n\nThe masks were in demand from the start. Hwang\xe2\x80\x99s first callout to parents in a Facebook group for one of her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s classes generated orders for more than 1,000 masks.\n\nAfter receiving a glowing online review that said Happy Masks \xe2\x80\x9cfiltered small particles better than many other masks,\xe2\x80\x9d customers bought up the entire inventory.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe harder the masks were to find, the more popular they became. When a new allotment of masks went on sale Aug. 9, about 16,000 would-be customers swarmed the site \xe2\x80\x94 and 90% of them left empty-handed. The same thing happened three days later.\n\nNikki Hart, a mother of two in Culver City, put three masks in her cart within seconds of the Aug. 9 sale getting underway. But by the time she hit the purchase button, her selections were out of stock.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt felt like I was trying to get tickets to the Rolling Stones,\xe2\x80\x9d Hart said.\n\nYou might think this was a good problem for a new company to have. But you\xe2\x80\x99d feel differently if you were fielding hundreds of emails from an angry and frustrated public. Some disgruntled parents posted complaints on Instagram; one critic called Happy Masks \xe2\x80\x9ca marketing scam.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome of the most anguish-inducing messages came from the parents of immunocompromised children, she said.\n\nHwang said the situation left her feeling like she\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x9clet everyone down.\xe2\x80\x9d At one point, she said, the stress caused her to \xe2\x80\x9cburst into tears.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nShe and Fu have experimented with different ways of allocating masks among customers, with some success. But there will be kinks to work out until they can ramp up their production without sacrificing quality.\n\nPlenty of customers are willing to wait. They want to experience the joy of Laura Gaskill, a mother of two in Naperville, Ill., who has purchased 25 Happy Masks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no higher praise than your 6-year-old wearing a mask all day and forgetting he has it on,\xe2\x80\x9d Gaskill said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve been so grateful to have a little bit of control over something as completely chaotic as COVID.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBy the numbers\n\nCalifornia cases, deaths and vaccinations as of 1:30 p.m. on Friday:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrack California\xe2\x80\x99s coronavirus spread and vaccination efforts \xe2\x80\x94 including the latest numbers and how they break down \xe2\x80\x94 with our graphics.\n\nAnother way the pandemic makes everything harder\n\nCleaning up from a Category 4 hurricane is challenging under any circumstances. But for the people displaced by Ida, which made landfall in Louisiana this week, the pandemic just makes everything even harder.\n\nHospitals that could have been focused on treating storm victims were already brimming with COVID-19 patients. Once the storm hit, the best-equipped medical centers struggled to keep ventilators and other essential machinery functioning on backup generators. Other hospitals had to evacuate their fragile patients.\n\nThree dozen shelters around the state took in nearly 2,000 people displaced by the storm. They struggled to take pandemic precautions, like encouraging masking and social distancing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt one shelter in LaPlace near New Orleans, only one of the two sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s deputies sitting behind a counter wore a face covering. Behavior like that made Dontrell Riley nervous. She opted to take her four children out to the sidewalk rather than wait inside.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI just hope we stay safe and don\xe2\x80\x99t catch COVID,\xe2\x80\x9d Riley said, nudging a blue surgical mask to cover her nose. \xe2\x80\x9cI seen a lot of people here, and I know it\xe2\x80\x99s dangerous.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDemetrice Joseph, left, waits with her family at a makeshift dropoff center in LaPlace, La., after a boat rescued them from their flooded home. (Jennie Jarvie / Los Angeles Times)\n\nDemetrice Joseph also felt safer outside, especially since she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to grab a mask when she left her waterlogged home. Nor did she see any masks at the shelter when she lined up to check in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t want to catch it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said as she and several relatives kept their distance from a growing crowd of evacuees, most not wearing masks. Joseph was particularly concerned about her mother, who has asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. \xe2\x80\x9cMy mom shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be around that many people.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLouisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards spoke forcefully about the COVID-19 threat. In recent weeks, the state \xe2\x80\x94 which has one of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s lowest COVID-19 vaccination rates \xe2\x80\x94 was logging more than 5,000 new coronavirus cases per day.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhether we like it or not, we are still in a COVID environment; it is a very difficult COVID environment, where 100% of our cases are attributable to this Delta variant,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cEverything we\xe2\x80\x99re doing needs to be done with COVID in mind, so it\xe2\x80\x99s important we mask and wash hands and do all of these things to the maximum extent possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThat message apparently didn\xe2\x80\x99t impress Cain Dufrene, the chief of operations for St. John the Baptist Parish Fire Services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be honest with you. ... We really didn\xe2\x80\x99t take too many COVID protocols,\xe2\x80\x9d he said after pulling a 30-hour shift. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re going to save the life rather than trying to worry too much about the COVID stuff.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLike many of the local officials and emergency workers huddled inside the St. John command center, Dufrene did not wear a mask.\n\nCalifornia\xe2\x80\x99s vaccination progress\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSee the latest on California\xe2\x80\x99s vaccination progress with our tracker .\n\nConsider subscribing to the Los Angeles Times Your support helps us deliver the news that matters most.

Health Care Agency formally briefed the Board of Supervisors on the pandemic at one of its public meetings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn L.A. County, the Department of Public Health recently increased the frequency of live COVID-19 press briefings to twice a week. In the O.C., such briefings were suspended for several months.\n\nSupervisor Katrina Foley, a former mayor of Costa Mesa, was concerned that O.C. residents were not getting the facts they needed to combat the rampant misinformation they might be hearing about COVID-19, vaccines and the Delta variant. So on Aug. 9, she launched her own regular COVID-19 news conference.\n\nThe briefings were initially held five days a week, though they\xe2\x80\x99ve dropped in frequency to twice a week. They feature county health officials and other experts, who warned the public that local hospitals were beginning to strain under the Delta surge. They also gave updates on conditions in schools, explained why it\xe2\x80\x99s important to wear masks and offered tips on maximizing safety over the Labor Day weekend.\n\nBut on Thursday, the chair and vice chair of the Board of Supervisors ordered county officials to stop participating in Foley\xe2\x80\x99s briefings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoard Chairman Andrew Do called them political stunts that repeated information already available elsewhere. The Orange County Health Care Agency resumed its own weekly press briefings Aug. 13 \xe2\x80\x94 after Foley\xe2\x80\x99s news conferences had begun.\n\nFoley said she\xe2\x80\x99d continue hosting the briefings without county health officials if necessary. She could try to replace them with experts from the state Department of Public Health. She already features doctors from local hospitals, epidemiologists and other healthcare professionals.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re just trying to give accurate health information out to the community,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think the information that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been sharing has caused more people to question some of the misinformation that\xe2\x80\x99s coming out.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFarther south, officials in San Diego County voted this week to declare medical misinformation a public health crisis \xe2\x80\x94 the first county in the country to do so.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Board of Supervisors took the vote after a 15-hour meeting that included eight hours of public comments, much of it critical of vaccine and mask mandates. The three Democratic supervisors voted in favor of the measure, while the two Republican supervisors voted against it.\n\nSupervisor Nathan Fletcher said the measure was necessary to ensure that false and misleading statements don\xe2\x80\x99t get in the way of doctors\xe2\x80\x99 and nurses\xe2\x80\x99 efforts to treat a rising tide of COVID-19 patients. The Republicans, Jim Desmond and Joel Anderson, said that although they support vaccination efforts, they consider it government overreach to try to referee debate about the pandemic.\n\nSpeaking of vaccines, the L.A. Community College District Board of Trustees has voted to require them for all staff members \xe2\x80\x94 even those working remotely \xe2\x80\x94 and for students attending in-person classes or using campus facilities.\n\nThe vote to revise the policy \xe2\x80\x94 which previously called for either a COVID-19 vaccination or regular coronavirus testing \xe2\x80\x94 is linked to the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s official approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for people 16 and older. It passed 7-1, with trustee Ernest Moreno voting no.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMedical and religious exemptions will be allowed. Those exempted will be required to get tested at least once a week.\n\nIn national news, the Delta variant has thrown us an economic curveball that prompted employers to add just 235,000 new jobs to their payrolls last month. That\xe2\x80\x99s one-third as many as most forecasters were expecting based on hiring trends earlier in the summer. Retail stores and restaurants and drinking places shed jobs last month.\n\nWith Delta walloping unvaccinated Americans and causing problems for groups that had seemed relatively unaffected by earlier strains, the wave of consumer spending that had propelled the recovery has faltered. Many businesses are reconsidering plans to return to their normal operations.\n\nWithout some kind of government action, \xe2\x80\x9cI think the rosy scenario for this fall becomes really dark, really fast,\xe2\x80\x9d said William Spriggs, chief economist for the AFL-CIO, the labor organization.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe employment news comes as the federal government ends four temporary programs that were designed to help those who were unemployed or underemployed weather the pandemic. Those programs were providing more than $1 billion in aid to about 2.2 million Californians as of late August, according to the state Employment Development Department.\n\nGone will be $300 in weekly unemployment benefits that the feds were offering on top of the state\xe2\x80\x99s unemployment insurance. Also disappearing is $839 million in help for gig workers, self-employed people and others who aren\xe2\x80\x99t eligible for unemployment benefits.\n\nAs things stand, the situation will soon get worse: On Sept. 11, the 13- to 20-week extension of federal unemployment benefits will end. At that point, the maximum duration of benefits will be 26 weeks, and those who have already hit that mark will be cut off.\n\nYour questions answered\n\nToday\xe2\x80\x99s question comes from readers who want to know: What is the coronavirus situation in my child\xe2\x80\x99s school?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf your child is a student in L.A.

The 10-day gathering occurred despite warnings about the highly contagious Delta variant and drew more than half a million people.\n\nExperts feared the rally would become a superspreader event. It looks like they were right.\n\nContact tracers have tied at least 178 coronavirus cases to the event. Those cases are from five states: South Dakota, North Dakota, Wyoming, Minnesota and Wisconsin.

Announcement.\n\nHappy is a parser generator system for Haskell, similar to the tool `yacc' for C. Like `yacc', it takes a file containing an annotated BNF specification of a grammar and produces a Haskell module containing a parser for the grammar.\n\nHappy is flexible: you can have several Happy parsers in the same program, and several entry points to a single grammar. Happy can work in conjunction with a lexical analyser supplied by the user (either hand-written or generated by another program), or it can parse a stream of characters directly (but this isn't practical in most cases).\n\nAs of version 1.5, Happy is capable of parsing full Haskell. We have a Haskell parser that uses Happy, which will shortly be part of the library collection distributed with GHC.\n\nHappy is part of the Haskell Platform, so if you install the platform you will automatically have a working Happy.\n\nHappy is also on Hackage. If you have the cabal-install tool (which also comes with the Haskell Platform), then you can build and install the latest version of Happy with\n\ncabal install happy\n\nTo find out what the latest version of Happy is, and to download the source separately, go to Happy's HackageDB page.\n\nHappy might also be pre-packaged for your OS:\n\nUbuntu users: packages should be available from the universe repository.\n\nDebian GNU/Linux users: packages are available here\n\nRPMs for other versions of Linux can be built directly from the source, using rpmbuild -ta .\n\n. FreeBSD/x86 users: Happy is in the ports tree, so either pkg_add -r hs-happy , or install it from the ports tree in /usr/ports/devel/hs-happy .\n\n, or install it from the ports tree in .

Through my work in the industry, I\'ve had the opportunity to see, experience, and purchase more rarefied and unique timepieces than I could ever have dreamed of. But to my surprise, my tastes have evolved a lot over the past decade and a half. Many of the watches I\'ve covered in this column\xe2\x80\x94the Submariners, the Royal Oaks, and the Speedmasters of the world\xe2\x80\x94remain close to my heart. But gone is the urge to stunt on Instagram (been there, done that). I don\'t even send braggy wrist shots of great complications or mega-mint vintage watches to friends anymore. Now I find myself seeking out watches that fall into one of two categories: pieces that have a story to tell and pieces that simply make me feel happy every time I put them on.\n\nI spent the summer of 2021 wearing a Unimatic diver by the pool and a Swatch Sistem 51 everywhere else. Combined, they cost less than a single spare pusher of a \xe2\x80\x9cBig Red\xe2\x80\x9d Daytona, and yet they brought me as much joy as any hype-y watch I own. It\'s this experience that made me fall in love with Parchie, a brand-new line of timepieces for children conceived and built by former Hodinkee editor Cara Barrett. The idea is to encourage young people to tell time in an analog way, but the straps will fit well beyond one\'s primary school days. Wearing mine truly makes me feel like a kid again. (Oh, and the watches contain a Japanese-made movement and cost only $50.) The brand officially launched in July, and I expect that a lot of parents will want to buy Parchies that match their children\'s, which to me is so much more exciting than treating timepieces as heirlooms meant to be passed down.\n\nAnd then there\'s my battle-scarred Omega Seamaster 300. The crystal is so scuffed you can barely see the circled T on the dial, which connotes that it was issued by the British military for official service. (It still has the sweat-stained NATO strap that came with the original.) Built under the same contract that the six-figure Rolex \xe2\x80\x9cMilSub\xe2\x80\x9d was, it has the same bezel, hands style, and fixed spring bars as the Sub, but it\'s decidedly not fancy. This particular piece was issued as a true tool for a clearance diver in 1967, and it was used, perhaps even abused, in service of a higher purpose. It\'s real, and the person who wore it with courage and esteem for decades before I acquired it was real. The stories it could tell are so much more meaningful to me than any tale of skipping a wait list for yet another luxury watch. And that\'s what gets me excited today. It\'s no longer about what is the rarest or most difficult to acquire\xe2\x80\x94watch collecting for me now is about having fun and celebrating the moments when watches were tools, not trophies of access.\n\nThis is the last piece in Ben\'s yearlong tour of duty as our watch columnist.

But you needn\'t be divine to indulge. Mere mortals adore chocolate in all its forms, from the humble chocolate chip cookie to gourmet goodies, wintry hot chocolate, and decadent desserts. And to make chocolate even more drool-worthy, researchers are discovering this ancient treat may have some modern health benefits.\n\nQ: When was chocolate first discovered?\n\nA: Chocolate dates back centuries. The Mayans traded valuable cacao beans, from which chocolate is made, as a commodity. In 1519, the Aztecs discovered that they could make a delicious drink by adding water and sweeteners to roasted, ground-up cacao beans. The chocolate bar came along later in the 18th century, by mixing chocolate with milk.\n\nQ: Are all chocolates good for you?\n\nA: Chocolate lovers, rejoice -- but be savvy about chocolate\'s health perks. Chocolate really can be good for you, but not all chocolate is created equally. If you\'re after health benefits, forget the chewy, caramel, marshmallow or cream-covered chocolates and look for solid dark chocolate.'";"Other";"11.txt-Other"
"111.txt";"b'The history of chocolate can be traced back more than 3,000 years to the Maya, Toltec, and Aztec people who prepared a beverage from the fruit of the cocoa bean. The Maya considered chocolate to be the food of the gods, held the cacao tree to be sacred, and buried dignitaries with bowls of chocolate.\n\nFull Article\n\nchocolate , food product made from cocoa beans , consumed as candy and used to make beverages and to flavour or coat various confections and bakery products. Rich in carbohydrates , it is an excellent source of quick energy, and it also contains minute amounts of the stimulating alkaloids theobromine and caffeine .\n\nHistory of chocolate\n\nThe cacao tree was cultivated more than 3,000 years ago by the Maya, Toltec, and Aztec peoples, who prepared a beverage from its fruit, the cocoa bean (sometimes using it as a ceremonial drink) and also used the bean as a currency. The Maya considered chocolate to be the food of the gods, held the cacao tree to be sacred, and even buried dignitaries with bowls of the substance (along with other items deemed useful in the afterlife). In fact, the identification of the (Olmec-originated) word ka-ka-w (\xe2\x80\x9ccacao\xe2\x80\x9d) inscribed on those containers was key to deciphering the Maya\xe2\x80\x99s phonetic manner of writing.\n\nSpain was the earliest European country to incorporate chocolate into its cuisine, but exactly how that happened is vague. It is known that Christopher Columbus took cocoa beans to Spain after his fourth voyage in 1502, though little was made of it at that time. It has been commonly thought (though there appears to be no evidence) that in 1519 Montezuma II, the Aztec ruler of Mexico, served a bitter cocoa-bean drink to the Spanish conquistador Hern\xc3\xa1n Cort\xc3\xa9s, who subsequently introduced the drink to Spain. A strong possibility is that chocolate first arrived in Spain in 1544 with representatives of the Kekch\xc3\xad Mayan people of Guatemala, who came bearing gifts (including chocolate) to visit the court of Prince Philip. However, it was not until 1585 that the first recorded shipment of cocoa beans arrived in Spain from Veracruz, Mexico. Sweetened and flavoured with cinnamon and vanilla, chocolate was served as a hot beverage and became quite popular in the Spanish court. It was many years before chocolate had its introduction to France, England, and beyond.\n\nengraving of an Aztec with cocoa beans and chocolate beverage \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican with his chocolate pot and goblet,\xe2\x80\x9d an engraving of an Aztec with cocoa beans and chocolate beverage, from a French history of chocolate, tea, and coffee, 1685. From Traitez Nouveaux and curieux du caf\xc3\xa9 du th\xc3\xa9 et du chocolate, by Philippe Sylvestre Dufour, 1685\n\nIn 1657 a Frenchman opened a shop in London at which solid chocolate for making the beverage could be purchased at 10 to 15 shillings per pound. At that price only the wealthy could afford to drink it, and there appeared in London, Amsterdam, and other European capitals fashionable chocolate houses, some of which later developed into famous private clubs. In London many chocolate houses were used as political party meeting places as well as high-stakes gambling spots, notably Cocoa-Tree Chocolate-House (later the Cocoa-Tree Club), which opened in 1698, and White\xe2\x80\x99s, which was opened by Francis White in 1693 as White\xe2\x80\x99s Chocolate-House. About 1700 the English improved chocolate by the addition of milk. The reduction of the cost of the beverage was hampered in Great Britain by the imposition of high import duties on the raw cocoa bean, and it was not until the mid-19th century, when the duty was lowered to a uniform rate of one penny per pound, that chocolate became popular.\n\nMeanwhile, the making of chocolate spread overseas and grew in sophistication. Chocolate manufacture started in the American colonies in 1765 at Dorchester, Massachusetts, using beans brought in by New England sea captains from their voyages to the West Indies. James Baker financed the first mill, which was operated by an Irish immigrant, John Hanan. Waterpower was used for grinding the beans. In the Netherlands in 1828, C.J. van Houten patented a process for pressing much of the fat, or cocoa butter, from ground and roasted cocoa beans and thus obtaining cocoa powder. In 1847 the English firm of Fry and Sons combined cocoa butter with chocolate liquor and sugar to produce sweet (eating) chocolate\xe2\x80\x94the base of most chocolate confectionary\xe2\x80\x94and in 1876 Daniel Peter of Switzerland added dried milk to make milk chocolate. The proliferation of flavoured, solid, and coated chocolate foods rapidly followed.'";"Other";"111.txt-Other"

"112.txt";"b'Share on Pinterest Screen Moment/Stocksy United Dark chocolate is loaded with nutrients that can positively affect your health. Made from the seed of the cacao tree, it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the best sources of antioxidants you can find. Studies show that dark chocolate can improve your health and lower the risk of heart disease. This article reviews 7 health benefits of dark chocolate or cocoa that are supported by science.\n\n1. Very nutritious If you buy quality dark chocolate with a high cocoa content, then it\xe2\x80\x99s quite nutritious. It contains a decent amount of soluble fiber and is loaded with minerals. A 100-gram bar of dark chocolate with 70\xe2\x80\x9385% cocoa contains (1): 11 grams of fiber\n\n67% of the DV for iron\n\n58% of the DV for magnesium\n\n89% of the DV for copper\n\n98% of the DV for manganese In addition, it has plenty of potassium, phosphorus, zinc, and selenium. Of course, 100 grams (3.5 ounces) is a fairly large amount and not something you should be consuming daily. These nutrients also come with 600 calories and moderate amounts of sugar. For this reason, dark chocolate is best consumed in moderation. The fatty acid profile of cocoa and dark chocolate is also good. The fats consist mostly of oleic acid (a heart-healthy fat also found in olive oil), stearic acid, and palmitic acid. The stearic acid has a neutral effect on body cholesterol. Palmitic acid can raise cholesterol levels, but it only makes up one-third of the total fat calories. Dark chocolate also contains stimulants like caffeine and theobromine, but it\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely to keep you awake at night, as the amount of caffeine is very small compared with coffee. Summary Quality dark chocolate is rich in fiber, iron, magnesium, copper, manganese, and a few other minerals.\n\n2. Powerful source of antioxidants ORAC stands for oxygen radical absorbance capacity. It\xe2\x80\x99s a measure of the antioxidant activity of foods. Basically, researchers set a bunch of free radicals (bad) against a sample of a food and see how well the antioxidants in the food can disarm the free radicals. The biological relevance of ORAC values is questioned, as it\xe2\x80\x99s measured in a test tube and may not have the same effect in the body. However, it\xe2\x80\x99s worth mentioning that raw, unprocessed cocoa beans are among the highest-scoring foods that have been tested. Dark chocolate is loaded with organic compounds that are biologically active and function as antioxidants. These include polyphenols, flavanols and catechins, among others. One study showed that cocoa and dark chocolate had more antioxidant activity, polyphenols, and flavanols than any other fruits tested, which included blueberries and acai berries (2). Summary Cocoa and dark chocolate have a wide variety of powerful antioxidants. In fact, they have way more than most other foods.\n\n3. May improve blood flow and lower blood pressure The flavanols in dark chocolate can stimulate the endothelium, the lining of arteries, to produce nitric oxide (NO) ( 3 ). One of the functions of NO is to send signals to the arteries to relax, which lowers the resistance to blood flow and therefore reduces blood pressure. Many controlled studies show that cocoa and dark chocolate can improve blood flow and lower blood pressure, though the effects are usually mild ( 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ). However, one study in people with high blood pressure showed no effect, so take this with a grain of salt ( 8 ). Given the great variation between studies on this subject, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that more research is needed ( 9 , 10). Summary The bioactive compounds in cocoa may improve blood flow in the arteries and cause a small but statistically significant decrease in blood pressure.\n\n4. Raises HDL and protects LDL from oxidation Consuming dark chocolate can improve several important risk factors for heart disease. In a controlled study, cocoa powder was found to significantly decrease oxidized LDL (bad) cholesterol in men. It also increased HDL and lowered total LDL for those with high cholesterol ( 11 ). Oxidized LDL means that the LDL cholesterol has reacted with free radicals. This makes the LDL particle itself reactive and capable of damaging other tissues, such as the lining of the arteries in your heart. It makes perfect sense that cocoa lowers oxidized LDL. It contains an abundance of powerful antioxidants that do make it into the bloodstream and protect lipoproteins against oxidative damage ( 12 , 13 , 14 ). The flavanols in dark chocolate can also reduce insulin resistance, which is another common risk factor for diseases like heart disease and diabetes ( 15 , 16 , 17 ). However, dark chocolate also contains sugar, which can have the opposite effect. Summary Dark chocolate improves several important risk factors for disease. It lowers the susceptibility of LDL to oxidative damage while increasing HDL and improving insulin sensitivity.\n\n5. May reduce heart disease risk The compounds in dark chocolate appear to be highly protective against the oxidation of LDL. In the long term, this should cause much less cholesterol to lodge in the arteries, resulting in a lower risk of heart disease. In fact, several long-term observational studies show a fairly drastic improvement. In a study of 470 older men, cocoa was found to reduce the risk of death from heart disease by 50% over 15 years ( 18 ). Another study revealed that eating chocolate two or more times per week lowered the risk of having calcified plaque in the arteries by 32%. Eating chocolate less frequently had no effect ( 19 ). Yet another study showed that eating dark chocolate more than five times per week lowered the risk of heart disease by 57% ( 20 ). A 2017 clinical trial found that subjects who consumed almonds with or without dark chocolate showed improved LDL cholesterol levels (21). Of course, these four studies are observational, so it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear exactly if it was the chocolate that reduced the risk. However, since the biological process is known (lower blood pressure and oxidized LDL), it\xe2\x80\x99s plausible that regularly eating dark chocolate may reduce the risk of heart disease. Summary Observational studies show a drastic reduction in heart disease risk among those who consume the most chocolate.\n\n6. May protect your skin from the sun The bioactive compounds in dark chocolate may also be great for your skin. The flavanols can protect against sun damage, improve blood flow to the skin, and increase skin density and hydration ( 22 ). The minimal erythemal dose (MED) is the minimum amount of UVB rays required to cause redness in the skin 24 hours after exposure. In one study of 30 people, the MED more than doubled after consuming dark chocolate high in flavanols for 12 weeks ( 23 ). If you\xe2\x80\x99re planning a beach vacation, consider enjoying some extra dark chocolate in the prior weeks and months. But check with your doctor or dermatologist before forgoing your normal skin care routine in favor of more dark chocolate. Summary Studies show that the flavanols from cocoa can improve blood flow to the skin and protect it from sun damage.\n\n7. Could improve brain function The good news isn\xe2\x80\x99t over yet. Dark chocolate may also improve the function of your brain. One study of healthy volunteers showed that eating high flavanol cocoa for 5 days improved blood flow to the brain ( 24 ). Cocoa may also significantly improve cognitive function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment. It may improve verbal fluency and several risk factors for disease, as well ( 25 ). Additionally, cocoa contains stimulant substances like caffeine and theobromine, which may be a key reason why it can improve brain function in the short term ( 26 ). Summary Cocoa or dark chocolate may improve brain function by increasing blood flow. It also contains stimulants like caffeine and theobromine.'";"Other";"112.txt-Other"

"114.txt";"b'If you think chocolate is heavenly, you\'re not alone. Chocolate literally is the ""food of the gods"" -- that\'s what its botanical name, Theobroma cacao, means. But you needn\'t be divine to indulge. Mere mortals adore chocolate in all its forms, from the humble chocolate chip cookie to gourmet goodies, wintry hot chocolate, and decadent desserts. And to make chocolate even more drool-worthy, researchers are discovering this ancient treat may have some modern health benefits.\n\nQ: When was chocolate first discovered?\n\nA: Chocolate dates back centuries. The Mayans traded valuable cacao beans, from which chocolate is made, as a commodity. In 1519, the Aztecs discovered that they could make a delicious drink by adding water and sweeteners to roasted, ground-up cacao beans. The chocolate bar came along later in the 18th century, by mixing chocolate with milk.\n\nQ: Are all chocolates good for you?\n\nA: Chocolate lovers, rejoice -- but be savvy about chocolate\'s health perks. Chocolate really can be good for you, but not all chocolate is created equally. If you\'re after health benefits, forget the chewy, caramel, marshmallow or cream-covered chocolates and look for solid dark chocolate.'";"Other";"114.txt-Other"

Kathy Hochul and Mayor Bill de Blasio weighed how to improve the response to extreme flooding in the future.\n\nA region assesses the damage from a sudden and deadly storm. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 2:02 - 0:00 transcript Ida Paralyzes the New York City Area The remnants of Hurricane Ida caused flash flooding and a number of deaths and disrupted transit across parts of New York and New Jersey. Look! The remnants of Hurricane Ida caused flash flooding and a number of deaths and disrupted transit across parts of New York and New Jersey. Credit Credit... Gregg Vigliotti for The New York Times The death toll from the remnants of Hurricane Ida grew on Friday with the announcement of two more deaths in New Jersey, bringing the total number of lives lost to 46 across four states hit that were hit by the storm Wednesday evening. Authorities fear the toll will increase further: Gov. Phillip D. Murphy of New Jersey said at least six people were still missing in the floods. \xe2\x80\x9cThis was a deadly and dangerous storm, and we continue to face its aftereffects,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at a morning news conference. The dead include 25 people in New Jersey, 16 in New York, four in Pennsylvania and one in Connecticut. In New York City, where 13 people died, most of whom were trapped in flooded basement apartments, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Friday that going forward, when flash floods were forecast, the city would go door-to-door in neighborhoods with high concentrations of such apartments and evacuate residents. New Jersey officials released a county-by-county breakdown of deaths. They were concentrated in a belt across the upper middle region of the state, with most occurring in Hunterdon County (6 deaths), Union County (5), Essex County (4) and Somerset County (4).

The aid will be distributed in grants of $1,000 to $5,000. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99ve been crushed and you can prove it, you\xe2\x80\x99re eligible,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Murphy said. Mr. Murphy and Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York both said that they were expecting large infusions of recovery aid from the federal government once a federal disaster has been declared, something that President Biden is expected to do after his declaration Thursday night of federal emergency status for New York and New Jersey. Ms. Hochul said the state would easily surpass the $30 million threshold required for the federal government to eventually issue a so-called major disaster declaration, which would loosen a wider range of federal assistance for individuals and infrastructure projects. Locations of Deaths Caused by the Storm More than 40 people were killed by the heavy rains and flooding in the New York region on Wednesday and Thursday. This map shows where deaths are known to have occurred. There are no figures yet on the extent of property damage caused by the storm, which dumped half a foot of water in just a few hours across parts of the region, but many hundreds of homes, at least, were damaged. The Red Cross said it housed nearly 400 people in temporary shelters in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and New York Thursday night. On Friday, New York City\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Education said that 234 of its roughly 1,600 public school buildings were affected by the storm, mostly by basement flooding, but that all the buildings will reopen when school starts Sept. 13. As of Friday afternoon, more than 30,000 homes in the region were still without power, including 20,000 in Pennsylvania and more than 7,000 each in New Jersey and New York. The status of mass transit in the region remains spotty. Most New York City subway lines are running regular service. But on commuter rails, all service of Metro-North Railroad is either suspended or limited, and three New Jersey Transit lines \xe2\x80\x94 the Gladstone, Pascack Valley and Raritan Valley \xe2\x80\x94 remain shut down.

Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:44 - 0:00 transcript New York\xe2\x80\x99s Mayor Outlines Rain-Preparedness Plan Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York announced new measures for rain emergencies, driven by climate change, including issuing weather-related travel bans and quickly evacuating people in basement apartments and other areas at high risk for flooding. Today, I\xe2\x80\x99m announcing the N.Y.C. Climate Driven Rain Response. We have to handle this differently because we\xe2\x80\x99ve now been shown an entirely different situation. It is climate driven and that\xe2\x80\x99s crucial to put upfront. Because it\xe2\x80\x99s not like the rain we used to know. It\xe2\x80\x99s just not. It\xe2\x80\x99s a different reality of speed and intensity that we now have to understand will be normal. Wednesday evening was the first time the National Weather Service in history, determined that there needed to be a flash flood emergency in New York City. Not the normal warnings we get, but on the Wednesday night, they said this is an entirely different thing. We need to answer that with the use of travel bans. Now, a travel ban is not something to do lightly. We\xe2\x80\x99ve only done it a few times previously, particularly during massive snowstorms, blizzards. But unfortunately, what we learned on Wednesday night is a travel ban is the kind of tool we may need to use much more frequently, which would mean, for example, that that same morning or that day before, telling people there is a chance that a travel ban will be activated. And once it\xe2\x80\x99s activated, people will have to leave the streets, get out of subways, et cetera, immediately. For folks in basement apartments and in some other areas of the city as well, if we are seeing this kind of rain, we have to have an evacuation mechanism that can reach them. And again, this is a very forceful measure. It\xe2\x80\x99s not just saying to people, you have to get out of your apartment. It\xe2\x80\x99s going door to door with our first responders, and other city agencies to get people out. Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York announced new measures for rain emergencies, driven by climate change, including issuing weather-related travel bans and quickly evacuating people in basement apartments and other areas at high risk for flooding. Credit Credit... Spencer Platt/Getty Images In the wake of the deaths of 13 people in New York City from this week\xe2\x80\x99s flooding, most of them in basement apartments, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Friday that the city would increase the use of evacuation orders and travel bans, issue stronger flood warnings to those living in basement apartments and send emergency responders door-to-door to help evacuate residents. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have to change everything,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. de Blasio said of the effort he called \xe2\x80\x9cClimate-Driven Rain Response,\xe2\x80\x9d which was immediately criticized by advocates and officials. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not like the rain we used to know,\xe2\x80\x9d the mayor added. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a different reality, a speed and intensity that we now have to understand will be normal.\xe2\x80\x9d The city recorded its heaviest one-hour rainfall ever on Wednesday, 3.15 inches, breaking a record set only days earlier by Tropical Storm Henri. Mr. de Blasio said that the city will now issue travel bans more quickly. And instead of using evacuation to remove people from coastal areas, the city will now move to evacuate people in basement apartments and other areas that face flooding from heavy rain. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a very forceful measure. It\xe2\x80\x99s not just saying to people you have to get out of your apartment, it\xe2\x80\x99s going door-to-door with our first responders and other city agencies to get people out,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. de Blasio said. The city will target special phone alerts to neighborhoods, particularly in Queens, with heavy concentrations of basement apartments. The apartments are collectively home to tens of thousands of New Yorkers, largely immigrants, and are mostly illegally converted and subdivided units. In spite of warnings from the National Weather Service that New York City would see heavy rain and flash floods, Mr. de Blasio said the intensity of Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s rainfall was unprecedented and caught city officials off guard. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got to literally change the whole way of thinking because as good as some of the projections are, they can\xe2\x80\x99t always keep up with weather that changes this rapidly and this radically,\xe2\x80\x9d he said on MSNBC. But the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s plan was immediately panned by housing advocates and officials who said it left tenants who were caught at the intersection of the affordable housing crisis and the climate crisis just as vulnerable as before the floods. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a bizarre plan because you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about evacuating tenants who you don't know where they live,\xe2\x80\x9d said Annetta Seecharran, the executive director of the Chhaya Community Development Corporation, which works on housing issues for low-income South Asian and Indo-Caribbean New Yorkers. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s rather neglectful to not address the root cause of the problem, which is how do we ensure people living in these apartments are safe? City Councilman Brad Lander, the Democratic nominee for city comptroller, said the city should provide basic safety improvements for basement apartments such as smoke detectors and then relaunch a defunded pilot program to convert illegal basement apartments. \xe2\x80\x9cIt sounds like the mayor is saying let\xe2\x80\x99s leave people in unregulated, illegal, unsafe basement units at large scale but hope they check their Notify N.Y.C. Twitter alerts, which does not sound like a good way to keep people safe\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Eric Adams, the Democratic nominee for mayor, favors legalizing basement apartments and has criticized the decision to defund the pilot. Letitia James, the state attorney general, said the mayor should provide emergency housing vouchers for all residents of unregulated basement apartments. \xe2\x80\x9cExtreme rainfall and other severe weather events are now the rule, not the exception, in New York,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in a statement. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the face of that risk, it is our duty to move these New Yorkers out of harm\xe2\x80\x99s way by offering them safer, regulated housing.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGov.

Kathy Hochul of New York spoke about the state\xe2\x80\x99s death toll on Friday: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s hard to even read those numbers, because those numbers are people.\xe2\x80\x9d Credit... Stephanie Keith for The New York Times New York State officials were in the preliminary phases of assessing Ida\xe2\x80\x99s damage on Friday, a day after President Biden approved an emergency declaration that will open up additional federal resources, including $5 million for affected counties. Even so, state leaders said they would need additional federal assistance to fully recover from Ida\xe2\x80\x99s torrential rains, which inundated the region and killed at least 16 people in New York, where more than 7,000 people were still without electricity. Gov. Kathy Hochul said on Friday the state would easily surpass the $30 million threshold required to request a so-called major disaster declaration, which would loosen a wider range of federal aid for individuals and infrastructure projects. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t ever want again to see Niagara Falls rushing down the stairs of one of the New York City subways,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Hochul said during a morning briefing in Westchester County. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t prevent it right now, but I know we have to take action to mitigate that.\xe2\x80\x9d Power had been restored to more than 80,000 customers, but more than 6,400 households in Westchester County alone still lacked electricity. About a dozen roads, from the Bronx to Rockland County, were fully or partially closed. And the Metro-North Railroad system had sustained severe damage and \xe2\x80\x9cwas not in good shape right now,\xe2\x80\x9d stressing that repairing it was \xe2\x80\x9cnot going to happen very quickly.\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Hochul said officials from the Department of Financial Services would fan out to help homeowners and businesses file insurance claims to receive reimbursements for damages, urging property owners to keep \xe2\x80\x9cgood records.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHomeowners, keep track of everything you have to spend to get your houses cleaned up and restored as best you can and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll take it from there,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. Questions have already emerged over whether city and state officials were adequately prepared for the storm. While the state deployed emergency resources before the storm, for example, Ms. Hochul did not declare a state of emergency until early Thursday, when the brunt of Ida\xe2\x80\x99s rains had already inundated roads and train tracks. \xe2\x80\x9cWe did not know that we\xe2\x80\x99d be in the same vulnerable situation with loss of life and property destruction,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, referring to the damage from Ida just days earlier in Louisiana and Mississippi. Ms. Hochul stressed that the staggering amount of rainfall that drenched the state in such a short window of time caught officials and meteorologists off guard on Wednesday night. \xe2\x80\x9cI think the meteorologists are surprised,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, adding that \xe2\x80\x9cMother Nature does what she wants.\xe2\x80\x9d She said that people were properly warned about the flash floods via text, but that perhaps the warnings should have been translated into more languages or had failed to reach the \xe2\x80\x9cvulnerable population\xe2\x80\x9d living in basement apartments where many died. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have to get a better system for evacuations and deploy people on the ground in these events and not hope that they got a message,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Hochul said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not even sure they own a cellphone.\xe2\x80\x9d Even so, she openly questioned whether the state could have done more to alert New Yorkers or to evacuate the subway system before stations began to flood. She promised to convene a task force to tackle such questions and put together an after-action report to determine if there were any \xe2\x80\x9cmissed opportunities.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI want to know exactly what we did right,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Hochul said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf there\xe2\x80\x99s any areas that were shortcomings, I want to know what they are and how we address them.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMost of the apartments where New Yorkers drowned were illegal residences. The city says that most of the apartments where people drowned in Queens were illegal conversions, including the one in this house in Jamaica. Credit... Gregg Vigliotti for The New York Times New York City\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Buildings said Friday that five of the six houses in which New Yorkers were killed by Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s flood were illegally converted cellar or basement apartments. Of the 13 people found dead in the city from the storm, at least 11 were in basement units, which have long made up a significant part of New York City\xe2\x80\x99s vast housing stock, a network of rentals that often lack basic safety features like more than one way to get in or out. The department said that four of the five basement apartments where people were killed in Queens were illegal conversions, as was one on Ridgewood Avenue in Brooklyn, where another person died. Another basement apartment, on Grand Central Parkway in Queens, was a legal dwelling, the department said. It is illegal to alter an existing building to create additional apartment units without obtaining official approval, and such apartments are often considered unsafe by authorities, given their shoddy construction, poorly installed gas and electrical systems and light and ventilation issues. Still, the apartments remain in demand, in part because they are often far cheaper than most rentals. The buildings department has received reports of over 1,100 properties across the city that were damaged by the storm, and its inspectors are conducting safety checks at each location. \xe2\x80\x9cOur team is tirelessly conducting inspections at over a thousand properties across the five boroughs in the aftermath of Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s storm,\xe2\x80\x9d said the department\xe2\x80\x99s commissioner, Melanie E. La Rocca. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll continue doing everything we can to keep New Yorkers safe in their residences.\xe2\x80\x9d Climate change has made low-lying homes increasingly treacherous, because of the likelihood of deadly flooding as a wall of water blocks what is often the only means of escape. Last year, the department received 11,781 complaints related to units believed to be illegal conversions, down from 16,776 in 2019. So far this year it has received 8,072 such complaints. In about half of the cases since 2011, inspectors closed the complaints because they could not gain access to the dwelling, a New York Times analysis of buildings department data shows.

Essence Crockett was wrapping up a visit to her mother, who has advanced Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s disease, when she heard her mother\xe2\x80\x99s home health aide scream from the other side of the garden apartment in Forest Hills, Queens. \xe2\x80\x9cShe started yelling from the next room, \xe2\x80\x98Come, come! There\xe2\x80\x99s water coming in!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Crockett said. \xe2\x80\x9cI ran out into the living room and water was just forcing its way through her front apartment door and also her second garden door.\xe2\x80\x9d The two women \xe2\x80\x94 Ms. Crockett and the aide, Obianuju Okoro \xe2\x80\x94 began to frantically grab chairs and other items they thought might block the gushing water. But it would not stop pouring in. Image Claire Adams, 88, who cannot walk, was trapped in rising water that reached her neck before help came in through a window. Credit... Essence Crockett Ms. Crockett\xe2\x80\x99s mother, Claire Adams, 88, can no longer walk, so the women ran to her room and began the laborious process of transferring her from her hospital bed to her wheelchair using a hydraulic lift. By the time they wheeled Ms. Adams into the living room, the force of the water had sealed both doors firmly shut. Water rose to their ankles, and then their knees. They were trapped. Panic set in. Ms. Adams, whom her daughter described as \xe2\x80\x9cagitated\xe2\x80\x9d even on a good day, began to scream, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m cold! I\xe2\x80\x99m wet!\xe2\x80\x9d as the water rose around her in her wheelchair. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was no way to explain what was happening to her,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Crockett, 60, said. As the water rose, she and Ms. Okoro began to lose hope. Looking at the windows, they realized they could push the air-conditioners out and perhaps scramble to safety. But they could not take Ms. Adams with them. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought this is the end,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Crockett said through tears on Friday. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense for us to all perish. I thought my mother\xe2\x80\x99s aide should not sacrifice her life. And then I turned and said goodbye to my mother.\xe2\x80\x9d As they climbed, Ms. Crockett said, Ms. Okoro wept and kept saying, \xe2\x80\x9cYour mother, your mother!\xe2\x80\x9d When they got onto the street in front of the building, they were greeted by the panicked screams of their neighbors. Eight other garden apartments in the building were also being flooded. The lobby had filled with several feet of murky water, and the pressure of the rushing water had made its doors difficult to open. They tried to call 911, Ms. Okoro said, but the call would not connect. So she ran into the building to get help, wading through several feet of cold, leaf-strewn water in the lobby and climbing the stairs to the second floor to bang on the doors of Ms. Adams\xe2\x80\x99s neighbors. Most of them were too afraid to go into the water. But soon she found a longtime neighbor of Ms. Adams, Michael Lettieri, who agreed to swim back through the lobby with her and followed her outside. \xe2\x80\x9cThe whole lobby was flooded,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Lettieri said. \xe2\x80\x9cI never thought I\xe2\x80\x99d see a thing like that in my life \xe2\x80\x94 it was like a white water river coming in through the door.\xe2\x80\x9d When he heard that Ms. Adams was trapped in her apartment, Mr. Lettieri climbed through the same window that Ms. Crockett and Ms. Okoro had fled through. Ms. Okoro and another man soon followed him. They found Ms. Adams in her wheelchair with water up to her neck, but were able to lift her back onto her bed, they said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was just her head that was out of the water,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Okoro said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was screaming, \xe2\x80\x98I am cold!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Image Credit... Essence Crockett The rising floodwaters had lifted the mattress off the hospital bed\xe2\x80\x99s metal frame, and Ms. Adams was able to float on it like a raft. Mr. Lettieri stood there with her as water rose to his chest, making sure she stayed safely onboard, Ms. Crockett said. With Ms. Adams bobbing on the water in her flooded apartment, Ms. Okoro said she climbed back out the window and, with Ms. Crockett, flagged down a passing police car. Two officers came with them and broke down the apartment\xe2\x80\x99s garden door so Ms. Adams could be taken to Forest Hills Hospital, where she was resting on Friday. Her home of 43 years has been \xe2\x80\x9cdestroyed,\xe2\x80\x9d her daughter said. But they hope to rebuild. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are here; mother is still here,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Crockett said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis was a miracle. And I will forever be grateful for our neighbors and my mother\xe2\x80\x99s aide, who was an absolute champion.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAfter delivery workers braved the storm, advocates call for better conditions. On Wednesday night, many couriers barely made enough money to justify the hours spent toiling in the floods, one advocate said. Credit... David Dee Delgado/Getty Images When Mayor Bill de Blasio urged New Yorkers to stay home and take shelter from the downpour and flooding Wednesday night, one group of people continued to go out: food delivery workers, many of whom were motivated by incentives from delivery apps. After a video of a courier walking his bike through murky waist-deep water to deliver a customer\xe2\x80\x99s food sparked outrage, advocates for workers\xe2\x80\x99 rights called on the city and delivery apps to increase minimum wages and strengthen safety protections. \xe2\x80\x9cThe mayor is saying, \xe2\x80\x98Go home.\xe2\x80\x99 But the apps are giving economic incentives to the workers. \xe2\x80\x98No, stay out, stay out,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Hildalyn Col\xc3\xb3n, director of policy for Los Deliveristas Unidos, a food delivery workers\xe2\x80\x99 rights group in the city. Food delivery companies offer extra money when demand is high or during inclement weather, leading some couriers to risk their safety for the promise of potentially higher wages. Summer is also slow season in the delivery business, so many workers jump at the chance to earn more even in dangerous conditions. But on Wednesday night, many couriers barely made enough money to justify the hours spent toiling in the floods, said Ligia Guallpa, executive director of Workers Justice Project. Some Grubhub workers told her they made as little as $2 extra per delivery, she said. For the delivery service Relay, which enables restaurants to have food delivered through any delivery app, workers must complete at least 90 percent of their scheduled deliveries in order to be paid at all, Ms. Col\xc3\xb3n said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s why you see these workers in the middle of the moving water holding a bag, trying to hold it together,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Col\xc3\xb3n said. A Relay representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Workers fear retaliation from the companies if they chose to turn down deliveries or sign off the app to go home, Ms. Guallpa said. Without the legal protections of full-time employment, there is little to keep them from getting lower ratings or getting deactivated by the apps if they decline deliveries, she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWorkers were surprised to see companies were not providing incentives to go home, and there was no communication that no retaliation would happen if they opt not to take those deliveries,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Guallpa said. A DoorDash spokeswoman, Campbell Millum, said in a statement that while some workers may have been offered incentive bonuses Wednesday night, the company now regrets having pressured them to keep working. \xe2\x80\x9cAlthough we were able to pause delivery in some parts of the city as the flash flooding occurred, we should have acted more quickly and comprehensively to suspend ordering, turn off incentives to get Dashers on the roads, and communicate with all of our stakeholders,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, adding that the company was \xe2\x80\x9cputting in place controls to do better going forward.\xe2\x80\x9d A Grubhub spokesman said driver pay per order increased by a \xe2\x80\x9cdouble digit percentage\xe2\x80\x9d Wednesday night, and that drivers would not be penalized for turning orders down. Deliveries were also paused in parts of New York Wednesday night, he said, though he would not give details. Adding to the challenges delivery workers faced were equipment failures. One worker who lives in the Bronx had to spend all the money he earned that night fixing water damage to his electric scooter, Ms. Guallpa said. Los Deliveristas and the Workers Justice Project hope to push a legislative package of worker protections through the City Council later this year. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople asked, \xe2\x80\x98Why did they risk their life?\xe2\x80\x99 This is the way they make their living,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Col\xc3\xb3n said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen they offer you $2, for them, it\xe2\x80\x99s like a lifeline.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s what to do if your home flooded during Ida. People cleaned up from the flooding in Flushing, Queens, on Thursday. Credit... Benjamin Norman for The New York Times The remnants of Hurricane Ida and resulting flood on Wednesday dealt a blow to the greater New York region \xe2\x80\x94 claiming at least 46 lives, damaging property and rendering homes uninhabitable. Here are answers to five frequently asked questions on home cleanup and more. How can I determine whether my home is safe to enter after a flood? According to the C.D.C.\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cRe-entering your Flooded Home\xe2\x80\x9d guide, you should have an electrician assess your home before re-entering. If you are set on re-entering, try to do it during the day to avoid the need for electricity, and do so carefully, as homes may have suffered structural damage. Ganesh Lallbachan, the owner of G&R Electrical Contractors in Queens, said that people should be particularly cautious if water reached the level of an electrical outlet. He advised the use of long rubber boots. If you smell natural or propane gas or hear a hissing noise, leave immediately and call the fire department. Before you begin the cleaning process, you should take photos to keep for your records, for insurance and in the event that you need to present your landlord with proof of damage. What possessions can I keep and what must I dispose of? \xe2\x80\x9cWhen in doubt, throw it out!\xe2\x80\x9d said Katie Wilkes, a spokeswoman for the American Red Cross. She added that items that absorb water and cannot be cleaned or disinfected included mattresses, carpeting, cosmetics, stuffed animals and baby toys. Get rid of all food that has come in contact with flood water, including canned goods. Don\xe2\x80\x99t use water that could have been contaminated to cook, wash dishes or brush your teeth. Mold is a major concern after a flood or hurricane, particularly for people with respiratory problems. The C.D.C.\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cGuide to Mold Cleanup After Disasters\xe2\x80\x9d and the city\xe2\x80\x99s website offer tips on dealing with mold. The C.D.C. also offers a guide on tools, cleaning agents and gear necessary for safely tackling cleanup after a flood or other disaster. My home is uninhabitable \xe2\x80\x94 where can I stay? \xe2\x80\x9cThe onus falls on the landlord,\xe2\x80\x9d said Manuel Belliard, an aide in City Councilman Mark Levine\xe2\x80\x99s office. If landlords with the ability to do so refuse to put their tenants up in a hotel or apartment, renters can seek out legal assistance from the New York Legal Assistance Group, Legal Aid or the Bar Association. Is my landlord responsible for reimbursing me for the cost of my damaged possessions? No. Your landlord is responsible for structural repairs, addressing issues with your roof, floors and walls. The cost of personal items like electronics and clothing fall to you. Going forward, consider renter\xe2\x80\x99s insurance and make sure it covers flood and water damage. I\xe2\x80\x99m rattled and traumatized by my experience \xe2\x80\x94 does New York City offer mental health services? Anyone can contact the city\xe2\x80\x99s mental health services, by texting \xe2\x80\x9cWELL\xe2\x80\x9d to 65173 or calling 1-888-WELL-NYC. For disaster-specific trauma, call or text the Disaster Distress hotline at 1-800-985-5990.\n\nNew York State urges insurance companies to expedite storm-related claims. An underpass along Queens Boulevard on Thursday. Credit... Dakota Santiago for The New York Times New York State officials, bracing for a rush of insurance claims after record-breaking rain submerged large parts of New York City, are urging insurance companies to expedite storm-related claims. The message on Thursday from the New York State Department of Financial Services, which regulates insurance companies, came as the damage from flooding from the remnants of Hurricane Ida was still coming into focus. \xe2\x80\x9cIn this emergency situation, DFS expects all insurers to do their part,\xe2\x80\x9d the department said in a statement. It is \xe2\x80\x9cimperative\xe2\x80\x9d that insurance companies come to a \xe2\x80\x9cspeedy resolution of claims.\xe2\x80\x9d The Department of Financial Services also said it would increase the number of people who could process claims by accelerating its process of approving independent insurance adjusters from outside the state to work in New York. When Hurricane Sandy pounded the New York area in October 2012, approximately 300 homes were destroyed, and more than 20,000 homes were damaged, according to city officials. North of the city, in Westchester County, the Red Cross opened a shelter in Mamaroneck High School for people whose homes were destroyed or heavily damaged in the storm. It served 125 people on Thursday night and the shelter remains open, the organization said. The damage from the storm underscored how vulnerable major parts of New York City\xe2\x80\x99s infrastructure are to extreme weather. For more information, New York City residents can type their address into this website and see whether their home is in an area at risk of flooding. The site, FloodHelpNY.org, was created by the nonprofit Center for New York City Neighborhoods, which receives funding from the city and state of New York.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNew Yorkers tried to save neighbors from Ida\xe2\x80\x99s floods.

Her neighbor, Roberto Bravo, died there on Wednesday night as surging waters poured in. Credit... Anna Watts for The New York Times The torrents from Ida\xe2\x80\x99s waters cascaded through New York City basement doors and windows, turning everyday spaces into death traps. In Woodside, Queens, Deborah Torres said she heard the desperate pleas from the basement of three members of a family, including a toddler. As the water rushed into the building around 10 p.m. on Wednesday, Ms. Torres said she heard the family frantically call out to another neighbor, Choi Sledge. Ms. Sledge pleaded with the family to flee. Within moments, however, the cascade of water was too powerful, and it also kept anyone from trying to get downstairs to help. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was impossible,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ms. Torres, who lives on the first floor. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was like a pool.\xe2\x80\x9d The family did not survive. Darlene Lee, 48, was in a basement apartment that belonged to the super of a condominium in Central Parkway, Queens. Flooding burst through a glass sliding door in the apartment, and quickly filled it with about six feet of murky water. The water pinned Ms. Lee between the apartment\xe2\x80\x99s steel front door and the door frame, leaving her wedged and unable to escape. Patricia Fuentes, the property manager, had just gotten off work when she heard Ms. Lee screaming for help and found her stuck. Ms. Fuentes ran to the lobby to call for aid, and Jayson Jordan, the assistant super, and Andy Tapia, a handyman, jumped through the broken glass door to get to Ms. Lee. But they could not save her. Ms. Lee was pinned and Mr. Tapia tried to help her keep her above the chin-deep water. Eventually, the men were able to pry her from the door, but it was too late, Mr. Jordan said. Ms. Lee was killed by the storm. In Cypress Hills, Brooklyn, Ricardo Garcia was awakened by a surge of water that he said exploded through the door of his shared basement apartment at about 10:15 p.m. In moments, it was up to his knees, then his waist, then his chest. Mr. Garcia, 50, banged on the door next to his, waking another roommate, Oliver De La Cruz, who was shaking on Thursday morning as he looked at the water stains that reached to the ceiling of his ruined room.

Anna Watts for The New York Times \xe2\x80\x9cI almost died inside here, I almost died, man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. De La Cruz, 22. Mr. De La Cruz broke down his bedroom door to escape in his boxer shorts. Mr. Garcia said that he and Mr. De La Cruz climbed to the first floor, struggling against the water pouring down the stairs. Mr. De La Cruz found his upstairs neighbor, Roxanna Florentino, who has lived in the building for 18 years. She said she heard another man, 66-year-old Roberto Bravo, crying out for help from a back bedroom in the basement apartment. Image Roberto Bravo Credit... via Pablo Bravo Ms. Florentino said Mr. Bravo was pleading for help in Spanish, and neighbors were trying to reach him. But water was pouring through both the front door and a window. She realized Mr. Bravo\xe2\x80\x99s screaming had stopped. On Thursday, it was clear that the water had risen so forcefully where Mr. Bravo had been that it tore off the door and broke though the ceiling, leaving dank decay. The Ecuadorean flag hanging on his wall was soaked and muddied, the floor below strewn with debris, along with a water-stained photo of Mr. Bravo in a tuxedo at a formal event.

They brought out Mr. Bravo\xe2\x80\x99s body. She tried to sleep but each time she drifted off, she heard Mr. Bravo\xe2\x80\x99s voice, calling a last time. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so hard when someone asks for help and you can\xe2\x80\x99t help them,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.

Earl Wilson/The New York Times Two days after the remnants of Hurricane Ida brought torrential flooding and deadly downpours to New York, much of the region\xe2\x80\x99s transit system was back up and running Friday evening. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority conducted round-the-clock repairs to get the nation\xe2\x80\x99s largest subway system fully running again after the storm damaged tracks and turned platforms and stairwells into water slides. A majority of subway lines were back in service Friday with few delays and partial suspensions. (Check the latest service updates here.) \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve managed to restore a ton of service today but our tracks in Queens suffered the most damage,\xe2\x80\x9d the M.T.A. said on Twitter on Thursday night, urging those traveling in Queens to consider taking the Long Island Railroad instead. The Long Island Railroad will provide free rides between several Queens stations for those who show conductors their MetroCards or OMNY app. Our teams worked tirelessly throughout the night to restore subway service on almost all lines (the 6 remains partially suspended).\n\n\n\nWhile trains can run everywhere, service may not be frequent. Some lines have *extremely* limited service. In Queens, consider LIRR if possible. \xe2\x80\x94 NYCT Subway. Wear a Mask. (@NYCTSubway) September 3, 2021 Amtrak said it would resume service along the Northeast Corridor, between Washington and Boston, on Friday, but it said trains between Albany and New York City would remain canceled. New Jersey Transit said all train lines except Pascack Valley and Raritan Valley would resume operations as usual. The Newark Light Rail also reopened Friday evening after a small sinkhole that opened up on the tracks from the storm was repaired. The Long Island Rail Road resumed full service by Friday and will return to its usual weekend schedule Saturday. On the Metro-North Railroad, train service resumed Friday for the New Haven Line and the Harlem Line after workers cleared more than 10 inches of water and debris from several stations. Both lines will run enhanced weekend service as the Hudson Line, which suffered the most damage, remained suspended. \xe2\x80\x9cOur crews have made extraordinary progress over the last 24 hours in extremely difficult conditions,\xe2\x80\x9d Catherine Rinaldi, president of Metro-North, said in a statement Thursday night. \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot thank our crew members enough for the heroic work they have been doing and will continue to do.\xe2\x80\x9d On Twitter, the M.T.A. praised \xe2\x80\x9chero bus operators\xe2\x80\x9d for keeping the city moving during Wednesday night\xe2\x80\x99s floods and the days that followed. \xe2\x80\x9cAs we head into Labor Day weekend, we\xe2\x80\x99re thankful for the tens of thousands of essential workers across the tri-state who have been working nonstop to put the region back together,\xe2\x80\x9d the M.T.A. said on Twitter Friday. Flights on Friday morning out of La Guardia Airport, Kennedy International Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport largely appeared to be on time with minimal delays. In response to questions during a news conference Friday on how the M.T.A. could strengthen its system against future storms, Mayor Bill de Blasio called for the state to move quickly to implement congestion pricing. Mr. de Blasio also pointed to federal stimulus money included in President Biden\xe2\x80\x99s proposed infrastructure bill, part of which the city would use to strengthen its public transit. \xe2\x80\x9cWe need resources on a vast scale to fix the M.T.A.,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. de Blasio said. \xe2\x80\x9cCongestion pricing will bring us the regular revenue to constantly make improvements.\xe2\x80\x9d Derrick Bryson Taylor and\n\nWhat went wrong? Despite Ida warnings, New York officials couldn\xe2\x80\x99t prevent death and destruction. The authorities responding to a basement apartment in Queens on Thursday, where flooding killed three people. Credit... Gregg Vigliotti for The New York Times The warnings and maps seemed clear. On Tuesday evening, the National Weather Service issued a prediction that a wide swath of the Ohio Valley and the Eastern Seaboard would soon see heavy rainfall from what had once been Hurricane Ida. And one of the reddest portions of those maps \xe2\x80\x94 indicating severe rainfall and a high probability of flooding \xe2\x80\x94 hovered directly over New York City. Those predictions proved true. But the record intensity of the rain, with more than three inches falling in one hour, caught officials by surprise. And on Thursday, as the death toll in the Northeast increased, questions quickly arose as to whether city and state officials were caught flat-footed by the storm\xe2\x80\x99s ferocity. The destruction in the New York region seemed especially striking considering that Ida had already blown through the Gulf Coast, hitting New Orleans on Sunday with far stronger winds but with fewer deaths. It also came in the wake of a series of ever-more-powerful tropical storms \xe2\x80\x94 including 2012\xe2\x80\x99s Hurricane Sandy \xe2\x80\x94 which have been repeatedly cited as warning signs that the city\xe2\x80\x99s aging infrastructure and subways are vulnerable to the violent weather caused by climate change. The subways, in particular, have come to act as a default sewer whenever heavy rains overwhelm the city\xe2\x80\x99s actual sewer system. The storm\xe2\x80\x99s devastation underscored the city\xe2\x80\x99s increasing fragility in the age of global warming, but also illustrated how the unpredictability of weather events can topple even the best laid of plans.

He narrated shows at Carnegie Hall, he spent a decade hosting the Macy\'s Thanksgiving Day Parade and he appeared in countless commercials \xe2\x80\x94 all after he found success as the lovable, oddball weather guy on NBC\'s Today show. Scott died Saturday at 87.\n\nAl Roker, who announced the death of his former NBC colleague on Instagram, said Scott was surrounded by family when he ""passed peacefully.""\n\n""We lost a beloved member of our @todayshow family this morning,"" Roker wrote. ""He was truly my second dad and am where I am today because of his generous spirit. Willard was a man of his times, the ultimate broadcaster. There will never be anyone quite like him.""\n\nScott spent practically his whole life in the business. At 16, he got his foot in the door as a page boy at NBC\'s Washington, D.C., bureau. Three years later, he started co-hosting the Joy Boys radio show, a nightly hodgepodge of comedy bits.\n\nHe was the original Ronald McDonald\n\nHis goofy act became a staple of local radio and TV. Kids who grew up around Washington in the early \'60s knew Scott by another name: Bozo the Clown. Then he landed a role that would become part of the fabric of American popular culture \xe2\x80\x94 Scott was the original Ronald McDonald.\n\nVintageTVCommercials YouTube\n\nIn 1967, Scott got his first gig as a local TV weatherman. Thirteen years later, in 1980, then-Today show host Tom Brokaw introduced him to viewers from coast to coast. It wasn\'t long before his wacky persona won over a national audience.\n\n""Weather can be pretty bland on a day to day basis, and so what you do is to add a little shtick to it,"" Scott told NPR in 1987. That shtick included playing around with his infamously bad toupee, impersonated pop star Boy George and then, one morning, the ultimate Willard Scott stunt: He delivered the weather dressed up as Brazilian singer Carmen Miranda. Not everyone at NBC was amused.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption David Pickoff/AP David Pickoff/AP\n\nWishing centenarians a \'happy birthday\' became his trademark\n\n""There are people up there, who made a lot of money, betting on me to fall on my face and that this whole cornball act would never make it,"" he told NPR.\n\nBut it worked. And even though Scott contrived a lot of his ""shtick,"" his trademark act was actually developed by the folks watching at home. One day in 1983, a viewer wrote in asking Scott to wish his uncle a happy 100th birthday on air. Scott obliged, and more requests flooded in. The birthday wishes became so popular that after Scott left his post delivering Today\'s weather in 1996, he would still appear twice a week to greet his so-called birthday buddies. He even wrote books about them with his usual sense of humor.\n\nHe shared a story about one of his birthday buddies with NPR: ""A stock broker had recently tried to sell this man municipal bonds that matured in 20 years. And [he] said, \'Hell,\' he said, \'at my age I don\'t even buy green bananas.\' ""\n\nWillard Scott may be best known for bringing TV viewers the weather, but what he always delivered was a laugh.'";"Other";"1163.txt-Other"

"1197.txt";"b'From the 12th to the 15th of July, heavy rainfall associated with cut-off low-pressure system \xe2\x80\x9cBernd\xe2\x80\x9d led to severe flooding particularly in the German states North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate, as well as in Luxembourg, and along the river Meuse and some of its tributaries in Belgium and the Netherlands.\n\nAt the time of the heavy rainfall event, soils were in part already saturated. Some valley sections are very narrow with steep slopes leading to funnel-like effects in the event of extreme floods. These factors were modified locally also by differences in land cover, infrastructure and water management alleviating or increasing the devastation of the extreme flooding. At the Ahr river the flood is estimated to be a 500 year event or rarer according to preliminary data.\n\nThe flooding resulted in at least 184 fatalities in Germany and 38 in Belgium and considerable damage to infrastructure, including houses, motorways and railway lines and bridges and key income sources. Road closures left some places inaccessible for days, cutting off some villages from evacuation routes and emergency response. The worst affected areas were around the rivers Ahr, Erft and Meuse.\n\nScientists from Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, France, Luxembourg, the US and the UK, collaborated to assess to what extent human-induced climate change altered the likelihood and intensity of the heavy rainfall causing the severe flooding.\n\nUsing published peer-reviewed methods, we analysed how human-induced climate change affected maximum 1-day and 2-day rainfall events in the summer season (April-September) in two small regions where the recent flooding has been most severe in the Ahr-Erft region (Germany) and on the Meuse (Belgium) and anywhere over a larger region including Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.\n\nMain findings\n\nThe severe flooding was caused by very heavy rainfall over a period of 1-2 days, wet conditions already before the event and local hydrological factors. While river discharge and water levels are the physical components most directly linked to the impacts of the event, we focus our assessment on the main meteorological driver, the heavy rainfall event. This is due to the fact that some hydrological monitoring systems were destroyed during the flood and data of sufficiently high quality and quantity is not currently available.\n\nThe observed rainfall amounts in the Ahr/Erft and the Belgian part of the Meuse catchment broke historically observed rainfall records by large margins. In regions of that size the robust estimation of return values and the detection and attribution of trends is challenging and thus pushes the limits of what current methods of extreme event attribution are designed for.\n\nTherefore we broadened the analysis by assessing the influence of climate change on similar types of events that could occur anywhere in Western Europe in a large region between the north of the Alps and the Netherlands. We found that in the current climate, for a given location within this larger region, we can on average expect one such event every 400 years. That also means we expect such events to occur more frequently than once in 400 years within the larger Western European region.\n\nClimate change increased the intensity of the maximum 1-day rainfall event in the summer season in this large region by about 3 \xe2\x80\x93 19% compared to a global climate 1.2 \xc2\xb0C cooler than today. The increase is similar for the 2-day event.\n\nThe likelihood of such an event to occur today compared to a 1.2 \xc2\xb0C cooler climate has increased by a factor between 1.2 and 9 for the 1-day event in the large region. The increase is again similar for the 2-day event.\n\nThese numbers are based on an assessment including observations, regional climate models and very high resolution climate models that directly simulate convection. The changes in intensity and likelihood are larger in the observation-based assessment compared to all models.\n\nIn a climate 2 \xc2\xb0C warmer than in preindustrial times models suggest that the intensity of a 1-day event would increase by a further 0.8-6% and the likelihood by a factor of 1.2-1.4. The increase is again similar for the 2-day event.\n\nThe July 2021 floods resulted in extreme impacts including over two hundred deaths. Given the rarity of the event it is clear this is a very extreme event that is reasonably likely to cause negative impacts. However, especially given events like this will occur more frequently in the future, examining how vulnerability and exposure can be reduced becomes critical to reducing future impacts.\n\nIn summary, our results highlight that at local scale detection of extreme precipitation trends is hindered by variability, but when considering such events occurring over the larger Western Europe region, significant trends attributable to human-induced climate change are evident even if we cannot predict where exactly these events occur. All available evidence taken together, including physical understanding, observations over a larger region and different regional climate models give high confidence that human-induced climate change has increased the likelihood and intensity of such an event to occur and these changes will continue in a rapidly warming climate.'";"Other";"1197.txt-Other"

"121.txt";"b'When most of us hear the word chocolate, we picture a bar, a box of bonbons, or a bunny. The verb that comes to mind is probably ""eat,"" not ""drink,"" and the most apt adjective would seem to be ""sweet."" But for about 90 percent of chocolate\'s long history, it was strictly a beverage, and sugar didn\'t have anything to do with it.\n\n""I often call chocolate the best-known food that nobody knows anything about,"" said Alexandra Leaf, a self-described ""chocolate educator"" who runs a business called Chocolate Tours of New York City.\n\nThe terminology can be a little confusing, but most experts these days use the term ""cacao"" to refer to the plant or its beans before processing, while the term ""chocolate"" refers to anything made from the beans, she explained. ""Cocoa"" generally refers to chocolate in a powdered form, although it can also be a British form of ""cacao.""\n\nEtymologists trace the origin of the word ""chocolate"" to the Aztec word ""xocoatl,"" which referred to a bitter drink brewed from cacao beans. The Latin name for the cacao tree, Theobroma cacao, means ""food of the gods.""\n\nMany modern historians have estimated that chocolate has been around for about 2000 years, but recent research suggests that it may be even older.\n\nIn the book The True History of Chocolate, authors Sophie and Michael Coe make a case that the earliest linguistic evidence of chocolate consumption stretches back three or even four millennia, to pre-Columbian cultures of Mesoamerica such as the Olmec.\n\nLast November, anthropologists from the University of Pennsylvania announced the discovery of cacao residue on pottery excavated in Honduras that could date back as far as 1400 B.C.E. It appears that the sweet pulp of the cacao fruit, which surrounds the beans, was fermented into an alcoholic beverage of the time.\n\n""Who would have thought, looking at this, that you can eat it?"" said Richard Hetzler, executive chef of the caf\xc3\xa9 at the Smithsonian\'s National Museum of the American Indian, as he displayed a fresh cacao pod during a recent chocolate-making demonstration. ""You would have to be pretty hungry, and pretty creative!""\n\nIt\'s hard to pin down exactly when chocolate was born, but it\'s clear that it was cherished from the start. For several centuries in pre-modern Latin America, cacao beans were considered valuable enough to use as currency. One bean could be traded for a tamale, while 100 beans could purchase a good turkey hen, according to a 16th-century Aztec document.\n\nBoth the Mayans and Aztecs believed the cacao bean had magical, or even divine, properties, suitable for use in the most sacred rituals of birth, marriage and death. According to Chloe Doutre-Roussel\'s book The Chocolate Connoisseur, Aztec sacrifice victims who felt too melancholy to join in ritual dancing before their death were often given a gourd of chocolate (tinged with the blood of previous victims) to cheer them up. Sweetened chocolate didn\'t appear until Europeans discovered the Americas and sampled the native cuisine. Legend has it that the Aztec king Montezuma welcomed the Spanish explorer Hernando Cortes with a banquet that included drinking chocolate, having tragically mistaken him for a reincarnated deity instead of a conquering invader. Chocolate didn\'t suit the foreigners\' tastebuds at first \xe2\x80\x93one described it in his writings as ""a bitter drink for pigs"" \xe2\x80\x93 but once mixed with honey or cane sugar, it quickly became popular throughout Spain. By the 17th century, chocolate was a fashionable drink throughout Europe, believed to have nutritious, medicinal and even aphrodisiac properties (it\'s rumored that Casanova was especially fond of the stuff). But it remained largely a privilege of the rich until the invention of the steam engine made mass production possible in the late 1700s. In 1828, a Dutch chemist found a way to make powdered chocolate by removing about half the natural fat (cacao butter) from chocolate liquor, pulverizing what remained and treating the mixture with alkaline salts to cut the bitter taste. His product became known as ""Dutch cocoa,"" and it soon led to the creation of solid chocolate. The creation of the first modern chocolate bar is credited to Joseph Fry, who in 1847 discovered that he could make a moldable chocolate paste by adding melted cacao butter back into Dutch cocoa. By 1868, a little company called Cadbury was marketing boxes of chocolate candies in England. Milk chocolate hit the market a few years later, pioneered by another name that may ring a bell \xe2\x80\x93 Nestle. In America, chocolate was so valued during the Revolutionary War that it was included in soldiers\' rations and used in lieu of wages. While most of us probably wouldn\'t settle for a chocolate paycheck these days, statistics show that the humble cacao bean is still a powerful economic force. Chocolate manufacturing is a more than 4-billion-dollar industry in the United States, and the average American eats at least half a pound of the stuff per month. In the 20th century, the word ""chocolate"" expanded to include a range of affordable treats with more sugar and additives than actual cacao in them, often made from the hardiest but least flavorful of the bean varieties (forastero). But more recently, there\'s been a ""chocolate revolution,"" Leaf said, marked by an increasing interest in high-quality, handmade chocolates and sustainable, effective cacao farming and harvesting methods. Major corporations like Hershey\'s have expanded their artisanal chocolate lines by purchasing smaller producers known for premium chocolates, such as Scharffen Berger and Dagoba, while independent chocolatiers continue to flourish as well.

"126.txt";"b'Is Chocolate Good for Your Heart?\n\nWhy a little, in moderation, may be beneficial\n\nChocolate has gotten a lot of media coverage in recent years because it\'s believed that it may help protect your cardiovascular system. The reasoning being that the cocoa bean is rich in a class of plant nutrients called flavonoids.\n\nFlavonoids help protect plants from environmental toxins and help repair damage. They can be found in a variety of foods, such as fruits and vegetables. When we eat foods rich in flavonoids, it appears that we also benefit from this ""antioxidant"" power.\n\nAntioxidants are believed to help the body\'s cells resist damage caused by free radicals that are formed by normal bodily processes, such as breathing, and from environmental contaminants, like cigarette smoke. If your body does not have enough antioxidants to combat the amount of oxidation that occurs, it can become damaged by free radicals. For example, an increase in oxidation can cause low-density lipoprotein (LDL), also known as ""bad"" cholesterol, to form plaque on the artery walls.\n\nFlavanols are the main type of flavonoid found in cocoa and chocolate. In addition to having antioxidant qualities, research shows that flavanols have other potential influences on vascular health, such as lowering blood pressure, improving blood flow to the brain and heart, and making blood platelets less sticky and able to clot.\n\nThese plant chemicals aren\xe2\x80\x99t only found in chocolate. In fact, a wide variety of foods and beverages are rich in flavonols. These include cranberries, apples, peanuts, onions, tea and red wine.\n\nAre all types of chocolate healthy?\n\nBefore you grab a chocolate candy bar or slice of chocolate cake, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand that not all forms of chocolate contain high levels of flavanols.\n\nCocoa naturally has a very strong, pungent taste, which comes from the flavanols. When cocoa is processed into your favorite chocolate products, it goes through several steps to reduce this taste. The more chocolate is processed (through things like fermentation, alkalizing, roasting, etc.), the more flavanols are lost.\n\nMost commercial chocolates are highly processed. Although it was once believed that dark chocolate contained the highest levels of flavanols, recent research indicates that, depending on how the dark chocolate was processed, this may not be true. The good news is that most major chocolate manufacturers are looking for ways to keep the flavanols in their processed chocolates. But for now, your best choices are likely dark chocolate over milk chocolate (especially milk chocolate that is loaded with other fats and sugars) and cocoa powder that has not undergone Dutch processing (cocoa that is treated with an alkali to neutralize its natural acidity).\n\nWhat about all of the fat in chocolate?\n\nYou may be surprised to learn that chocolate isn\xe2\x80\x99t as bad for you as once believed.\n\nThe fat in chocolate comes from cocoa butter and is made up of equal amounts of oleic acid (a heart-healthy monounsaturated fat also found in olive oil), stearic and palmitic acids. Stearic and palmitic acids are forms of saturated fat. You may know that saturated fats are linked to increases in LDL cholesterol and the risk of heart disease.\n\nBut, research shows that stearic acid appears to have a neutral effect on cholesterol, neither raising nor lowering it. Although palmitic acid does affect cholesterol levels, it only makes up one-third of the fat calories in chocolate. Still, this does not mean you can eat all the dark chocolate you\xe2\x80\x99d like.\n\nFirst, be careful about the type of dark chocolate you choose: chewy caramel-marshmallow-nut-covered dark chocolate is by no means a heart-healthy food option. Watch out for those extra ingredients that can add lots of extra fat and calories. Second, there is currently no established serving size of chocolate to help you reap the cardiovascular benefits it may offer, and more research is needed in this area. However, we do know that you no longer need to feel guilty if you enjoy a small piece of dark chocolate once in a while.\n\nSo, for now, enjoy moderate portions of chocolate (e.g., 1 ounce) a few times per week, and don\xe2\x80\x99t forget to eat other flavonoid-rich foods like apples, red wine, tea, onions and cranberries.'";"Other";"126.txt-Other"

"133.txt";"b""Originally consumed as a bitter drink, it was prized as both an aphrodisiac and an energy booster.\n\nMankind\xe2\x80\x99s love affair with chocolate stretches back more than five millennia. Produced from the seeds of tropical cacao trees native to the rainforests of Central and South America, chocolate was long considered the \xe2\x80\x9cfood of the gods,\xe2\x80\x9d and later, a delicacy for the elite. But for most of its history, it was actually consumed as a bitter beverage rather than the sweet, edible treat it has become worldwide.\n\nWhat Is the Birthplace of Chocolate?\n\nMayan cacao drink Ren Photo/Getty Images\n\nArchaeologists have discovered the earliest traces of cacao in pottery used by the ancient Mayo-Chinchipe culture 5,300 years ago in the upper Amazon region of Ecuador. Chocolate played an important political, spiritual and economic role in ancient Mesoamerican civilizations, which ground roasted cacao beans into a paste that they mixed with water, vanilla, chili peppers and other spices to brew a frothy chocolate drink.\n\nAncient Mesoamericans believed chocolate was an energy booster and aphrodisiac with mystical and medicinal qualities. The Mayans, who considered cacao a gift from the gods, used chocolate for sacred ceremonies and funeral offerings. Wealthy Mayans drank foaming chocolate drinks, while commoners consumed chocolate in a cold porridge-like dish.\n\nAs people of the Aztec empire spread across Mesoamerica in the 1400s, they too began to prize cacao. Since they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t grow it in the dry highlands of central Mexico, they traded with the Mayans for the beans, which they even used as currency. (In the 1500s, Aztecs could purchase a turkey hen or a hare for 100 beans.) By one account, the 16th-century Aztec ruler Moctezuma II drank 50 cups of chocolate a day out of a golden goblet to increase his libido.\n\nWATCH: Season 1 of The Food That Built America without signing in now.\n\nSpaniards Introduce Chocolate to Europe\xe2\x80\x99s Elite\n\nChocolate arrived in Europe during the 1500s, likely brought by both Spanish friars and conquistadors who had traveled to the Americas. Although the Spanish sweetened the bitter drink with cane sugar and cinnamon, one thing remained unchanged: Chocolate reigned as a delectable symbol of luxury, wealth and power\xe2\x80\x94an expensive import sipped by royal lips, and affordable only to Spanish elites.\n\nChocolate\xe2\x80\x99s popularity eventually spread to other European courts, where aristocrats consumed it as a magic elixir with health benefits. To slake their growing thirst for chocolate, European powers established colonial plantations in equatorial regions around the world to grow cacao and sugar. When diseases brought by Europeans depleted the native Mesoamerican labor pool, African slaves were imported to the Americas to work on the plantations and maintain chocolate production.\n\nChocolate remained an aristocratic nectar until the 1828 invention of the cocoa press revolutionized its production. Attributed in varying accounts to either Dutch chemist Coenraad Johannes van Houten or his father, Casparus, the cocoa press squeezed the fatty butter from roasted cacao beans, leaving behind a dry cake that could be pulverized into a fine powder that could be mixed with liquids and other ingredients, poured into molds and solidified into edible, easily digestible chocolate. The cocoa press ushered in the modern era of chocolate by enabling it to be used as a confectionary ingredient, and the resulting drop in production costs made chocolate much more affordable.\n\nREAD MORE: Why the Candy Bar Market Exploded After WWI\n\nChocolate Becomes a Treat for the Masses\n\n10 Gallery 10 Images\n\nIn 1847, British chocolate company J.S. Fry & Sons created the first edible chocolate bar from cocoa butter, cocoa powder and sugar. Rival chocolatier Cadbury\xe2\x80\x99s, credited with pioneering the Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day chocolate box and chocolate Easter egg, followed suit soon after and in 1854 earned a royal warrant as purveyors of chocolate to Queen Victoria.\n\nIt was in Switzerland that chocolate production took one of its greatest leaps forward. In the 1870s, Swiss chocolatier Daniel Peter utilized a powdered milk developed several years earlier by his neighbor Henri Nestl\xc3\xa9 to produce the first milk chocolate bar, and the pair eventually formed the Nestl\xc3\xa9 Company. Swiss chocolatier Rodolphe Lindt\xe2\x80\x99s 1879 invention of the conching machine\xe2\x80\x94which used large stone rollers to mix and aerate chocolate to give it a velvety texture and superior taste\xe2\x80\x94allowed for the mass production of smooth, creamy milk chocolate.\n\nIn the United States, Milton Hershey pioneered the assembly-line production of milk chocolate. After selling his caramel candy company for $1 million and producing his first milk chocolate bar in 1900, Hershey bought farmland near his birthplace in rural Pennsylvania and built an entire factory town devoted to chocolate. The grass-fed Holsteins on the surrounding dairy farms supplied the company\xe2\x80\x99s milk, and a company town in Cuba supplied its sugar.\n\nREAD MORE: How Hershey's Chocolate Helped Power Allied Troops in WWII\n\nChocolate bars soared in popularity during the Roaring Twenties. By the end of the decade, more than 40,000 different candy bars were being made in the U.S., according to Susan Benjamin, candy historian and author of Sweet as Sin: The Unwrapped Story of How Candy Became America\xe2\x80\x99s Favorite Pleasure. Father-and-son duo Frank C. Mars and Forrest Mars Sr. collaborated on the idea for the Milky Way bar, which hit the market in 1923 with the chocolate for its coating supplied by Hershey\xe2\x80\x99s. The family-owned business would rival Hershey\xe2\x80\x99s, and Forrest Mars Sr. later partnered with the son of a Hershey\xe2\x80\x99s executive to begin production of M&M candies in 1941.\n\nH.B. Reese, who had worked as a dairy farmer and shipping foreman for Hershey\xe2\x80\x99s, launched his own candy company in 1923 and five years later introduced Reese\xe2\x80\x99s Peanut Butter Cups. They later came to be produced by Hershey\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94and one of the top-selling candies in the United States.\n\nFrom its roots more than 5,000 years ago, chocolate has become a big business. According to research by Statista, retail sales of chocolate worldwide in 2016 totaled nearly $100 billion, including almost $25 billion in the United States alone. While the cacao plant is native to the Americas, its cultivation has now shifted to Africa, which is now the source of more than two-thirds of worldwide cocoa production.\n\nWATCH: Full episodes of The Food That Built America online now.""";"Other";"133.txt-Other"

"160.txt";"b'Cocoa butter composition\n\nPrior to any refining, the fatty-acid composition of the CB used in this study was determined by gas-liquid chromatography. The CB used in this study is mainly composed of stearic acid (37.3%), palmitic acid (25.4%), and oleic acid (33.5%) (Supplementary Table 1), which closely matches typical literature values4. The phosphorus content of the unrefined CB is 88 \xc2\xb1 1 ppm, or 0.263 \xc2\xb1 0.004% equivalent phosphatides by weight (Supplementary Table 2), which is similar to the 0.34 \xc2\xb1 0.07% reported by Arruda and Dimick6. After refining, the phospholipids are completely removed from the CB. The FFA content of the unrefined CB is 1.65 \xc2\xb1 0.01% (as oleic acid) (Supplementary Table 3), which complies with the requirement of having <1.75% FFAs as oleic acid in Codex standards. This is reduced to 0.06% after neutralization and bleaching.\n\nCrystal structure and polymorphism\n\nPowder X-ray diffraction is the most unambiguous method for determining CB TAG polymorphism. In this study, CB samples were melted at 80 \xc2\xb0C for 30 min to clear the memory of crystallization and then crystallized statically at 23 \xc2\xb0C in an incubator for 1 day. Form IV displays wide-angle reflections corresponding to short spacings of 4.35, 4.15, 3.97, and 3.81 \xc3\x85, Form V has short spacings of 4.58, 3.98, 3.87, 3.75, and 3.67 \xc3\x85, while Form VI has short spacings of 4.59, 3.86, and 3.70 \xc3\x8510. Unrefined CB displays reflections corresponding to short spacings of 4.61, 3.88, and 3.71 \xc3\x85, which is characteristic of Form VI, matching literature values closely (Fig. 1; Supplementary Table 4)10. Additionally, the small-angle reflections corresponding to long spacings of 68.16 and 32.89 \xc3\x85 further suggest a Form VI polymorphism and a 3 L structure (polytype)11. CB TAGs in Forms V and VI stack as lamellae in the [001] direction with a dimension, which is proportional to three fatty-acid chain lengths, hence the nomenclature \xe2\x80\x9c3 L\xe2\x80\x9d. Other polymorphic forms stack as 2 L structures, the more common polytypic arrangement12.\n\nFig. 1: Powder X-ray diffraction patterns and differential scanning calorimetric traces (inset) of unrefined native CB, refined CB, and refined CB with added minor lipidic components. Samples included a unrefined native CB, b refined CB, c refined CB with added 0.1% (w/w) dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, and d refined CB with added 0.1% (w/w) dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine. Samples were crystallized statically at 23 \xc2\xb0C for 24 h. Full size image\n\nIn contrast, the refined CB sample displays a pattern that resembles a blend of Forms IV and V. Short spacings of 4.35 and 4.18 \xc3\x85 agree with literature values for Form IV, while 4.60, 3.99, 3.88, and 3.77 \xc3\x85 match those of Form V11. Furthermore, the long spacings include both 2 L (45.20 \xc3\x85) and 3 L (65.57 and 32.69 \xc3\x85) arrangements, indicative of the presence of Forms IV and V, respectively11. Thus, it appears that the removal of minor components in CB through refining drastically changes the crystal structure of CB.\n\nThe wide-angle region of powder XRD spectra of refined CB with minor components added back is generally characteristic of Form V, or a blend of Forms IV and V (Fig. 1c, d and Supplementary Fig. 1 (a\xe2\x80\x93f)). In the small-angle region, diffraction patterns suggest that the 3 L structure is present in all samples. Long spacings in the range 64\xe2\x80\x9368 \xc3\x85 correspond to the reflections of the (001) crystal plane. Higher-order reflections, up to ones corresponding to the (009) plane of this lamellar crystal, are also evident. However, there is also varying amounts of the 2 L structure present in the various samples, specifically Form IV, which imparts undesirable properties and stability to CB and chocolate, including a low melting point and excessive softness12. The DMPC, GMP, GMO, and FFA samples have little to no 2 L structure present, indicated by the lack of a (001) plane reflection corresponding to ~45 \xc3\x85. In contrast, DPPE and GMS CB samples display a strong 2 L reflection, suggesting a mixture of 2 L and 3 L structures.\n\nMelting point and enthalpy of fusion\n\nThe melting points and enthalpies of fusion determined by DSC were compared across the CB samples and are shown in Table 1. Example DSC curves are presented for each sample in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2. Wille and Lutton reported the melting temperatures for Forms I through VI as 17.3, 23.3. 25.5, 27.5, 33.9, and 36.3 \xc2\xb0C10, while Lovegren et al.13 reported lower melting temperatures for the same six polymorphs as 13, 20, 23, 25, 30, and 33.5 \xc2\xb0C. The melting point of the unrefined CB used in our study closely matches that of Form VI, as reported by Willie and Lutton10. However, once the CB is refined, the melting point drops to 28.8 \xc2\xb0C, indicative of Form IV. After adding specific minor components back into the refined CB, the melting temperature increases again. Phospholipid and MAG addition to refined CB yield samples with melting points in the range of 29.8\xe2\x80\x9332.2 \xc2\xb0C, suggesting that the CB crystals are in transition from Form IV to Form V, as reported by Wille and Lutton10. Finally, when FFAs are added to refined CB, the melting temperature increases back to about 34 \xc2\xb0C, which may indicate a mixture of Forms V and VI, as it is also similar to Form VI\xe2\x80\x99s melting point of 33.5 \xc2\xb0C13. These results are all in agreement with the XRD data.\n\nTable 1 Melting point and enthalpy of fusion of unrefined native CB, refined CB, and refined CB with added minor lipidic components. Full size table\n\nThe enthalpies of fusion follow a similar trend, with a higher enthalpy of fusion (143.9 J/g) for unrefined CB, which decreases significantly after refining (110.9 J/g). Again, the phospholipids and MAGs have a much smaller effect, if any, compared to the FFAs. With the FFA samples, the enthalpies of fusion are similar to that of the unrefined CB. Guthrie reported an enthalpy of 147 J/g for Form V CB, which decreased for less stable forms14.\n\nCrystallization kinetics\n\nThe crystallization kinetics of the CB samples were quantified using half-times derived from the Avrami model fitted to the SFC-temperature data, as shown in Fig. 2, with the calculated Avrami constants shown in Supplementary Table 515.\n\nFig. 2: Static crystallization growth curve of unrefined native CB, refined CB, and refined CB with added minor lipidic components crystallized at 23 \xc2\xb0C (symbols) and corresponding fits to the Avrami model (solid lines). The inset table indicates the half-times of crystallization derived form model fits. Refining CB accelerates its crystallization (a), as does 0.1% (w/w) phospholipid addition (b). Addition of 0.5% (w/w) saturated monoacylglycerols, glycerol monostearate, and glycerol monopalmitate, do not significantly affect crystallization kinetics, while addition of the unsaturated glycerol monooletate does (c). Free fatty-acid addition to refined CB at 0.5% (w/w) levels accelerates crystallization for stearic, palmitic, and oleic acids equally (d). Values represent means and standard errors of three replicates and values with the same superscript letter are not significantly different (P > 0.05). Full size image\n\nUnrefined CB has the longest half-time of crystallization at 281.9 min, which decreases to 202.3 min after refining. Statistically significant decreases (P < 0.05) in the half time of crystallization of unrefined CB are observed after addition of DMPC, DPPE, GMO, and all free fatty acids tested, including palmitic, stearic, and oleic acids. Chaiseri and Dimick reported that different phospholipids had different effects on crystallization rate, with certain phospholipids such as lysophosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol retarding nucleation, while others such as phosphatidylcholine promoting nucleation. They also highlighted that removing phospholipids through refining decreased the crystallization rate, indicating that phospholids may be necessary as initial crystallization seeds in CB1. This agrees with the data presented in this study, with the addition of phospholipids increasing crystallization rate. Arruda and Dimick reported a much higher relative concentration of phospholipids in seed crystals than in bulk CB, with the majority being phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine6. Thus, it appears that the added phospholipids may aid in the nucleation of CB TAGs.\n\nThe FFA and GMO CB samples have a slightly shorter half-time of crystallization relative to the refined CB sample, but the effects of palmitic and oleic acid are not statistically significant (P > 0.05). M\xc3\xbcller and Careglio focused their study specifically on FFAs, and reported slower crystal growth of unrefined CB with added stearic, palmitic, and oleic acids7. However, we do not observe this in our study. Chaiseri and Dimick reported that saturated free fatty acids increased the crystallization rate in the early stages of CB crystallization1.\n\nFew studies have been conducted on the effect of MAGs on CB crystallization. Chaiseri and Dimick suggested that their effects are small due to their low concentration in CB1. In our study, GMS and GMP, both saturated monoglycerides, do not significantly affect CB crystallization kinetics. Surprisingly, the unsaturated monoglyceride GMO enhances CB crystallization.\n\nPolarized light microscopy\n\nLight microscopy revealed subtle differences in the microstructure of the different CB samples (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 3). Although all images display feather-like spherulitic structures, the unrefined sample has smaller spherulites. DPPE addition, interestingly, leads to the formation of larger spherulites with a different texture than upon DMPC addition. The spherulites of the refined and DPPE samples display granular structures in the centre of the spherulites and feather-like crystallites in the periphery. The MAG samples all exhibit similar crystal morphologies, with both granular structures and small feather-like spherulites present. This is similar to the stearic and palmitic acid samples, though the FFA samples display a more granular structure. It appears that the MAG and FFA samples, excluding the oleic acid sample, revert the CB to the morphology of the unrefined sample. However, the oleic acid sample differs greatly from the rest, displaying large spherulites analogous to the refined CB sample.\n\nFig. 3: Polarized light microscopy images of unrefined native CB, refined CB, and refined CB with and without added minor lipidic components. Samples included a unrefined native CB, b refined CB, c refined CB with added 0.1% (w/w) dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, and d refined CB with added 0.1% (w/w) dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine. Samples were crystallized statically at 23 \xc2\xb0C for 24 h. Intensity and contrast were auto-levelled. Full size image\n\nAn aspect that became clear during the microscopy studies is that the spatial distribution of mass of CB is affected by the refining process and subsequent addition of minor lipidic components. One way to quantify this spatial distribution of mass is by determining the box-counting fractal dimension (D box ) of the images. A high fractal dimension is associated with a greater fill of the available embedding space with crystalline mass, as well as a higher order in the distribution of this crystalline mass. The box-counting fractal dimension provides a value that quantifies the level of space-filling, as well as self-similarity within a structure, which can be related to the nucleation process of CB. Supplementary Table 6 lists these values. The unrefined and stearic acid samples have the lowest average fractal dimension, with D box = 1.63 and 1.62, respectively. In contrast, the sample with the highest fractal dimension is the refined sample at D box = 1.75, followed by the phospholipid samples at ~1.72. Samples with a higher fractal dimension are expected to have originated from a higher nucleation rate, as this leads to more homogenous growth across an area. On the other hand, slower nucleation rates would result in more heterogeneous growth, leading to a lower fractal dimension for the resulting mass distribution 16.\n\nInterestingly, here we also discovered a statistically significant (r = 0.77, P < 0.01) inverse correlation between the melting temperature of the samples and their fractal dimension, as shown in Fig. 4. This may be related to the polymorphism of each sample and its corresponding nucleation process. For the unrefined sample, a high melting temperature of 36.4 \xc2\xb0C indicates the presence of the Form VI polymorph. The higher free energy of nucleation for this most stable polymorph results in low nucleation rates, leading to a more heterogeneous mass distribution and a lower fractal dimension. Conversely, the lower melting temperature of the refined sample suggests a mixture of Forms IV and V, which are metastable polymorphs. These polymorphic forms have greater rates of nucleation, resulting in a more homogeneous mass distribution and a higher fractal dimension16.\n\nFig. 4: Global relationship between the box-counting fractal dimension (D box ) of polarized light microscopy images of CB samples and their corresponding melting temperature (T m ). Fractal dimension values plotted represent the means of six images, while melting temperature values plotted represent the means of three replicates. Full size image\n\nMechanical properties\n\nThe hardness of both CB and chocolate samples containing some of the minor components was determined by 3-point bending, and the elastic bending modulus calculated. The elastic bending moduli (E B ) of unrefined CB, refined CB, and DMPC CB are 44.1 \xc2\xb1 3.4, 35.4 \xc2\xb1 4.4, and 39.0 \xc2\xb1 3.7 N/mm2, respectively. There is no statistically significant difference between these values (P > 0.05). The melting temperatures for these samples are the same as well, with the average being 34.3 \xc2\xb1 0.1 \xc2\xb0C.\n\nFor the chocolate samples, the addition of phospholipids to molten commercial chocolate (90% cocoa solids) allows the chocolate to maintain hardness without complex tempering procedures, such as crystallization at 5 \xc2\xb0C for 1 h and subsequent storage at 20 \xc2\xb0C for 4 days. Other trials with static crystallization at 23 and 26 \xc2\xb0C yield chocolates with undesirable mechanical and surface properties, suggesting that the use of phospholipids to promote proper tempering still requires some optimization of crystallization temperatures. DMPC and DPPE were added chocolate at 0.1% (w/w) levels, and their properties were compared to commercial chocolate both directly from the package and recrystallized under the same conditions as the doped samples (Table 2). The E B is similar between the commercial chocolate and the phospholipid-containing samples, but is significantly lower for the recrystallized commercial chocolate (P < 0.05). When the chocolate is melted and recrystallized without any additive addition, it becomes much softer. A greater E B indicates a stiffer chocolate, relating to the property of snap, which is desirable in chocolate. However, DSC analysis revealed that all the chocolate samples have similar melting temperatures, all indicative of Form V CB crystals. XRD patterns further confirm the presence of Form V CB crystals in all samples (Fig. 5). Thus, it appears that the polymorphism of CB in chocolate does not wholly determine its mechanical properties, and these mechanical properties may be attributed to the microstructure instead.\n\nTable 2 Elastic bending modulus (E B ), melting temperature, and whiteness index (WI) of commercial chocolate samples with added phospholipids. Full size table\n\nFig. 5: Powder X-ray diffraction patterns for commercial chocolate with added minor lipidic components. Chocolate samples were molten, blended with the minor components and crystallized at 5 \xc2\xb0C for 1 h, followed by 20 \xc2\xb0C for 4 days. The a commercial chocolate, b molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate, c molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added 0.1% (w/w) dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, and d molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added 0.1% (w/w) dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine, all display powder X-ray diffraction patterns characteristic of well-tempered \xce\xb2 2 , triclinic, Form V cocoa butter crystals. This crystal form displays a strong reflection corresponding to a short spacing of ~4.6 \xc3\x85 in the wide-angle diffraction region, and characteristic wide-angle reflections in the 2\xce\xb8 region 20\xe2\x80\x9325\xc2\xb0. In the small-angle diffraction region, only reflections from the 3 L (001) plane corresponding to ~62\xe2\x80\x9363-\xc3\x85 were observed. The absence of reflections from (001) plane of the 2 L polytype indicates the formation of the optimal polytypic form in the cocoa butter in all samples. Reflections at higher angles in the small-angle region correspond to higher-order reflections for these two crystal planes. Full size image\n\nProper chocolate tempering typically focuses on the melting behavior of the chocolate, in other words, the polymorphism of the chocolate\xe2\x80\x99s CB triacylglycerol crystals2,3. However, there is little consideration for the microstructure and mechanical properties when determining whether chocolate has been properly tempered or not. Here we show that addition of DMPC and DPPE helps achieve the desired hardness and fracture properties in chocolate, without directly impacting the polymorphism. This likely results from changes in the microstructure of the underlying CB fat crystal network, which arises from the phospholipids affecting the nucleation behavior of the CB.\n\nSurface reflectance\n\nProper tempering of chocolate results in a smooth surface with high surface gloss17. Bloom, for example, is often characterized by the appearance of a grayish white film on the surface of chocolate, attributed to the uncontrolled polymorphic transformation from Form V to Form VI18. This white appearance is due to the presence of large surface crystals, which scatter light impinging upon them19. This can be quantified using the Whiteness Index (WI), calculated from RGB surface color measurements17. A higher WI indicates a greater level of fat bloom on the surface of the chocolate, or may also indicate a rougher surface. The WI for each of the chocolate samples is shown in Table 2. The commercial chocolate and the DMPC chocolate sample have similar WI, suggesting a properly tempered chocolate for the DMPC sample. Moreover, a statistically significant difference is evident between the DMPC chocolate sample and the recrystallized commercial chocolate sample (P < 0.05), which was not tempered properly. The lower WI of the DMPC chocolate sample suggests that the addition of this phospholipid aided in the stability of the chocolate, resulting in less fat bloom and/or a smoother surface compared to the recrystallized commercial chocolate sample. The effect of DPPE addition to molten and recrystallized chocolate is not as clear since the WI is not statistically different from the commercial, DMPC or molten and recrystallized chocolates.\n\nChocolate microstructure by synchrotron-based micro-computed tomography (SR-\xc2\xb5CT)\n\nSynchrotron \xc2\xb5CT analysis revealed similarities between chocolate microstructure among all samples imaged at a <450 \xc2\xb5m length scale. CT voxel intensity is directly proportional to material density. The number of voxels with a given intensity is then representative of the number of volume fractions with a given density in the analyzed volume. The molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate sample (Lindt-R) displays the largest difference between samples, with a narrowing and shift of the histogram compared to the fresh commercial chocolate (Lindt-F), molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added DMPC, and molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added DPPE. This indicates a difference in material structure upon recrystallization. This is visually represented in volume renderings where the most notable difference is a reduction in the green intensity for Lindt-R, compared to the Lindt-F, DMPC, and DPPE samples, as seen in Fig. 6. Volume rendering movies of each sample can be seen in the corresponding links in Fig. 6.\n\nFig. 6: Volume renderings of reconstructed slices, plotted histograms, and correlation matrix of SR-\xc2\xb5CT data. Samples included a molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added 0.1% (w/w) dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC), Supplementary Movie 1; b molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added 0.1% (w/w) dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DPPE), Supplementary Movie 2; c fresh commercial chocolate (Lindt-F), Supplementary Movie 3; d molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate (Lindt-R), Supplementary Movie 4; e plotted histograms, and f correlation matrix. Full size image\n\nA comparison of the histograms shows qualitative differences in the overall density distributions, which make up the sample volumes in the images. A correlation matrix was generated by inputting the voxel count values for each binned 16-bit gray-value and generating a table of correlation coefficients between the four chocolates density distributions. The correlation matrices show a high positive correlation in the material\xe2\x80\x99s density distribution regardless of treatment; however, the least variance is observed between DMPC vs. Lindt-F and DPPE vs. Lindt-F. The highest correlation coefficient is found between DMPC and fresh Lindt, and DPPE vs. fresh Lindt samples, with a value of 0.9987. This suggests that the complex microstructure of Lindt chocolate with added DMPC and DPPE and crystallized isothermally, is more similar to that of tempered fresh Lindt chocolate than without these additives.\n\nOverall, we find that the presence of various minor components within CB results in major changes to its polymorphism, crystallization kinetics, and crystal morphology. By refining CB through neutralization and bleaching, the unrefined CB transitioned from Form VI to a blend of Forms IV and V, in addition to displaying faster crystal growth. Although adding MAGs and FFAs back into refined CB results in some small differences, phospholipid addition has the largest impact.\n\nAt 0.1% (w/w) levels, DMPC and DPPE both significantly increase the crystal growth rate of refined CB. However, the DPPE sample exhibits significant amounts of the 2 L polytype, while the DMPC sample only displays 3 L polytypism, which is the more stable and preferred nanostructure. When added to a commercial chocolate sample, DMPC and DPPE both template the Form V polymorph with optimal mechanical properties, surface gloss and microstructure. This may allow for the production of chocolate products without the need for laborious and complex tempering protocols.\n\nProper tempering is often judged by the resulting melting temperature, a function of the CB polymorphic form2. However, as we show in this study, the various chocolate samples were all in Form V as determined by DSC and XRD analysis, but display different mechanical properties. This suggests that there is more to tempering than achieving the Form V polymorph, and important qualities such as gloss and snap may be heavily dependent on surface and bulk microstructure. Thus, DMPC, DPPE, and possibly other saturated phospholipids can potentially be employed as effective additives for engineering the crystallization behavior, polymorphism, nanostructure, and microstructure in CB and chocolate products.'";"Other";"160.txt-Other"
"169.txt";"b'Is chocolate toxic to dogs?\n\nYes, chocolate is toxic to dogs. While rarely fatal, chocolate ingestion can result in significant illness. Chocolate is toxic because it contains a chemical called theobromine, as well as caffeine. Theobromine is the main toxin in chocolate and is very similar to caffeine. Both chemicals are used medicinally as a diuretic, heart stimulant, blood vessel dilator, and a smooth muscle relaxant. Dogs cannot metabolize theobromine and caffeine as well as people can. That is why dogs are more sensitive to the chemicals\xe2\x80\x99 effects.\n\nHow much chocolate is poisonous to a dog?\n\nThe amount of toxic theobromine varies with the type of chocolate. The darker and more bitter the chocolate, the more dangerous it is to dogs. Baking chocolate and gourmet dark chocolate are highly concentrated and contain 130-450 mg of theobromine per ounce. Common milk chocolate only contains about 44-58 mg/ounce. White chocolate rarely poses any threat of chocolate poisoning with only 0.25 mg of theobromine per ounce of chocolate. Even if the amount ingested is not a toxicity concern, dogs can still become ill from the fat and sugar in chocolate. These can cause pancreatitis in severe cases or in dogs that have more sensitive stomachs. To put this in perspective, a medium-sized dog weighing 50 pounds would only need to eat 1 ounce of baker\'s chocolate, or 9 ounces of milk chocolate, to potentially show signs of poisoning. For many dogs, ingesting small amounts of milk chocolate is not harmful.\n\nWhat are the clinical signs of chocolate poisoning?\n\nClinical signs depend on the amount and type of chocolate ingested. For many dogs, the most common clinical signs are vomiting, diarrhea, increased thirst, panting or restlessness, excessive urination, and racing heart rate. In severe cases, symptoms can include muscle tremors, seizures, and heart failure. Complications such as developing aspiration pneumonia from vomiting, can make the prognosis for chocolate poisoning worse. When in doubt, immediate treatment by your veterinarian is recommended if a poisonous amount of chocolate is ingested.\n\n""Clinical signs of chocolate poisoning can take hours to develop and last for days.""\n\nClinical signs of chocolate poisoning can take several hours to develop. Signs due to large exposures can last for days due to the long half-life of theobromine. This means that it remains in the bloodstream for a longer period. Theobromine may be re-absorbed from the bladder, so intravenous fluids and frequent walks to encourage urination may be necessary. It is important to seek medical attention by calling your veterinarian or Pet Poison Helpline as soon as you suspect that your dog has eaten chocolate.\n\nWhat should I do if my dog eats chocolate?\n\nContact your veterinarian or Pet Poison Helpline to see if a poisonous amount of chocolate was ingested. If a toxic amount is ingested, you should have your dog examined by a veterinarian immediately. The sooner treatment begins, the better your dog\'s prognosis.\n\nWhat is the treatment for chocolate poisoning?\n\nTreatment depends on the amount and type of chocolate eaten. If treated early, decontamination including inducing vomiting and administering activated charcoal to prevent absorption of theobromine into the body may be all that is necessary. Treatments of activated charcoal may be repeated to reduce the continued resorption and recirculation of theobromine.\n\nIt is very common to provide supportive treatments such as intravenous fluid therapy to help stabilize a dog and promote theobromine excretion. All dogs ingesting a toxic amount of chocolate should be closely monitored for any signs of agitation, vomiting, diarrhea, nervousness, irregular heart rhythm, and high blood pressure. Medication to treat restlessness and other signs may also be necessary\n\nI saw a treat made for dogs that contains chocolate. Isn\'t this dangerous?\n\nMany gourmet dog treats use carob as a chocolate substitute.\n\n""Carob looks similar to chocolate and the two are often confused.""\n\nCarob looks similar to chocolate and the two are often confused. Some specialty dog bakeries will use a small amount of milk chocolate in treats. Since the amount of theobromine is typically low, this may be safe for most dogs. However, most veterinarians recommend that you avoid giving your dog chocolate in any form.\n\nPet Poison Helpline, an animal poison control center based out of Minneapolis, MN is available 24/7 for pet owners and veterinary professionals that require assistance treating a potentially poisoned pet. The staff provides treatment advice for poisoning cases of all species, including dogs, cats, birds, small mammals, large animals and exotic species. As the most cost-effective option for animal poison control care, Pet Poison Helpline\xe2\x80\x99s fee of $65 per incident includes follow-up consultations for the duration of the poison case.

"17.txt";"b'When most of us hear the word chocolate, we picture a bar, a box of bonbons, or a bunny. The verb that comes to mind is probably ""eat,"" not ""drink,"" and the most apt adjective would seem to be ""sweet."" But for about 90 percent of chocolate\'s long history, it was strictly a beverage, and sugar didn\'t have anything to do with it.\n\n""I often call chocolate the best-known food that nobody knows anything about,"" said Alexandra Leaf, a self-described ""chocolate educator"" who runs a business called Chocolate Tours of New York City.\n\nThe terminology can be a little confusing, but most experts these days use the term ""cacao"" to refer to the plant or its beans before processing, while the term ""chocolate"" refers to anything made from the beans, she explained. ""Cocoa"" generally refers to chocolate in a powdered form, although it can also be a British form of ""cacao.""\n\nEtymologists trace the origin of the word ""chocolate"" to the Aztec word ""xocoatl,"" which referred to a bitter drink brewed from cacao beans. The Latin name for the cacao tree, Theobroma cacao, means ""food of the gods.""\n\nMany modern historians have estimated that chocolate has been around for about 2000 years, but recent research suggests that it may be even older.\n\nIn the book The True History of Chocolate, authors Sophie and Michael Coe make a case that the earliest linguistic evidence of chocolate consumption stretches back three or even four millennia, to pre-Columbian cultures of Mesoamerica such as the Olmec.\n\nLast November, anthropologists from the University of Pennsylvania announced the discovery of cacao residue on pottery excavated in Honduras that could date back as far as 1400 B.C.E. It appears that the sweet pulp of the cacao fruit, which surrounds the beans, was fermented into an alcoholic beverage of the time.\n\n""Who would have thought, looking at this, that you can eat it?"" said Richard Hetzler, executive chef of the caf\xc3\xa9 at the Smithsonian\'s National Museum of the American Indian, as he displayed a fresh cacao pod during a recent chocolate-making demonstration. ""You would have to be pretty hungry, and pretty creative!""\n\nIt\'s hard to pin down exactly when chocolate was born, but it\'s clear that it was cherished from the start. For several centuries in pre-modern Latin America, cacao beans were considered valuable enough to use as currency. One bean could be traded for a tamale, while 100 beans could purchase a good turkey hen, according to a 16th-century Aztec document.\n\nBoth the Mayans and Aztecs believed the cacao bean had magical, or even divine, properties, suitable for use in the most sacred rituals of birth, marriage and death. According to Chloe Doutre-Roussel\'s book The Chocolate Connoisseur, Aztec sacrifice victims who felt too melancholy to join in ritual dancing before their death were often given a gourd of chocolate (tinged with the blood of previous victims) to cheer them up. Sweetened chocolate didn\'t appear until Europeans discovered the Americas and sampled the native cuisine. Legend has it that the Aztec king Montezuma welcomed the Spanish explorer Hernando Cortes with a banquet that included drinking chocolate, having tragically mistaken him for a reincarnated deity instead of a conquering invader. Chocolate didn\'t suit the foreigners\' tastebuds at first \xe2\x80\x93one described it in his writings as ""a bitter drink for pigs"" \xe2\x80\x93 but once mixed with honey or cane sugar, it quickly became popular throughout Spain. By the 17th century, chocolate was a fashionable drink throughout Europe, believed to have nutritious, medicinal and even aphrodisiac properties (it\'s rumored that Casanova was especially fond of the stuff). But it remained largely a privilege of the rich until the invention of the steam engine made mass production possible in the late 1700s. In 1828, a Dutch chemist found a way to make powdered chocolate by removing about half the natural fat (cacao butter) from chocolate liquor, pulverizing what remained and treating the mixture with alkaline salts to cut the bitter taste. His product became known as ""Dutch cocoa,"" and it soon led to the creation of solid chocolate. The creation of the first modern chocolate bar is credited to Joseph Fry, who in 1847 discovered that he could make a moldable chocolate paste by adding melted cacao butter back into Dutch cocoa. By 1868, a little company called Cadbury was marketing boxes of chocolate candies in England. Milk chocolate hit the market a few years later, pioneered by another name that may ring a bell \xe2\x80\x93 Nestle. In America, chocolate was so valued during the Revolutionary War that it was included in soldiers\' rations and used in lieu of wages. While most of us probably wouldn\'t settle for a chocolate paycheck these days, statistics show that the humble cacao bean is still a powerful economic force. Chocolate manufacturing is a more than 4-billion-dollar industry in the United States, and the average American eats at least half a pound of the stuff per month. In the 20th century, the word ""chocolate"" expanded to include a range of affordable treats with more sugar and additives than actual cacao in them, often made from the hardiest but least flavorful of the bean varieties (forastero). But more recently, there\'s been a ""chocolate revolution,"" Leaf said, marked by an increasing interest in high-quality, handmade chocolates and sustainable, effective cacao farming and harvesting methods. Major corporations like Hershey\'s have expanded their artisanal chocolate lines by purchasing smaller producers known for premium chocolates, such as Scharffen Berger and Dagoba, while independent chocolatiers continue to flourish as well. ""I see more and more American artisans doing incredible things with chocolate,"" Leaf said. ""Although, I admit that I tend to look at the world through cocoa-tinted glasses.""'";"Other";"17.txt-Other"

If you know your dog has eaten chocolate, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to monitor him for signs of toxicity (see below), and it\xe2\x80\x99s recommended that you contact your veterinarian or the Pet Poison Helpline (855-213-6680, fee applies) for advice.\n\nLearn how much is too much, which types of chocolate are the most dangerous, and what signs to look for that may signal your dog needs treatment.\n\nWhy Chocolate Is Toxic to Dogs\n\nChocolate contains both theobromine and caffeine, both of which can speed the heart rate and stimulate the nervous system of dogs, the Merck/Merial Manual for Veterinary Health explains. The risk of your dog becoming sick from ingesting chocolate depends on the type and amount of chocolate consumed and the weight of the dog (calculate your dog\xe2\x80\x99s risk of toxicity with this easy-to-use program). The concentrations of these toxic substances vary among different types of chocolates. Here are a few types of chocolate listed in order of theobromine content:\n\nCocoa powder (most toxic) Unsweetened baker\xe2\x80\x99s chocolate Semisweet chocolate Dark chocolate Milk chocolate\n\nKnowing how much and what kind of chocolate your dog ate can help you and your vet determine if you have an emergency. In general, mild symptoms of chocolate toxicity occur when a dog consumes 20 mg of methylxanthines per kilogram of body weight. Cardiac symptoms of chocolate toxicity occur around 40 to 50 mg/kg, and seizures occur at dosages greater than 60 mg/kg.\n\nIn simpler terms, that means a very concerning dose of chocolate is approximately one ounce of milk chocolate per pound of body weight. Since an average Hershey\xe2\x80\x99s Milk Chocolate bar is 1.55 ounces, consuming even one chocolate bar can have serious consequences, especially for small dogs. Eating a crumb of chocolate cake or a very small piece of a chocolate bar, on the other hand, probably won\xe2\x80\x99t kill your dog, especially if it is a larger breed, but chocolate should never be fed as a treat.\n\nWhat are the Signs of Chocolate Poisoning?\n\nSigns of chocolate poisoning usually appear within 6 to 12 hours after your dog has eaten it, may last up to 72 hours, and include the following:\n\nVomiting\n\nDiarrhea\n\nRestlessness\n\nIncreased urination\n\nTremors\n\nElevated or abnormal heart rate\n\nSeizures\n\nCollapse and death\n\nNote: Older dogs and dogs with heart conditions are more at risk of sudden death from chocolate poisoning.\n\nWhat to Do If Your Dog Ate Chocolate\n\nIf you believe your dog ate chocolate, call your veterinarian immediately or call the Pet Poison Helpline (855-213-6680) for advice. Based on your dog\xe2\x80\x99s size and the amount and type of chocolate consumed, your veterinarian may recommend that you monitor your dog for the clinical signs listed above and call back if his condition worsens.\n\nIn other cases, the veterinarian may prefer you bring the dog into the clinic. If your pet consumed the chocolate less than two hours ago, your veterinarian may induce vomiting and give him several doses of activated charcoal, which works to move the toxins out of the body without being absorbed into the bloodstream. For more severe cases, veterinary intervention may be needed to provide supplemental treatment, such as medications or IV fluids, to resolve the effects of the poisoning. Dogs suffering from seizures may need to be monitored at the clinic overnight.\n\nHow to Prevent Your Dog from Eating Chocolate\n\nEven though small amounts of milk chocolate may not cause a problem in larger dogs, it\xe2\x80\x99s still not recommended that pet owners offer their dog chocolate as a treat. To prevent your dog from sneaking chocolate, follow these tips:\n\nPut it away: Make sure all chocolate items, including cocoa powder and hot chocolate mix, are stored where the dog cannot reach them, such as on a high shelf in a closed-door pantry. Remind your children and guests that chocolate should be kept out of the dog\xe2\x80\x99s reach and not left on countertops, tables, or in purses. Keep this in mind during the holidays, too, making sure to place trick-or-treat bags, Easter baskets, Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day candy, Christmas stockings, and Hanukkah coins (gelt), for example, in a place where a dog cannot get to them.\n\nTeach \xe2\x80\x9cleave it\xe2\x80\x9d: The command \xe2\x80\x9cleave it\xe2\x80\x9d is extremely effective in preventing dogs from eating something that falls onto the ground or is left within reach during a walk. It\xe2\x80\x99s also a very easy command to teach.\n\nCrate train your dog: The safest way to ensure your dog doesn\xe2\x80\x99t eat anything harmful while you\xe2\x80\x99re not supervising him is to crate train him. Find a sturdy crate that is large enough for your dog to stand up and turn around and make it a comfortable, safe place for him to retreat to when he wants to be alone or when you can\xe2\x80\x99t watch him. Offer toys, a stuffed Kong, a favorite blanket, and treats to help him feel like the crate is his personal den.

"193.txt";"b""Many home chefs know that tempering chocolate to achieve a perfect finish and a satisfying 'snap' is no easy feat. Small variations in the quality of ingredients, temperature, mixing and timing can all set you up to fail, even when you learn from the best.\n\nThe results of a new study by food scientists from the University of Guelph in Canada suggest the addition of two common, naturally occurring fats \xe2\x80\x93 in the right proportions \xe2\x80\x93 might make chocolate tempering less of a gamble.\n\nPick up just about any block of milk chocolate from your local store, and you'll find it's more or less made out of the same things \xe2\x80\x93 cocoa butter for the form, cocoa mass (or chocolate liquor) for that familiar bitter taste, and additives like sugar or vanilla for sweetness and flavor.\n\nCrafting a solid bar of chocolate is a matter of encouraging the right size and distribution of crystals. In chocolate, crystalline forms of cocoa butter triglycerides (TAGs) are what give the food its characteristic shine, smooth texture, brittleness, and melting point.\n\nNot just any crystalline structure will do, either. Of the six distinct configurations of this class of molecule known to exist, Form V is the one that gives us a perfect temper.\n\nTempering \xe2\x80\x93 transforming the diverse mix of molecules into something that resists your bite while feeling heavenly smooth on your tongue \xe2\x80\x93 is a culinary process that has been gradually perfected over time, relying on a fine-tuned sequence of heating, mixing, and cooling.\n\nWhile researchers have investigated the influence TAG composition has on the success of tempering, little is known about how minor components of cocoa butter might make or break the process, including things like free fatty acids and phospholipids.\n\nGiven they make up just a few percent of the chemicals in cocoa butter, differences in their origins and refining might significantly alter the make-up of this key ingredient, either by helping the right crystals generate or interfering with their growth.\n\nPrevious research hinted at roles certain minor components had in the formation of the 'seed' crystals. For example, having a lot of free fatty acids seems to poison the crystallization process. Phospholipids, on the other hand, appeared to help them grow.\n\nTo nail down the precise proportions and chemical nature of these components, the researchers analyzed the exact make-up of a sample of cocoa butter, varying its composition by adding ingredients or bleaching out existing ones.\n\nThey then subjected it to a variety of tests to determine how variations in fat content might affect the growth time and proportion of crystal types, as well as things like melting point, surface reflection, micro-structure, and flex.\n\nWhile the amount of molecules such as free fatty acids had some effect, the real game-changer was the proportion of phospholipids, specifically saturated phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. Don't let the tongue-twister names fool you, though: these are garden variety biological molecules found in the membranes of living cells.\n\nBoth of these molecules in higher concentrations saw to the formation of Form V crystals, giving the cocoa butter the optimal glass, micro-structure, and mechanical properties.\n\nAdding the right amount of each to chocolate just might take the anxiety out of the tempering process, either by simplifying it or even eliminating it altogether.\n\nThis won't necessarily turn all of us into home kitchen dessertiers. But for professionals relying on recipes they can count on, knowing a little more about the chemistry of their chocolate creations just might give them the formula they need.\n\nThis research was published in Nature Communications.""";"Other";"193.txt-Other"
"194.txt";"b'COFFEE CHOCOLATE CHIP GELATO is rated 4.4 out of 5 by 114 .\n\nRated 4 out of 5 by Kikiii from Um, YUM! I had been wanting something sweet and since it was so hot outside, I decided I wanted ice cream. At the store, I saw the talenti pints of gelato and thought, ""how cute, I can reuse these."" I chose the coffee chocolate chip and I\'m so glad I did. It is creamy, has a full coffee flavor, and the chips are so thin and small they just melt away. I normally dislike chips in my frozen treats, but like I said, these just melted away nicely. My husband chose a the Belgian chocolate flavor and we were both disappointed with it compared to the coffee one. I ended up having to share mine with him which was fine since it is so rich I could only eat a little at a time.\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by DoctorEsq from Outstanding I have never been a coffee lover. Yes, in today\'s coffee addicted world that\'s strange but there you have it. I am, however, a tried and true Chocoholic. Yet the way Talenti has blended traditional coffee flavor with chocolate chips is truly outstanding. And the texture is perfect ~ a bit more solid then the other chocolate chip flavors especially in contrast to the Mediterranean Mint, Chocolate Chip, Peppermint Bark, etc ~ although all yummy, they melt far to quickly for my taste as I enjoy savoring the experience!! True, I pretty much love just about all the Talenti flavors and eat 1/2 a pint every night for my treat. But Talenti\'s Coffee Chocolate Chip has become one of my favorite flavors!\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by Auditory from This is what coffee flavor is all about In the mid-1960s when I was just a tot, my Sisters used to take me to a little shack that doubled as an ice cream parlor. The place featured a big name ice cream brand that is still one of the major players today. That\'s where I had my first taste of a coffee flavored frozen confection. Regrettably, the band name product today tastes nothing like I remembered it to have been. Fortunately, Talenti gelato has made that memory come back to life. With every spoonful, there is no guessing where the flavor is. Talenti has crafted a frozen dessert with an uncompromisingly strong coffee flavor that punches the tastebuds every time.\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by Kath12 from Delicious! My favorite ice cream flavor since I was young was Mocha. That flavor has disappeared. One night my daughter brought over brownies with a complimentary Talenti flavor. I fell in love with this gelato. Next time I went shopping I decided to buy the coffee with the chocolate chips. The first spoonful brought back the flavor I had longer for. It is now my nightly treat. All I need is 2-3 tablespoons full and I am totally satisfied until the next night. Sometimes I will mix it with one of your vanilla flavors & it is so yummy! No longer am I searching for this delicious flavor. I am totally hooked on Talenti brand gelato. I have enjoyed every flavor so far & I still have many more to try.\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by Baddie13 from Great Ice Cream This ice cream is delicious and is a great blend. I can taste the coffee and chocolate chips great together.\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by Mina from My life is now complete I was having a miserable day and I saw this in the store. Not much of a coffee person unless it\'s loaded with chocolate. Tried this as one of those what-the-hey-I\'ll-give-it-a-try moments and that first taste? [Insert angels singing here] DE-LOVIN-LICIOUS!!! The perfect amount of coffee taste, a ton of chocolate chips so no spoonful is left wanting, and my day got infinitely better after I downed half the jar in five minutes. Perfection in a jar. My only problem is trying to make it last before I can buy more! Yum yum yummy yummy yum! :D\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by best one so far from Best one so far Previous flavors I tried were super hard to open because they spilled gelato on the edge, making it extremely difficult to open. These were finally clean so it was easy to open. That was the first major PLUS in my book. Then I tried the gelato and was so impressed. It\'s the best coffee flavor I\'ve ever tasted. It\'s bolder than any other coffee flavored brands I\'ve tried so far. Normally I don\'t like ""stuff"" in my ice cream/gelato, but the ""chips"" in this one is more like shavings so it\'s not as noticeable (unlike their Double Dark Chocolate gelato which has chucks of chips). Best flavor so far from Talenti.'";"Other";"194.txt-Other"

"196.txt";"b'For a year or so in high school, I\xe2\x80\x99d buy a peanut butter Kudos bar in the cafeteria at lunch time, then eat it slowly on the walk home. Kudos, for those who never had the pleasure, were a kind of granola-candy bar hybrid made by Mars that debuted in the late \xe2\x80\x9980s. Comprising a granola bar topped by a peanut butter layer pebbled with crispy rice, the whole thing enrobed in waxy chocolate, those slim bars fueled my adolescence.\n\nSo maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s no wonder that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been craving the combination of peanut butter and chocolate as I prepare to send my own children back to school \xe2\x80\x94 real, in-person, full-time school \xe2\x80\x94 for the first time in a long time. Kudos have been long since discontinued, but the appeal of a bar made with good peanut butter and excellent chocolate has not gone out of style among children or their mothers, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to report.\n\nThough these bars are inspired by Kudos, they\xe2\x80\x99re not intended to be a replica. I took some liberties: Instead of a granola bar, I make my version with a simple shortbread crust that\xe2\x80\x99s pressed into the pan with your fingertips; it\xe2\x80\x99s sturdy enough to give the bar structure, but with a tender crumb and an irresistible brown butter flavor. I top the crust with a second layer made from a combination of melted natural peanut butter and milk chocolate into which I stir puffed rice (or, if you prefer, Rice Krispies).\n\nI prefer natural smooth peanut butter for almost everything, these bars included \xe2\x80\x94 the milk chocolate gives the mixture plenty of sweetness, and I like its slightly coarse texture; if you want even more texture, use crunchy peanut butter. Almond butter can also be substituted. The bars are finished with a silky layer of dark chocolate, its bitterness acting as a foil for the sweet peanut butter layer. A dusting of finely chopped peanuts adds another textural element.\n\nI cut the bars into squat, skinny bars. While small, they are mighty, rich and intense.

"2.txt";"b'But what effect does eating chocolate have on our health?\n\nChocolate has since become a popular food product that millions enjoy every day, thanks to its unique, rich, and sweet taste.\n\nAfter the European discovery of the Americas, chocolate became very popular in the wider world, and its demand exploded.\n\nChocolate is made from tropical Theobroma cacao tree seeds. Its earliest use dates back to the Olmec civilization in Mesoamerica.\n\nThe next time you eat a piece of chocolate, you may not have to feel so guilty about it. Despite its bad reputation for causing weight gain, a number of health benefits may be associated with this delicious treat.\n\nShare on Pinterest Recent research suggests that chocolate may have some health benefits.\n\nChocolate receives a lot of bad press because of its high fat and sugar content. Its consumption has been associated with acne, obesity, high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, and diabetes.\n\nHowever, according to a review of chocolate\xe2\x80\x99s health effects published in the Netherlands Journal of Medicine, it\xe2\x80\x99s not all bad news.\n\nThe authors point to the discovery that cocoa, the key ingredient in chocolate, contains biologically active phenolic compounds.\n\nThis has changed people\xe2\x80\x99s views on chocolate, and it has stimulated research into how it might impact aging, and conditions such as oxidative stress, blood pressure regulation, and atherosclerosis.\n\nChocolate\xe2\x80\x99s antioxidant potential may have a range of health benefits. The higher the cocoa content, as in dark chocolate, the more benefits there are. Dark chocolate may also contain less fat and sugar, but it is important to check the label.\n\nEating chocolate may have the following benefits:\n\nlowering cholesterol levels\n\npreventing cognitive decline\n\nreducing the risk of cardiovascular problems\n\nIt is important to note that the possible health benefits mentioned below came from single studies. More research is needed to confirm that eating chocolate can really improve people\xe2\x80\x99s health.\n\nIn addition, chocolate bars do not contain only cocoa. The benefits and risks of any other ingredients, such as sugar and fat, need to be considered.\n\n1) Cholesterol\n\nOne study, published in The Journal of Nutrition, suggests that chocolate consumption might help reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, also known as \xe2\x80\x9cbad cholesterol.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe researchers set out to investigate whether chocolate bars containing plant sterols (PS) and cocoa flavanols (CF) have any effect on cholesterol levels.\n\nThe authors concluded: \xe2\x80\x9cRegular consumption of chocolate bars containing PS and CF, as part of a low-fat diet, may support cardiovascular health by lowering cholesterol and improving blood pressure.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n2) Cognitive function\n\nScientists at Harvard Medical School have suggested that drinking two cups of hot chocolate a day could help keep the brain healthy and reduce memory decline in older people.\n\nThe researchers found that hot chocolate helped improve blood flow to parts of the brain where it was needed.\n\nLead author, Farzaneh A. Sorond, said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs different areas of the brain need more energy to complete their tasks, they also need greater blood flow. This relationship, called neurovascular coupling, may play an important role in diseases such as Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nResults of a lab experiment, published in 2014, indicated that a cocoa extract, called lavado, might reduce or prevent damage to nerve pathways found in patients with Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s disease. This extract could help slow symptoms such as cognitive decline.\n\nAnother study, published in 2016 in the journal Appetite, suggests eating chocolate at least once weekly could improve cognitive function.\n\n3) Heart disease\n\nResearch published in The BMJ, suggests that consuming chocolate could help lower the risk of developing heart disease by one-third .\n\nBased on their observations, the authors concluded that higher levels of chocolate consumption could be linked to a lower risk of cardiometabolic disorders.\n\nThey call for further experimental studies to confirm whether consuming chocolate is beneficial.\n\n4) Stroke\n\nCanadian scientists, in a study involving 44,489 individuals, found that people who ate one serving of chocolate were 22 percent less likely to experience a stroke than those who did not. Also, those who had about two ounces of chocolate a week were 46 percent less likely to die from a stroke.\n\nA further study, published in the journal Heart in 2015, tracked the impact of diet on the long-term health of 25,000 men and women.\n\nThe findings suggested that eating up to 100 grams (g) of chocolate each day may be linked to a lower risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\n5) Fetal growth and development\n\nEating 30 g (about one ounce) of chocolate every day during pregnancy might benefit fetal growth and development, according to a study presented at the 2016 Pregnancy Meeting of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine in Atlanta, GA.\n\n6) Athletic performance\n\nShare on Pinterest Chocolate may help athletes cover more distance while using less oxygen.\n\nFindings published in The Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition suggest that a little dark chocolate might boost oxygen availability during fitness training.\n\nResearchers who studied cyclists doing time trials in the United Kingdom found that \xe2\x80\x9cAfter eating dark chocolate, the riders used less oxygen when cycling at a moderate pace and also covered more distance in a two-minute flat-out time trial.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe scientists believe that the success of dark chocolate in this case is that it contains flavonols known as epicatechins, which enhance the release of nitric oxide in the body. Beetroot juice has a similar effect.'";"Other";"2.txt-Other"
"200.txt";"b'Food produced from the seed of Theobroma cacao\n\nChocolate is a food product made from roasted and ground cacao pods, that is available as a liquid, solid or paste, on its own or as a flavoring agent in other foods. Cacao has been consumed in some form since at least the Olmec civilization (19th-11th century BCE),[1][2] and the majority of Mesoamerican people - including the Maya and Aztecs - made chocolate beverages.[3]\n\nThe seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor. After fermentation, the beans are dried, cleaned, and roasted. The shell is removed to produce cocoa nibs, which are then ground to cocoa mass, unadulterated chocolate in rough form. Once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating, it is called chocolate liquor. The liquor may also be cooled and processed into its two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter. Baking chocolate, also called bitter chocolate, contains cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions, without any added sugar. Powdered baking cocoa, which contains more fiber than cocoa butter, can be processed with alkali to produce dutch cocoa. Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, a combination of cocoa solids, cocoa butter or added vegetable oils, and sugar. Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder or condensed milk. White chocolate contains cocoa butter, sugar, and milk, but no cocoa solids.\n\nChocolate is one of the most popular food types and flavors in the world, and many foodstuffs involving chocolate exist, particularly desserts, including cakes, pudding, mousse, chocolate brownies, and chocolate chip cookies. Many candies are filled with or coated with sweetened chocolate. Chocolate bars, either made of solid chocolate or other ingredients coated in chocolate, are eaten as snacks. Gifts of chocolate molded into different shapes (such as eggs, hearts, coins) are traditional on certain Western holidays, including Christmas, Easter, Valentine\'s Day, and Hanukkah. Chocolate is also used in cold and hot beverages, such as chocolate milk and hot chocolate, and in some alcoholic drinks, such as creme de cacao.\n\nAlthough cocoa originated in the Americas, West African countries, particularly C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire and Ghana, are the leading producers of cocoa in the 21st century, accounting for some 60% of the world cocoa supply.\n\nWith some two million children involved in the farming of cocoa in West Africa, child slavery and trafficking were major concerns in 2018,[4][5] and continue to be. International attempts to improve conditions for children were doomed to failure because of persistent poverty, absence of schools, increasing world cocoa demand, more intensive farming of cocoa, and continued exploitation of child labor.[4]\n\nHistory\n\nMesoamerican usage\n\nTwo Mayans sit around a container of frothed chocolate.\n\nChocolate has been prepared as a drink for nearly all of its history. For example, one vessel found at an Olmec archaeological site on the Gulf Coast of Veracruz, Mexico, dates chocolate\'s preparation by pre-Olmec peoples as early as 1750 BC.[6] On the Pacific coast of Chiapas, Mexico, a Mokaya archaeological site provides evidence of cocoa beverages dating even earlier, to 1900 BC.[7][6] The residues and the kind of vessel in which they were found indicate the initial use of cocoa was not simply as a beverage, but the white pulp around the cocoa beans was likely used as a source of fermentable sugars for an alcoholic drink.[8]\n\nMan Carrying a Cacao Pod, 1440\xe2\x80\x931521. Volcanic stone, traces of red pigment. Aztec., 1440\xe2\x80\x931521. Volcanic stone, traces of red pigment. Brooklyn Museum\n\nAn early Classic-period (460\xe2\x80\x93480 AD) Mayan tomb from the site in Rio Azul had vessels with the Maya glyph for cocoa on them with residue of a chocolate drink, suggests the Maya were drinking chocolate around 400 AD.[9] Documents in Maya hieroglyphs stated chocolate was used for ceremonial purposes, in addition to everyday life.[10] The Maya grew cacao trees in their backyards,[11] and used the cocoa seeds the trees produced to make a frothy, bitter drink.[12]\n\nBy the 15th century, the Aztecs gained control of a large part of Mesoamerica and adopted cocoa into their culture. They associated chocolate with Quetzalcoatl, who, according to one legend, was cast away by the other gods for sharing chocolate with humans,[13] and identified its extrication from the pod with the removal of the human heart in sacrifice.[14] In contrast to the Maya, who liked their chocolate warm, the Aztecs drank it cold, seasoning it with a broad variety of additives, including the petals of the Cymbopetalum penduliflorum tree, chile pepper, allspice, vanilla, and honey.\n\nThe Aztecs were unable to grow cocoa themselves, as their home in the Mexican highlands was unsuitable for it, so chocolate was a luxury imported into the empire.[13] Those who lived in areas ruled by the Aztecs were required to offer cocoa seeds in payment of the tax they deemed ""tribute"".[13] Cocoa beans were often used as currency.[15] For example, the Aztecs used a system in which one turkey cost 100 cocoa beans and one fresh avocado was worth three beans.[16]\n\nThe Maya and Aztecs associated cocoa with human sacrifice, and chocolate drinks specifically with sacrificial human blood. The Spanish royal chronicler Gonzalo Fern\xc3\xa1ndez de Oviedo y Vald\xc3\xa9s described a chocolate drink he had seen in Nicaragua in 1528, mixed with achiote: ""because those people are fond of drinking human blood, to make this beverage seem like blood, they add a little achiote, so that it then turns red. ... and part of that foam is left on the lips and around the mouth, and when it is red for having achiote, it seems a horrific thing, because it seems like blood itself.""\n\nEuropean adaptation\n\nThe morning chocolate by Chocolate soon became a fashionable drink of the European nobility after the discovery of the Americas.by Pietro Longhi ; Venice, 1775\xe2\x80\x931780\n\nUntil the 16th century, no European had ever heard of the popular drink from the Central American peoples.[13] Christopher Columbus and his son Ferdinand encountered the cocoa bean on Columbus\'s fourth mission to the Americas on 15 August 1502, when he and his crew seized a large native canoe that proved to contain cocoa beans among other goods for trade.[19] Spanish conquistador Hern\xc3\xa1n Cort\xc3\xa9s may have been the first European to encounter it, as the frothy drink was part of the after-dinner routine of Montezuma.[9][20] Jos\xc3\xa9 de Acosta, a Spanish Jesuit missionary who lived in Peru and then Mexico in the later 16th century, wrote of its growing influence on the Spaniards:\n\nAlthough bananas are more profitable, cocoa is more highly esteemed in Mexico. . . Cocoa is a smaller fruit than almonds and thicker, which toasted do not taste bad. It is so prized among the Indians and even among Spaniards. . . because since it is a dried fruit it can be stored for a long time without deterioration, and they brings ships loaded with them from the province of Guatemala. . . It also serves as currency, because with five cocoas you can buy one thing, with thirty another, and with a hundred something else, without there being contradiction; and they give these cocoas as alms to the poor who beg for them. The principal product of this cocoa is a concoction which they make that they call \xe2\x80\x9cchocolate,\xe2\x80\x9d which is a crazy thing treasured in that land, and those who are not accustomed are disgusted by it, because it has a foam on top and a bubbling like that of feces, which certainly takes a lot to put up with. Anyway, it is the prized beverage which the Indians offer to nobles who come to or pass through their lands; and the Spaniards, especially Spanish women born in those lands die for black chocolate. This aforementioned chocolate is said to the be made in various forms and temperaments, hot, cold, and lukewarm. They are wont to use spices and much chili; they also make it into a paste, and it is said that it is a medicine to treat coughs, the stomach, and colds. Whatever may be the case, in fact those who have not been reared on this opinion are not appetized by it.[21]\n\n""Trait\xc3\xa9s nouveaux & curieux du caf\xc3\xa9 du th\xc3\xa9 et du chocolate"", by Philippe Sylvestre Dufour, 1685 , by Philippe Sylvestre Dufour, 1685\n\nWhile Columbus had taken cocoa beans with him back to Spain,[19] chocolate made no impact until Spanish friars introduced it to the Spanish court.[13] After the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs, chocolate was imported to Europe. There, it quickly became a court favorite. It was still served as a beverage, but the Spanish added sugar, as well as honey (the original sweetener used by the Aztecs for chocolate), to counteract the natural bitterness.[22] Vanilla, another indigenous American introduction, was also a popular additive, with pepper and other spices sometimes used to give the illusion of a more potent vanilla flavor. Unfortunately, these spices tended to unsettle the European constitution; the Encyclop\xc3\xa9die states, ""The pleasant scent and sublime taste it imparts to chocolate have made it highly recommended; but a long experience having shown that it could potentially upset one\'s stomach"", which is why chocolate without vanilla was sometimes referred to as ""healthy chocolate"".[23] By 1602, chocolate had made its way from Spain to Austria.[24] By 1662, Pope Alexander VII had declared that religious fasts were not broken by consuming chocolate drinks. Within about a hundred years, chocolate established a foothold throughout Europe.[13]\n\nmoulinet or swizzle stick, London 1714\xe2\x80\x9315 ( Silver chocolate pot with hinged finial to insert aor swizzle stick, London 1714\xe2\x80\x9315 ( Victoria and Albert Museum\n\nThe new craze for chocolate brought with it a thriving slave market, as between the early 1600s and late 1800s, the laborious and slow processing of the cocoa bean was manual.[13] Cocoa plantations spread, as the English, Dutch, and French colonized and planted. With the depletion of Mesoamerican workers, largely to disease, cocoa production was often the work of poor wage laborers and African slaves. Wind-powered and horse-drawn mills were used to speed production, augmenting human labor. Heating the working areas of the table-mill, an innovation that emerged in France in 1732, also assisted in extraction.[25]\n\nNew processes that sped the production of chocolate emerged early in the Industrial Revolution. In 1815, Dutch chemist Coenraad van Houten introduced alkaline salts to chocolate, which reduced its bitterness.[13] A few years thereafter, in 1828, he created a press to remove about half the natural fat (cocoa butter or cocoa butter) from chocolate liquor, which made chocolate both cheaper to produce and more consistent in quality. This innovation introduced the modern era of chocolate.[19]\n\nKnown as ""Dutch cocoa"", this machine-pressed chocolate was instrumental in the transformation of chocolate to its solid form when, in 1847, English chocolatier Joseph Fry discovered a way to make chocolate moldable when he mixed the ingredients of cocoa powder and sugar with melted cocoa butter.[22] Subsequently, his chocolate factory, Fry\'s of Bristol, England, began mass-producing chocolate bars, Fry\'s Chocolate Cream, launched in 1866, and they became very popular.[26] Milk had sometimes been used as an addition to chocolate beverages since the mid-17th century, but in 1875 Swiss chocolatier Daniel Peter invented milk chocolate by mixing a powdered milk developed by Henri Nestl\xc3\xa9 with the liquor.[13][19] In 1879, the texture and taste of chocolate was further improved when Rudolphe Lindt invented the conching machine.[27]\n\nBesides Nestl\xc3\xa9, several notable chocolate companies had their start in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Rowntree\'s of York set up and began producing chocolate in 1862, after buying out the Tuke family business. Cadbury was manufacturing boxed chocolates in England by 1868.[13] Manufacturing their first Easter egg in 1875, Cadbury created the modern chocolate Easter egg after developing a pure cocoa butter that could easily be molded into smooth shapes.[28] In 1893, Milton S. Hershey purchased chocolate processing equipment at the World\'s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, and soon began the career of Hershey\'s chocolates with chocolate-coated caramels.\n\nIntroduction to the United States\n\nThe Baker Chocolate Company, which makes Baker\'s Chocolate, is the oldest producer of chocolate in the United States. In 1765 Dr. James Baker and John Hannon founded the company in Boston. Using cocoa beans from the West Indies, the pair built their chocolate business, which is still in operation.[29][30]\n\nWhite chocolate was first introduced to the U.S. in 1946 by Frederick E. Hebert of Hebert Candies in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, near Boston, after he had tasted ""white coat"" candies while traveling in Europe.[31][30]\n\nEtymology\n\nCocoa, pronounced by the Olmecs as kakawa,[1] dates to 1000 BC or earlier.[1] The word ""chocolate"" entered the English language from Spanish in about 1600.[32] The word entered Spanish from the word chocol\xc4\x81tl in Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs. The origin of the Nahuatl word is uncertain, as it does not appear in any early Nahuatl source, where the word for chocolate drink is cacahuatl, ""cocoa water"". It is possible that the Spaniards coined the word (perhaps in order to avoid caca, a vulgar Spanish word for ""faeces"") by combining the Yucatec Mayan word chocol, ""hot"", with the Nahuatl word atl, ""water"". A widely-cited proposal is that the derives from unattested xocolatl meaning ""bitter drink"" is unsupported; the change from x- to ch- is unexplained, as is the -l-. Another proposed etymology derives it from the word chicolatl, meaning ""beaten drink"", which may derive from the word for the frothing stick, chicoli.[34] Other scholars reject all these proposals, considering the origin of first element of the name to be unknown.[35] The term ""chocolatier"", for a chocolate confection maker, is attested from 1888.[36]\n\nTypes\n\nChocolate is commonly used as a coating for various fruits such as cherries and/or fillings, such as liqueurs\n\nSeveral types of chocolate can be distinguished. Pure, unsweetened chocolate, often called ""baking chocolate"", contains primarily cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions. Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, which combines chocolate with sugar.\n\nMilk\n\nMilk chocolate is sweet chocolate that also contains milk powder or condensed milk. In the UK and Ireland, milk chocolate must contain a minimum of 20% total dry cocoa solids; in the rest of the European Union, the minimum is 25%.[37]\n\nWhite\n\nWhite chocolate\n\nWhite chocolate, although similar in texture to that of milk and dark chocolate, does not contain any cocoa solids that impart a dark color. In 2002, the US Food and Drug Administration established a standard for white chocolate as the ""common or usual name of products made from cocoa fat (i.e., cocoa butter), milk solids, nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners, and other safe and suitable ingredients, but containing no nonfat cocoa solids"".[38]\n\nDark\n\nDark chocolate is produced by adding fat and sugar to the cocoa mixture. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration calls this ""sweet chocolate"", and requires a 15% concentration of chocolate liquor. European rules specify a minimum of 35% cocoa solids.[37] A higher amount of cocoa solids indicates more bitterness. Semisweet chocolate is dark chocolate with low sugar content. Bittersweet chocolate is chocolate liquor to which some sugar (typically a third), more cocoa butter and vanilla are added.[39] It has less sugar and more liquor than semisweet chocolate, but the two are interchangeable in baking. It is also known to last for two years if stored properly. As of 2017 , there is no high-quality evidence that dark chocolate affects blood pressure significantly or provides other health benefits.[40]\n\nUnsweetened\n\nUnsweetened chocolate is pure chocolate liquor, also known as bitter or baking chocolate. It is unadulterated chocolate: the pure, ground, roasted chocolate beans impart a strong, deep chocolate flavor. It is typically used in baking or other products to which sugar and other ingredients are added. Raw chocolate, often referred to as raw cocoa, is always dark and a minimum of 75% cocoa.\n\nUnsweetened ""Baking"" Chocolate\n\nPoorly tempered or untempered chocolate may have whitish spots on the dark chocolate part, called chocolate bloom; it is an indication that sugar or fat has separated due to poor storage. It is not toxic and can be safely consumed.[41]\n\nProduction\n\nChocolate is created from the cocoa bean. A cacao tree with fruit pods in various stages of ripening.\n\nRoughly two-thirds of the entire world\'s cocoa is produced in West Africa, with 43% sourced from C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire,[42] where, as of 2007 , child labor is a common practice to obtain the product.[43][44] According to the World Cocoa Foundation, in 2007 some 50 million people around the world depended on cocoa as a source of livelihood.[45] As of 2007 in the UK, most chocolatiers purchase their chocolate from them, to melt, mold and package to their own design.[46] According to the WCF\'s 2012 report, the Ivory Coast is the largest producer of cocoa in the world.[47] The two main jobs associated with creating chocolate candy are chocolate makers and chocolatiers. Chocolate makers use harvested cocoa beans and other ingredients to produce couverture chocolate (covering). Chocolatiers use the finished couverture to make chocolate candies (bars, truffles, etc.).[48]\n\nProduction costs can be decreased by reducing cocoa solids content or by substituting cocoa butter with another fat. Cocoa growers object to allowing the resulting food to be called ""chocolate"", due to the risk of lower demand for their crops.[45]\n\nGenome\n\nThe sequencing in 2010 of the genome of the cacao tree may allow yields to be improved.[49] Due to concerns about global warming effects on lowland climate in the narrow band of latitudes where cocoa is grown (20 degrees north and south of the equator), the commercial company Mars, Incorporated and the University of California, Berkeley are conducting genomic research in 2017\xe2\x80\x9318 to improve the survivability of cacao plants in hot climates.[50]\n\nCacao varieties\n\nChocolate is made from cocoa beans, the dried and fermented seeds of the cacao tree (Theobroma cacao), a small, 4\xe2\x80\x938 m tall (15\xe2\x80\x9326 ft tall) evergreen tree native to the deep tropical region of the Americas. Recent genetic studies suggest the most common genotype of the plant originated in the Amazon basin and was gradually transported by humans throughout South and Central America. Early forms of another genotype have also been found in what is now Venezuela. The scientific name, Theobroma, means ""food of the gods"".[51] The fruit, called a cocoa pod, is ovoid, 15\xe2\x80\x9330 cm (6\xe2\x80\x9312 in) long and 8\xe2\x80\x9310 cm (3\xe2\x80\x934 in) wide, ripening yellow to orange, and weighing about 500 g (1.1 lb) when ripe.\n\nCacao trees are small, understory trees that need rich, well-drained soils. They naturally grow within 20\xc2\xb0 of either side of the equator because they need about 2000 mm of rainfall a year, and temperatures in the range of 21 to 32 \xc2\xb0C (70 to 90 \xc2\xb0F). Cacao trees cannot tolerate a temperature lower than 15 \xc2\xb0C (59 \xc2\xb0F).[52]\n\nThe three main varieties of cocoa beans used in chocolate are criollo, forastero, and trinitario.\n\nCriollo\n\nRepresenting only 5% of all cocoa beans grown as of 2008 ,[53] criollo is the rarest and most expensive cocoa on the market, and is native to Central America, the Caribbean islands and the northern tier of South American states.[54] The genetic purity of cocoas sold today as criollo is disputed, as most populations have been exposed to the genetic influence of other varieties.\n\nCriollos are particularly difficult to grow, as they are vulnerable to a variety of environmental threats and produce low yields of cocoa per tree. The flavor of criollo is described as delicate yet complex, low in classic chocolate flavor, but rich in ""secondary"" notes of long duration.[55]\n\nForastero\n\nThe most commonly grown bean is forastero,[53] a large group of wild and cultivated cocoas, most likely native to the Amazon basin. The African cocoa crop is entirely made up of forastero. They are significantly hardier and of higher yield than criollo. The source of most chocolate marketed,[53] forastero cocoas are typically strong in classic ""chocolate"" flavor, but have a short duration and are unsupported by secondary flavors, producing ""quite bland"" chocolate.[53]\n\nTrinitario\n\nTrinitario is a natural hybrid of criollo and forastero. Trinitario originated in Trinidad after an introduction of forastero to the local criollo crop. Nearly all cocoa produced over the past five decades is of the forastero or lower-grade trinitario varieties.[56]\n\nProcessing\n\nCocoa pods are harvested by cutting them from the tree using a machete, or by knocking them off the tree using a stick. The beans with their surrounding pulp are removed from the pods and placed in piles or bins, allowing access to micro-organisms so fermentation of the pectin-containing material can begin. Yeasts produce ethanol, lactic acid bacteria produce lactic acid, and acetic acid bacteria produce acetic acid. The fermentation process, which takes up to seven days, also produces several flavor precursors, eventually resulting in the familiar chocolate taste.[57]\n\nIt is important to harvest the pods when they are fully ripe, because if the pod is unripe, the beans will have a low cocoa butter content, or sugars in the white pulp will be insufficient for fermentation, resulting in a weak flavor. After fermentation, the beans must be quickly dried to prevent mold growth. Climate and weather permitting, this is done by spreading the beans out in the sun from five to seven days.[58]\n\nThe dried beans are then transported to a chocolate manufacturing facility. The beans are cleaned (removing twigs, stones, and other debris), roasted, and graded. Next, the shell of each bean is removed to extract the nib. Finally, the nibs are ground and liquefied, resulting in pure chocolate in fluid form: chocolate liquor.[59] The liquor can be further processed into two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter.[60]\n\nBlending\n\nChocolate liquor is blended with the cocoa butter in varying quantities to make different types of chocolate or couverture. The basic blends of ingredients for the various types of chocolate (in order of highest quantity of cocoa liquor first), are:\n\nFountain chocolate is made with high levels of cocoa butter, allowing it to flow gently over a chocolate fountain to serve as dessert fondue\n\nDark chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa liquor, and (sometimes) vanilla\n\nMilk chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa liquor, milk or milk powder, and vanilla\n\nWhite chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, milk or milk powder, and vanilla\n\nUsually, an emulsifying agent, such as soy lecithin, is added, though a few manufacturers prefer to exclude this ingredient for purity reasons and to remain GMO-free, sometimes at the cost of a perfectly smooth texture. Some manufacturers are now using PGPR, an artificial emulsifier derived from castor oil that allows them to reduce the amount of cocoa butter while maintaining the same mouthfeel.\n\nThe texture is also heavily influenced by processing, specifically conching (see below). The more expensive chocolate tends to be processed longer and thus has a smoother texture and mouthfeel, regardless of whether emulsifying agents are added.\n\nDifferent manufacturers develop their own ""signature"" blends based on the above formulas, but varying proportions of the different constituents are used. The finest, plain dark chocolate couverture contains at least 70% cocoa (both solids and butter), whereas milk chocolate usually contains up to 50%. High-quality white chocolate couverture contains only about 35% cocoa butter.\n\nProducers of high-quality, small-batch chocolate argue that mass production produces bad-quality chocolate.[53] Some mass-produced chocolate contains much less cocoa (as low as 7% in many cases), and fats other than cocoa butter. Vegetable oils and artificial vanilla flavor are often used in cheaper chocolate to mask poorly fermented and/or roasted beans.[53]\n\nIn 2007, the Chocolate Manufacturers Association in the United States, whose members include Hershey, Nestl\xc3\xa9, and Archer Daniels Midland, lobbied the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to change the legal definition of chocolate to let them substitute partially hydrogenated vegetable oils for cocoa butter, in addition to using artificial sweeteners and milk substitutes.[61] Currently, the FDA does not allow a product to be referred to as ""chocolate"" if the product contains any of these ingredients.[62][63]\n\nIn the EU a product can be sold as chocolate if it contains up to 5% vegetable oil, and must be labeled as ""family milk chocolate"" rather than ""milk chocolate"" if it contains 20% milk.[64]\n\nAccording to Canadian Food and Drug Regulations,[65] a ""chocolate product"" is a food product that is sourced from at least one ""cocoa product"" and contains at least one of the following: ""chocolate, bittersweet chocolate, semi-sweet chocolate, dark chocolate, sweet chocolate, milk chocolate, or white chocolate"". A ""cocoa product"" is defined as a food product that is sourced from cocoa beans and contains ""cocoa nibs, cocoa liquor, cocoa mass, unsweetened chocolate, bitter chocolate, chocolate liquor, cocoa, low-fat cocoa, cocoa powder, or low-fat cocoa powder"".\n\nConching\n\nChocolate melanger mixing raw ingredients\n\nThe penultimate process is called conching. A conche is a container filled with metal beads, which act as grinders. The refined and blended chocolate mass is kept in a liquid state by frictional heat. Chocolate before conching has an uneven and gritty texture. The conching process produces cocoa and sugar particles smaller than the tongue can detect (typically around 20 \xce\xbcm) and reduces rough edges, hence the smooth feel in the mouth. The length of the conching process determines the final smoothness and quality of the chocolate. High-quality chocolate is conched for about 72 hours, and lesser grades about four to six hours. After the process is complete, the chocolate mass is stored in tanks heated to about 45 to 50 \xc2\xb0C (113 to 122 \xc2\xb0F) until final processing.[66]\n\nTempering\n\nVideo of cocoa beans being ground and mixed with other ingredients to make chocolate at a Mayordomo store in Oaxaca\n\nThe final process is called tempering. Uncontrolled crystallization of cocoa butter typically results in crystals of varying size, some or all large enough to be seen with the naked eye. This causes the surface of the chocolate to appear mottled and matte, and causes the chocolate to crumble rather than snap when broken.[67][68] The uniform sheen and crisp bite of properly processed chocolate are the results of consistently small cocoa butter crystals produced by the tempering process.\n\nThe fats in cocoa butter can crystallize in six different forms (polymorphous crystallization).[67][69] The primary purpose of tempering is to assure that only the best form is present. The six different crystal forms have different properties.\n\nCrystal Melting temp. Notes I 17 \xc2\xb0C (63 \xc2\xb0F) Soft, crumbly, melts too easily II 21 \xc2\xb0C (70 \xc2\xb0F) Soft, crumbly, melts too easily III 26 \xc2\xb0C (79 \xc2\xb0F) Firm, poor snap, melts too easily IV 28 \xc2\xb0C (82 \xc2\xb0F) Firm, good snap, melts too easily V 34 \xc2\xb0C (93 \xc2\xb0F) Glossy, firm, best snap, melts near body temperature (37 \xc2\xb0C) VI 36 \xc2\xb0C (97 \xc2\xb0F) Hard, takes weeks to form\n\nMolten chocolate and a piece of a chocolate bar\n\nAs a solid piece of chocolate, the cocoa butter fat particles are in a crystalline rigid structure that gives the chocolate its solid appearance. Once heated, the crystals of the polymorphic cocoa butter can break apart from the rigid structure and allow the chocolate to obtain a more fluid consistency as the temperature increases \xe2\x80\x93 the melting process. When the heat is removed, the cocoa butter crystals become rigid again and come closer together, allowing the chocolate to solidify.[70]\n\nThe temperature in which the crystals obtain enough energy to break apart from their rigid conformation would depend on the milk fat content in the chocolate and the shape of the fat molecules, as well as the form of the cocoa butterfat. Chocolate with a higher fat content will melt at a lower temperature.[71]\n\nMaking chocolate considered ""good"" is about forming as many type V crystals as possible. This provides the best appearance and texture and creates the most stable crystals, so the texture and appearance will not degrade over time. To accomplish this, the temperature is carefully manipulated during the crystallization.\n\npistoles and callets Chocolate cubes,and\n\nGenerally, the chocolate is first heated to 45 \xc2\xb0C (113 \xc2\xb0F) to melt all six forms of crystals.[67][69] Next, the chocolate is cooled to about 27 \xc2\xb0C (81 \xc2\xb0F), which will allow crystal types IV and V to form. At this temperature, the chocolate is agitated to create many small crystal ""seeds"" which will serve as nuclei to create small crystals in the chocolate. The chocolate is then heated to about 31 \xc2\xb0C (88 \xc2\xb0F) to eliminate any type IV crystals, leaving just type V. After this point, any excessive heating of the chocolate will destroy the temper and this process will have to be repeated. Other methods of chocolate tempering are used as well. The most common variant is introducing already tempered, solid ""seed"" chocolate. The temper of chocolate can be measured with a chocolate temper meter to ensure accuracy and consistency. A sample cup is filled with the chocolate and placed in the unit which then displays or prints the results.\n\nTwo classic ways of manually tempering chocolate are:\n\nWorking the molten chocolate on a heat-absorbing surface, such as a stone slab, until thickening indicates the presence of sufficient crystal ""seeds""; the chocolate is then gently warmed to working temperature.\n\nStirring solid chocolate into molten chocolate to ""inoculate"" the liquid chocolate with crystals (this method uses the already formed crystals of the solid chocolate to ""seed"" the molten chocolate).\n\nChocolate tempering machines (or temperers) with computer controls can be used for producing consistently tempered chocolate. In particular, continuous tempering machines are used in large volume applications. Various methods and apparatuses for continuous flow tempering have been described by Aasted, Sollich and Buhler, three manufacturers of commercial chocolate equipment, with a focus now on energy efficiency. In general, molten chocolate coming in at 40\xe2\x80\x9350 \xc2\xb0C is cooled in heat exchangers to crystallization temperates of about 26\xe2\x80\x9330 \xc2\xb0C, passed through a tempering column consisting of spinning plates to induce shear, then warmed slightly to re-melt undesirable crystal formations.[72][73]\n\nShaping\n\nChocolate is molded in different shapes for different uses:[74]\n\nChocolate bars (tablets) are rectangular blocks of chocolate meant to be broken down to cubes (or other predefined shapes), which can then be used for consumption, cooking and baking. The term is also used for combination bars, which are a type of candy bars\n\nChocolate chips are small pieces of chocolate, usually drop-like, which are meant for decoration and baking\n\nPistoles , callets and f\xc3\xa8ves are small, coin-like or bean-like pieces of chocolate meant for baking and patisserie applications (also see Pistole (coin) and F\xc3\xa8ve (trinket))\n\n, and are small, coin-like or bean-like pieces of chocolate meant for baking and patisserie applications (also see Pistole (coin) and F\xc3\xa8ve (trinket)) Chocolate blocks are large, cuboid chunks of chocolate meant for professional use and further processing\n\nOther, more specialized shapes for chocolate include sticks, curls and hollow semi-spheres\n\nStorage\n\nChocolate is very sensitive to temperature and humidity. Ideal storage temperatures are between 15 and 17 \xc2\xb0C (59 and 63 \xc2\xb0F), with a relative humidity of less than 50%. If refrigerated or frozen without containment, chocolate can absorb enough moisture to cause a whitish discoloration, the result of fat or sugar crystals rising to the surface. Various types of ""blooming"" effects can occur if chocolate is stored or served improperly.[75]\n\nChocolate bloom is caused by storage temperature fluctuating or exceeding 24 \xc2\xb0C (75 \xc2\xb0F), while sugar bloom is caused by temperature below 15 \xc2\xb0C (59 \xc2\xb0F) or excess humidity. To distinguish between different types of bloom, one can rub the surface of the chocolate lightly, and if the bloom disappears, it is fat bloom. Moving chocolate between temperature extremes, can result in an oily texture. Although visually unappealing, chocolate suffering from bloom is safe for consumption and taste unaffected.[76][77][78] Bloom can be reversed by retempering the chocolate or using it for any use that requires melting the chocolate.[79]\n\nChocolate is generally stored away from other foods, as it can absorb different aromas. Ideally, chocolates are packed or wrapped, and placed in proper storage with the correct humidity and temperature. Additionally, chocolate is frequently stored in a dark place or protected from light by wrapping paper. The glossy shine, snap, aroma, texture, and taste of the chocolate can show the quality and if it was stored well.[80]\n\nComposition\n\nNutrition\n\nA 100-gram serving of milk chocolate supplies 540 calories. It is 59% carbohydrates (52% as sugar and 3% as dietary fiber), 30% fat and 8% protein (table). Approximately 65% of the fat in milk chocolate is saturated, mainly palmitic acid and stearic acid, while the predominant unsaturated fat is oleic acid (table).\n\n100-grams of milk chocolate is an excellent source (over 19% of the Daily Value, DV) of riboflavin, vitamin B12 and the dietary minerals, manganese, phosphorus and zinc. Chocolate is a good source (10\xe2\x80\x9319% DV) of calcium, magnesium and iron.\n\nEffects on health\n\nChocolate may be a factor for heartburn in some people because one of its constituents, theobromine, may affect the esophageal sphincter muscle in a way that permits stomach acids to enter the esophagus.[81] Theobromine poisoning is an overdosage reaction to the bitter alkaloid, which happens more frequently in domestic animals than humans. However, daily intake of 50\xe2\x80\x93100 g cocoa (0.8\xe2\x80\x931.5 g theobromine) by humans has been associated with sweating, trembling and severe headache.[82] Chocolate contains alkaloids such as theobromine and phenethylamine, which have physiological effects in humans, but the presence of theobromine renders it toxic to some animals, including dogs and cats.[83]\n\nAccording to a 2005 study, the average lead concentration of cocoa beans is \xe2\x89\xa4 0.5 ng/g, which is one of the lowest reported values for a natural food.[84] However, during cultivation and production, chocolate may absorb lead from the environment (such as in atmospheric emissions of leaded gasoline, which is still being used in Nigeria).[84] Reports from 2014 indicate that ""chocolate might be a significant source"" of lead ingestion for children if consumption is high (with dark chocolate containing higher amounts),[85][86] and ""one 10 g cube of dark chocolate may contain as much as 20% of the daily lead oral limit.""[85]\n\nChocolate and cocoa contain moderate to high amounts of oxalate,[87][88] which may increase the risk of kidney stones.[89]\n\nA few studies have documented allergic reactions from chocolate in children.[81] Other research has shown that dark chocolate can aggravate acne in men who are prone to it.[90] Research has also shown that consuming dark chocolate does not substantially affect blood pressure.[40] Chocolate and cocoa are under preliminary research to determine if consumption affects the risk of certain cardiovascular diseases[91] or cognitive abilities.[92]\n\nOne tablespoonful (5 grams) of dry unsweetened cocoa powder has 12.1 mg of caffeine[93] and a 25-g single serving of dark chocolate has 22.4 mg of caffeine.[94] Although a single 7 oz. serving of coffee may contain 80\xe2\x80\x93175 mg,[95] studies have shown psychoactive effects in caffeine doses as low as 9 mg,[96] and a dose as low as 12.5 mg was shown to have effects on cognitive performance.[97]\n\nExcessive consumption of large quantities of any energy-rich food, such as chocolate, without a corresponding increase in activity to expend the associated calories, can cause weight gain and possibly lead to obesity.[81] Raw chocolate is high in cocoa butter, a fat which is removed during chocolate refining and then added back in varying proportions during the manufacturing process. Manufacturers may add other fats, sugars, and milk, all of which increase the caloric content of chocolate.[81]\n\nPhytochemicals\n\nIn comparison to most foods, cocoa contains more phenolic antioxidants.[98] Cocoa solids are a source of flavonoids[99] and alkaloids, such as theobromine, phenethylamine, and caffeine.[100]\n\nLabeling\n\nSome manufacturers provide the percentage of chocolate in a finished chocolate confection as a label quoting percentage of ""cocoa"" or ""cacao"". This refers to the combined percentage of both cocoa solids and cocoa butter in the bar, not just the percentage of cocoa solids.[101] The Belgian AMBAO certification mark indicates that no non-cocoa vegetable fats have been used in making the chocolate.[102][103] A long-standing dispute between Britain on the one hand and Belgium and France over British use of vegetable fats in chocolate ended in 2000 with the adoption of new standards which permitted the use of up to five percent vegetable fats in clearly labelled products.[104] This British style of chocolate has sometimes been pejoratively referred to as ""vegelate"".[104]\n\nChocolates that are organic[105] or fair trade certified[106] carry labels accordingly.\n\nIn the United States, some large chocolate manufacturers lobbied the federal government to permit confections containing cheaper hydrogenated vegetable oil in place of cocoa butter to be sold as ""chocolate"". In June 2007, in response to consumer concern about the proposal, the FDA reiterated ""Cacao fat, as one of the signature characteristics of the product, will remain a principal component of standardized chocolate.""[107]\n\nIndustry\n\nChocolate, prevalent throughout the world, is a steadily growing, US$50 billion-a-year worldwide business.[108] Europe accounts for 45% of the world\'s chocolate revenue,[109] and the US spent $20 billion in 2013.[110] Big Chocolate is the grouping of major international chocolate companies in Europe and the U.S. U.S. companies Mars and Hershey\'s alone generated $13 billion a year in chocolate sales and account for two-thirds of U.S. production in 2004.[111] Despite the expanding reach of the chocolate industry internationally, cocoa farmers and labourers in the Ivory Coast are unaware of the uses of the beans; the high cost of chocolate products in the Ivory Coast make it inaccessible to the majority of the population, who do not know what it tastes like.[112]\n\nManufacturers\n\nChocolate with various fillings\n\nChocolate manufacturers produce a range of products from chocolate bars to fudge. Large manufacturers of chocolate products include Cadbury (the world\'s largest confectionery manufacturer), Ferrero, Guylian, The Hershey Company, Lindt & Spr\xc3\xbcngli, Mars, Incorporated, Milka, Neuhaus and Suchard.\n\nGuylian is best known for its chocolate sea shells; Cadbury for its Dairy Milk and Creme Egg. The Hershey Company, the largest chocolate manufacturer in North America, produces the Hershey Bar and Hershey\'s Kisses.[113] Mars Incorporated, a large privately owned U.S. corporation, produces Mars Bar, Milky Way, M&M\'s, Twix, and Snickers. Lindt is known for its truffle balls and gold foil-wrapped Easter bunnies.\n\nFood conglomerates Nestl\xc3\xa9 SA and Kraft Foods both have chocolate brands. Nestl\xc3\xa9 acquired Rowntree\'s in 1988 and now markets chocolates under their brand, including Smarties (a chocolate candy) and Kit Kat (a chocolate bar); Kraft Foods through its 1990 acquisition of Jacobs Suchard, now owns Milka and Suchard. In February 2010, Kraft also acquired British-based Cadbury;[114] Fry\'s, Trebor Basset and the fair trade brand Green & Black\'s also belongs to the group.\n\nChild labor in cocoa harvesting\n\nThe widespread use of children in cocoa production is controversial, not only for the concerns about child labor and exploitation, but also because up to 12,000 of the 200,000 children working in C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire, the world\'s biggest producer of cocoa,[115] may be victims of trafficking or slavery.[116] Most attention on this subject has focused on West Africa, which collectively supplies 69 percent of the world\'s cocoa, and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire in particular, which supplies 35 percent of the world\'s cocoa. Thirty percent of children under age 15 in sub-Saharan Africa are child laborers, mostly in agricultural activities including cocoa farming.[118] Major chocolate producers, such as Nestl\xc3\xa9, buy cocoa at commodities exchanges where Ivorian cocoa is mixed with other cocoa.[119]\n\nIn 2009, Salvation Army International Development (SAID) UK stated that 12,000 children have been trafficked on cocoa farms in the Ivory Coast of Africa, where half of the world\'s chocolate is made.[120] SAID UK states that it is these child slaves who are likely to be working in ""harsh and abusive""[121] conditions for the production of chocolate,[120] and an increasing number of health-food[122] and anti-slavery[123] organisations are highlighting and campaigning against the use of trafficking in the chocolate industry.\n\nAs of 2017, approximately 2.1 million children in Ghana and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire were involved in farming cocoa, carrying heavy loads, clearing forests, and being exposed to pesticides.[5] According to Sona Ebai, the former secretary-general of the Alliance of Cocoa Producing Countries: ""I think child labor cannot be just the responsibility of industry to solve. I think it\'s the proverbial all-hands-on-deck: government, civil society, the private sector. And there, you need leadership.""[116] Reported in 2018, a 3-year pilot program \xe2\x80\x93 conducted by Nestl\xc3\xa9 with 26,000 farmers mostly located in C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire \xe2\x80\x93 observed a 51% decrease in the number of children doing hazardous jobs in cocoa farming.[4] The US Department of Labor formed the Child Labor Cocoa Coordinating Group as a public-private partnership with the governments of Ghana and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire to address child labor practices in the cocoa industry.[124] The International Cocoa Initiative involving major cocoa manufacturers established the Child Labor Monitoring and Remediation System intended to monitor thousands of farms in Ghana and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire for child labor conditions,[4][5] but the program reached less than 20% of the child laborers.[125] Despite these efforts, goals to reduce child labor in West Africa by 70% before 2020 are frustrated by persistent poverty, absence of schools, expansion of cocoa farmland, and increased demand for cocoa.[4][126]\n\nIn April 2018, the Cocoa Barometer report stated: ""Not a single company or government is anywhere near reaching the sector-wide objective of the elimination of child labor, and not even near their commitments of a 70% reduction of child labor by 2020"".[126]\n\nFair trade\n\nIn the 2000s, some chocolate producers began to engage in fair trade initiatives, to address concerns about the marginalization of cocoa laborers in developing countries. Traditionally, Africa and other developing countries received low prices for their exported commodities such as cocoa, which caused poverty to abound. Fairtrade seeks to establish a system of direct trade from developing countries to counteract this unfair system.[127] One solution for fair labor practices is for farmers to become part of an Agricultural cooperative. Cooperatives pay farmers a fair price for their cocoa so farmers have enough money for food, clothes, and school fees.[128] One of the main tenets of fair trade is that farmers receive a fair price, but this does not mean that the larger amount of money paid for fair trade cocoa goes directly to the farmers. The effectiveness of fair trade has been questioned. In a 2014 article, The Economist stated that workers on fair trade farms have a lower standard of living than on similar farms outside the fair trade system.[129]\n\nUsage and consumption\n\ns\'more topped with melted chocolate from a chocolate bar\n\nChocolate cake with chocolate frosting\n\nBars\n\nChocolate is sold in chocolate bars, which come in dark chocolate, milk chocolate and white chocolate varieties. Some bars that are mostly chocolate have other ingredients blended into the chocolate, such as nuts, raisins, or crisped rice. Chocolate is used as an ingredient in a huge variety of bars, which typically contain various confectionary ingredients (e.g., nougat, wafers, caramel, nuts, etc.) which are coated in chocolate.\n\nCoating and filling\n\nChocolate is used as a flavouring product in many desserts, such as chocolate cakes, chocolate brownies, chocolate mousse and chocolate chip cookies. Numerous types of candy and snacks contain chocolate, either as a filling (e.g., M&M\'s) or as a coating (e.g., chocolate-coated raisins or chocolate-coated peanuts).\n\nBeverages\n\nSome non-alcoholic beverages contain chocolate, such as chocolate milk, hot chocolate, chocolate milkshakes and tejate. Some alcoholic liqueurs are flavoured with chocolate, such as chocolate liqueur and creme de cacao. Chocolate is a popular flavour of ice cream and pudding, and chocolate sauce is a commonly added as a topping on ice cream sundaes. The caff\xc3\xa8 mocha is an espresso beverage containing chocolate.\n\nSee also\n\nReferences'";"Other";"200.txt-Other"

Its earliest use dates back to the Olmec civilization in Mesoamerica.\n\nThe next time you eat a piece of chocolate, you may not have to feel so guilty about it. Despite its bad reputation for causing weight gain, a number of health benefits may be associated with this delicious treat.\n\nShare on Pinterest Recent research suggests that chocolate may have some health benefits.\n\nChocolate receives a lot of bad press because of its high fat and sugar content. Its consumption has been associated with acne, obesity, high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, and diabetes.\n\nHowever, according to a review of chocolate\xe2\x80\x99s health effects published in the Netherlands Journal of Medicine, it\xe2\x80\x99s not all bad news.\n\nThe authors point to the discovery that cocoa, the key ingredient in chocolate, contains biologically active phenolic compounds.\n\nThis has changed people\xe2\x80\x99s views on chocolate, and it has stimulated research into how it might impact aging, and conditions such as oxidative stress, blood pressure regulation, and atherosclerosis.\n\nChocolate\xe2\x80\x99s antioxidant potential may have a range of health benefits. The higher the cocoa content, as in dark chocolate, the more benefits there are. Dark chocolate may also contain less fat and sugar, but it is important to check the label.\n\nEating chocolate may have the following benefits:\n\nlowering cholesterol levels\n\npreventing cognitive decline\n\nreducing the risk of cardiovascular problems\n\nIt is important to note that the possible health benefits mentioned below came from single studies. More research is needed to confirm that eating chocolate can really improve people\xe2\x80\x99s health.\n\nIn addition, chocolate bars do not contain only cocoa. The benefits and risks of any other ingredients, such as sugar and fat, need to be considered.\n\n1) Cholesterol\n\nOne study, published in The Journal of Nutrition, suggests that chocolate consumption might help reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, also known as \xe2\x80\x9cbad cholesterol.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe researchers set out to investigate whether chocolate bars containing plant sterols (PS) and cocoa flavanols (CF) have any effect on cholesterol levels.\n\nThe authors concluded: \xe2\x80\x9cRegular consumption of chocolate bars containing PS and CF, as part of a low-fat diet, may support cardiovascular health by lowering cholesterol and improving blood pressure.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n2) Cognitive function\n\nScientists at Harvard Medical School have suggested that drinking two cups of hot chocolate a day could help keep the brain healthy and reduce memory decline in older people.\n\nThe researchers found that hot chocolate helped improve blood flow to parts of the brain where it was needed.\n\nLead author, Farzaneh A. Sorond, said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs different areas of the brain need more energy to complete their tasks, they also need greater blood flow.

"203.txt";"b'Chocolate is the most popular sweet treat in the world. People around the world (but mostly in Europe and the United States) consume more than 3 million tons of cocoa beans a year, according to the World Cocoa Foundation. And, not only does eating chocolate make you feel good, it may also be good for your heart and your brain.\n\nWhat is chocolate?\n\nChocolate is prepared from the fruit of the Theobroma cacao, a tropical tree whose name means ""food of the gods"" in Greek, according to ""Chocolate: Food of the Gods,"" an online exhibit by the Cornell University Library.\n\nTheobroma cacao trees are native to the Amazon and Orinoco river basins in South America. The trees are widely distributed from southeastern Mexico to the Amazon River. They thrive in hot, humid areas within about 20 degrees of the equator, according to Cornell. As the popularity of chocolate spread, growers established plantations in other regions, such as West Africa and South and Southeast Asia. Today, Ghana, C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire, Nigeria, Indonesia and Brazil account for 79 percent of the world\'s cacao production.\n\nCacao trees bear fruit that are about the same size and shape of a papaya, according to Patric Chocolate. These bumpy, lumpy berries, or pods, are full of up to 50 sour seeds, or beans, covered in white pulp.\n\nCacao seeds are harvested by hand because machines could injure the trees, according to Cornell. Workers remove the pods, which are orange when they are ripe, and open them with a machete. The seeds are placed in large fermentation trays that are stacked and covered in banana leaves, where they are left for two to seven days. Fermentation produces the chocolate flavor and aroma. It also destroys the seed\'s embryo, preventing unwanted germination, and causes the white pulp to fall away from the seeds.\n\nAfter fermenting, the beans dry out on sunny platforms. Workers turn them several times a day for three to five days to complete drying. The beans can dry faster in rotary driers but sun-dried beans taste the best, according to Cornell.\n\nNext, the beans are taken to the chocolate factory, where they are cleaned and debris is removed. The beans are roasted in large, rotating ovens. The roasting draws out flavor and removes the beans from their hulls. Roasted beans go into a winnowing machine, which cracks the beans and removes hulls. The remaining part of the bean is called the nib. Nibs become chocolate.\n\nThe nibs are ground down under a series of rollers. This process results in a thick paste called chocolate liquor. Chocolate liquor does not contain alcohol (however, chocolate liqueur does). It is the main source of unsweetened baking chocolate, according to Pam Williams, co-founder and past president of the Fine Chocolate Industry Association (FCIA) and founder and lead instructor of Ecole Cocolat Professional School of Chocolate Arts.\n\nAt this stage, the type of chocolate being produced is determined. According to the FCIA, ingredients separate fine chocolate from that of average quality. ""Fine chocolate,"" as designated by the FCIA, contains only cacao liquor, cacao butter (optional), sugar, lecithin, vanilla (optional) and possibly milk fats and solids. Additional flavors or ingredients like nuts can be added later.\n\n(Image credit: Dreamstime)\n\nTypes of chocolate\n\nFine chocolate falls into three categories: dark chocolate, milk chocolate and white chocolate, Williams said.\n\nDark chocolate has chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, lecithin, sugar and vanilla.\n\nMilk chocolate has all of the above plus milk fats and milk solids.\n\nWhite chocolate contains everything milk chocolate does except chocolate liquor.\n\nChocolatiers debate whether white chocolate is really chocolate. Until 2002, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration considered it a confectionary rather than chocolate because it does not contain chocolate liquor. The Hershey Food Corp. and the Chocolate Manufacturers Association petitioned the FDA, which added a standard of identity for white chocolate. Because the FDA refers to it as white chocolate, rather than confectionary, some experts, like Williams, accept white chocolate as chocolate.\n\nWithin the three categories, the FDA also acknowledges several grades, Williams said. They include unsweetened or brute, which can be up to 99 percent chocolate liquor; bittersweet; semisweet; and dark milk chocolate. The type of chocolate depends on what ingredients are present and the percentage of cocoa, in addition to where the beans are from and the way they are prepared.\n\nHealth benefits of chocolate\n\nGood heart food\n\nSeveral recent studies have examined the role that chocolate may have on heart health. Cacao beans are full of phytonutrients, which act as antioxidants and provide additional benefits. Furthermore, cacao beans are rich sources of iron, copper, magnesium, zinc and phosphorus, according to the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Dark chocolate contains two to three times more beneficial flavanols than milk chocolate because milk chocolate\'s cacao concentration is diluted with milk and possibly more sugar.\n\nWhile most studies have found some correlation between chocolate consumption and reduced risk of heart problems, the amount and type of chocolate needed requires further study. A 2017 meta-analysis of the effects of chocolate on coronary heart disease, stroke and diabetes published in the journal Nutrients concluded that the most benefit was associated with moderate chocolate intake. The authors found little benefit in heart disease or stroke reduction among people who consumed chocolate more than three times a week. Protective effects against diabetes emerged at two servings a week, but that benefit disappeared if people had more than six servings a week.\n\nOn the other hand, the findings of a large-scale study of more than 150,000 primarily male U.S. veterans who did not have coronary artery disease at the beginning of the study, suggest that eating an ounce of chocolate at least five times a week may help prevent the risk of coronary artery disease-related events like heart attack and heart failure.\n\nChocolate may also help prevent the development of atrial fibrillation, a type of irregular heartbeat that increases the risk of heart failure, stroke and more. A study, published in the journal Heart in 2017, found that adults who ate chocolate at least once a month had 10 to 20 percent lower rates of developing atrial fibrillation than those who never or rarely ate chocolate.\n\nGood brain food\n\nChocolate may be good for the brain. Some studies have focused on chocolate\'s ability to improve cognitive function. A study published in the Journal of Alzheimer\'s Disease in 2016 found that chocolate consumption might lower the risk of cognitive decline in older people. The study looked at nearly 400 Portuguese citizens over age 65 and saw that those who ate a moderate amount of chocolate \xe2\x80\x94 on average, one chocolate snack a week; the study did not differentiate between milk and dark chocolate \xe2\x80\x94 decreased their risk of cognitive decline by 40 percent over two years. Those who ate more chocolate, or those who had more caffeine, saw fewer cognitive benefits.\n\nGood mood food\n\nChocolate is often associated with positive effects on mood, but the reasons why it makes some people feel good are debatable. Chocolate contains substances that stimulate the brain in the same way cannabis does, such as anandamines, and substances that have similar effects as amphetamine, such as tyramine and phenylethylamine, according to the Dartmouth Undergraduate Journal of Science. However, these substances are in very low concentrations \xe2\x80\x94 too low to induce an antidepressant effect.\n\nChocolate may interact with neurotransmitter systems that contribute to appetite, reward and mood regulation, such as dopamine, serotonin and endorphins, according to the 2013 article in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology. However, the authors noted, the effects may have more to do with chocolate\'s taste and smell than its chemical effects.\n\nA 2010 study published in Archives of Internal Medicine found a link between depression and chocolate consumption. The results showed that people who scored high on a screening test for depression consumed more chocolate than those who weren\'t considered depressed. However, the study pointed out that there is only a link, and cannot explain why. Since the participants were not followed over time, the researchers don\'t know whether eating chocolate ameliorates or amplifies a sad mood. The possibilities are many \xe2\x80\x94 from using chocolate as a sort of natural Prozac to the idea that chocolate might have some role in driving depression.\n\nHealth risks of eating chocolate\n\nLike many foods, chocolate is healthiest when eaten in moderation. The sugars and fats that are added to chocolate make it high in calories, which may lead to weight gain. Furthermore, many of the protective effects that chocolate may offer might be mitigated by overconsumption.\n\nHistory of chocolate\n\nScientists debate how long humans have been using and consuming cacao beans. Chocolate\'s history goes back at least 2,000 years, while historians Sophie and Michael Coe, authors of ""The True History of Chocolate"" (Thames and Hudson, 2013), suggest that it might go back four millennia. The word chocolate can be traced back to the Aztec word ""xocoatl,"" the name for a bitter drink made from cacao beans. This was the way chocolate was consumed until the Spanish conquistadors came to Central America.\n\nIn several pre-Columbian Latin American societies, cacao beans were used as currency, according to Smithsonian magazine. Mayans and Aztecs believed the beans had mystical properties and used them during important rituals. When the Spanish arrived, sweetened chocolate came into existence. Legend has it that the Aztec king Montezuma gave conquistador Hern\xc3\xa1n Cort\xc3\xa9s a bitter chocolate drink, which he said was disgusting. But Cort\xc3\xa9s\' men added cane sugar and honey to it and took it back to Spain, where it quickly became popular.\n\nChocolate was a fashionable drink for rich Europeans throughout the 18th century. The Industrial Revolution allowed chocolate to be mass-produced and brought the treat to the masses. The popularity led to the development of cacao tree plantations.\n\nEnslaved people farmed most of the plantations. Initially, Spanish colonizers forced Mesoamericans to farm the cacao plantations, according to ""The Biography of Chocolate"" (Crabtree Publishing Co., 2005), by Adrianna Morganelli. When the indigenous peoples began to die in large numbers from diseases brought by Europeans, enslaved Africans were brought over to make up the labor shortage. In addition to sugarcane, indigo and other crops, enslaved Africans planted, maintained and harvested cacao trees throughout the Caribbean, Central and South America to feed the new European taste for chocolate.\n\nIn 1815, Dutch physicist Coenraad Van Houten experimented with removing varied amounts of the cocoa butter from chocolate liquor, according to Cornell University. This led to the creation of cocoa powder and soon solid chocolate.\n\nIn 1847, a Bristol, England, chocolate company, Fry\'s, created the first mass-produced chocolate bar when Joseph Fry added additional cocoa butter to Van Houten\'s chocolate, which turned it into a moldable paste, according to Bristol Museums. Milk chocolate was invented soon after with the help of Henri Nestl\xc3\xa9, who went on to found the major food company that bears his name. Major European chocolate brands Lindt and Cadbury also got their start in the 1800s; Rodolphe Lindt invented the conching machine, which gives chocolate a velvety texture.\n\nMass chocolate consumption hit the United States in the late 1800s when Milton S. Hershey began selling chocolate-coated caramels. He then developed his own formula for milk chocolate, purchased chocolate factory equipment and introduced mass-produced chocolate bars and other shapes, like Hershey\'s Kisses, in 1900.\n\nIn 1923, the Mars Co. developed the Milky Way bar by putting nougat inside a chocolate bar. That same year, former Hershey employee H.B. Reese introduced Reese\'s Peanut Butter Cups, which later became part of the Hershey brand.\n\nAs the years progressed, chocolate concoctions from both small and large producers became increasingly innovative. In September 2017, Swiss chocolate company Barry Callebaut introduced ruby chocolate. Ruby chocolate comes from isolating specific compounds in cocoa beans, according to Confectionary News. That, along with a modified processing technique, results in a rosy pink chocolate that has a sweet but sour berry taste and no traditional chocolate flavor, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. Other colored chocolates are made from dyed white chocolate.\n\nThreats to chocolate\n\nChocolate production is threatened by climate change. According to a 2016 report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the primary cacao-producing countries of C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire, Ghana, and Indonesia will experience a 2.1 degree Celsius (3.7 degrees Fahrenheit) increase in temperature by 2050. Rainfall will not rise along with the temperature, causing lowered humidity levels. As a result, viable land for cacao production will significantly shrink. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\'s Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability report, 89.5 percent of the 294 chocolate-producing locations studied would become less suitable by 2050.\n\nFarmers and scientists are working to develop strategies to maintain chocolate production. Some farmers are planting taller trees next to cacao trees to increase shade and decrease moisture loss, according to the NOAA. Cacao plantations may also move to higher elevations with cooler temperatures and greater rainfall.\n\nGenetic scientists are taking a different approach. A January 2018 press release from the Innovative Genomics Institute announced a project to develop disease-resistant cacao. Condensing cacao plantations because of climate change could increase the spread of disease. The project will use CRISPR DNA-editing technology to make a heartier cacao seed.\n\nEthics of chocolate production\n\nAccording to Slave Free Chocolate, 2.3 million children work in chocolate production in Ghana and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire, where they are vulnerable to trafficking, slavery and other violent labor practices. The International Labor Rights Forum reports that these children are often exposed to chemicals, work long hours and are denied education. According to Epicure and Culture, many children are sold into slavery and never see their families again. Others are kidnapped.\n\nThough the Harkin-Engel Protocol of 2001 was designed to stop child labor in the chocolate industry, according to the CNN Freedom Project, little has changed. The deadlines for action have been repeatedly pushed back.\n\nConsumers who want ethical chocolate should look for certifications designating Fair Trade, Rain Forest Alliance, UTZ, and Fair for Life, according to Slave Free Chocolate\xe2\x80\x99s guide to chocolate companies.\n\nChocolate production can also harm the environment. Farmers often clear forests to make room for cacao plantations. According to the World Wildlife Fund, about 70 percent of C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire\'s illegal deforestation is related to cacao farming. One danger of deforestation is soil erosion, which can make land less fertile for cacao plants, creating a vicious cycle, according to Confectionary News.\n\nAdditional resources'";"Other";"203.txt-Other"

"209.txt";"b'The history of chocolate can be traced back more than 3,000 years to the Maya, Toltec, and Aztec people who prepared a beverage from the fruit of the cocoa bean. The Maya considered chocolate to be the food of the gods, held the cacao tree to be sacred, and buried dignitaries with bowls of chocolate.\n\nFull Article\n\nchocolate , food product made from cocoa beans , consumed as candy and used to make beverages and to flavour or coat various confections and bakery products. Rich in carbohydrates , it is an excellent source of quick energy, and it also contains minute amounts of the stimulating alkaloids theobromine and caffeine .\n\nHistory of chocolate\n\nThe cacao tree was cultivated more than 3,000 years ago by the Maya, Toltec, and Aztec peoples, who prepared a beverage from its fruit, the cocoa bean (sometimes using it as a ceremonial drink) and also used the bean as a currency. The Maya considered chocolate to be the food of the gods, held the cacao tree to be sacred, and even buried dignitaries with bowls of the substance (along with other items deemed useful in the afterlife). In fact, the identification of the (Olmec-originated) word ka-ka-w (\xe2\x80\x9ccacao\xe2\x80\x9d) inscribed on those containers was key to deciphering the Maya\xe2\x80\x99s phonetic manner of writing.\n\nSpain was the earliest European country to incorporate chocolate into its cuisine, but exactly how that happened is vague. It is known that Christopher Columbus took cocoa beans to Spain after his fourth voyage in 1502, though little was made of it at that time. It has been commonly thought (though there appears to be no evidence) that in 1519 Montezuma II, the Aztec ruler of Mexico, served a bitter cocoa-bean drink to the Spanish conquistador Hern\xc3\xa1n Cort\xc3\xa9s, who subsequently introduced the drink to Spain. A strong possibility is that chocolate first arrived in Spain in 1544 with representatives of the Kekch\xc3\xad Mayan people of Guatemala, who came bearing gifts (including chocolate) to visit the court of Prince Philip. However, it was not until 1585 that the first recorded shipment of cocoa beans arrived in Spain from Veracruz, Mexico. Sweetened and flavoured with cinnamon and vanilla, chocolate was served as a hot beverage and became quite popular in the Spanish court. It was many years before chocolate had its introduction to France, England, and beyond.\n\nengraving of an Aztec with cocoa beans and chocolate beverage \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican with his chocolate pot and goblet,\xe2\x80\x9d an engraving of an Aztec with cocoa beans and chocolate beverage, from a French history of chocolate, tea, and coffee, 1685. From Traitez Nouveaux and curieux du caf\xc3\xa9 du th\xc3\xa9 et du chocolate, by Philippe Sylvestre Dufour, 1685\n\nIn 1657 a Frenchman opened a shop in London at which solid chocolate for making the beverage could be purchased at 10 to 15 shillings per pound. At that price only the wealthy could afford to drink it, and there appeared in London, Amsterdam, and other European capitals fashionable chocolate houses, some of which later developed into famous private clubs. In London many chocolate houses were used as political party meeting places as well as high-stakes gambling spots, notably Cocoa-Tree Chocolate-House (later the Cocoa-Tree Club), which opened in 1698, and White\xe2\x80\x99s, which was opened by Francis White in 1693 as White\xe2\x80\x99s Chocolate-House. About 1700 the English improved chocolate by the addition of milk. The reduction of the cost of the beverage was hampered in Great Britain by the imposition of high import duties on the raw cocoa bean, and it was not until the mid-19th century, when the duty was lowered to a uniform rate of one penny per pound, that chocolate became popular.\n\nMeanwhile, the making of chocolate spread overseas and grew in sophistication. Chocolate manufacture started in the American colonies in 1765 at Dorchester, Massachusetts, using beans brought in by New England sea captains from their voyages to the West Indies. James Baker financed the first mill, which was operated by an Irish immigrant, John Hanan. Waterpower was used for grinding the beans. In the Netherlands in 1828, C.J. van Houten patented a process for pressing much of the fat, or cocoa butter, from ground and roasted cocoa beans and thus obtaining cocoa powder. In 1847 the English firm of Fry and Sons combined cocoa butter with chocolate liquor and sugar to produce sweet (eating) chocolate\xe2\x80\x94the base of most chocolate confectionary\xe2\x80\x94and in 1876 Daniel Peter of Switzerland added dried milk to make milk chocolate. The proliferation of flavoured, solid, and coated chocolate foods rapidly followed.'";"Other";"209.txt-Other"
"210.txt";"b'Share on Pinterest Screen Moment/Stocksy United Dark chocolate is loaded with nutrients that can positively affect your health. Made from the seed of the cacao tree, it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the best sources of antioxidants you can find. Studies show that dark chocolate can improve your health and lower the risk of heart disease. This article reviews 7 health benefits of dark chocolate or cocoa that are supported by science.\n\n1. Very nutritious If you buy quality dark chocolate with a high cocoa content, then it\xe2\x80\x99s quite nutritious. It contains a decent amount of soluble fiber and is loaded with minerals. A 100-gram bar of dark chocolate with 70\xe2\x80\x9385% cocoa contains (1): 11 grams of fiber\n\n67% of the DV for iron\n\n58% of the DV for magnesium\n\n89% of the DV for copper\n\n98% of the DV for manganese In addition, it has plenty of potassium, phosphorus, zinc, and selenium. Of course, 100 grams (3.5 ounces) is a fairly large amount and not something you should be consuming daily. These nutrients also come with 600 calories and moderate amounts of sugar. For this reason, dark chocolate is best consumed in moderation. The fatty acid profile of cocoa and dark chocolate is also good. The fats consist mostly of oleic acid (a heart-healthy fat also found in olive oil), stearic acid, and palmitic acid. The stearic acid has a neutral effect on body cholesterol. Palmitic acid can raise cholesterol levels, but it only makes up one-third of the total fat calories. Dark chocolate also contains stimulants like caffeine and theobromine, but it\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely to keep you awake at night, as the amount of caffeine is very small compared with coffee. Summary Quality dark chocolate is rich in fiber, iron, magnesium, copper, manganese, and a few other minerals.\n\n2. Powerful source of antioxidants ORAC stands for oxygen radical absorbance capacity. It\xe2\x80\x99s a measure of the antioxidant activity of foods. Basically, researchers set a bunch of free radicals (bad) against a sample of a food and see how well the antioxidants in the food can disarm the free radicals. The biological relevance of ORAC values is questioned, as it\xe2\x80\x99s measured in a test tube and may not have the same effect in the body. However, it\xe2\x80\x99s worth mentioning that raw, unprocessed cocoa beans are among the highest-scoring foods that have been tested. Dark chocolate is loaded with organic compounds that are biologically active and function as antioxidants. These include polyphenols, flavanols and catechins, among others. One study showed that cocoa and dark chocolate had more antioxidant activity, polyphenols, and flavanols than any other fruits tested, which included blueberries and acai berries (2). Summary Cocoa and dark chocolate have a wide variety of powerful antioxidants. In fact, they have way more than most other foods.\n\n3. May improve blood flow and lower blood pressure The flavanols in dark chocolate can stimulate the endothelium, the lining of arteries, to produce nitric oxide (NO) ( 3 ). One of the functions of NO is to send signals to the arteries to relax, which lowers the resistance to blood flow and therefore reduces blood pressure. Many controlled studies show that cocoa and dark chocolate can improve blood flow and lower blood pressure, though the effects are usually mild ( 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ). However, one study in people with high blood pressure showed no effect, so take this with a grain of salt ( 8 ). Given the great variation between studies on this subject, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that more research is needed ( 9 , 10). Summary The bioactive compounds in cocoa may improve blood flow in the arteries and cause a small but statistically significant decrease in blood pressure.\n\n4. Raises HDL and protects LDL from oxidation Consuming dark chocolate can improve several important risk factors for heart disease. In a controlled study, cocoa powder was found to significantly decrease oxidized LDL (bad) cholesterol in men. It also increased HDL and lowered total LDL for those with high cholesterol ( 11 ). Oxidized LDL means that the LDL cholesterol has reacted with free radicals. This makes the LDL particle itself reactive and capable of damaging other tissues, such as the lining of the arteries in your heart. It makes perfect sense that cocoa lowers oxidized LDL. It contains an abundance of powerful antioxidants that do make it into the bloodstream and protect lipoproteins against oxidative damage ( 12 , 13 , 14 ). The flavanols in dark chocolate can also reduce insulin resistance, which is another common risk factor for diseases like heart disease and diabetes ( 15 , 16 , 17 ). However, dark chocolate also contains sugar, which can have the opposite effect. Summary Dark chocolate improves several important risk factors for disease. It lowers the susceptibility of LDL to oxidative damage while increasing HDL and improving insulin sensitivity.\n\n5. May reduce heart disease risk The compounds in dark chocolate appear to be highly protective against the oxidation of LDL. In the long term, this should cause much less cholesterol to lodge in the arteries, resulting in a lower risk of heart disease. In fact, several long-term observational studies show a fairly drastic improvement. In a study of 470 older men, cocoa was found to reduce the risk of death from heart disease by 50% over 15 years ( 18 ). Another study revealed that eating chocolate two or more times per week lowered the risk of having calcified plaque in the arteries by 32%. Eating chocolate less frequently had no effect ( 19 ). Yet another study showed that eating dark chocolate more than five times per week lowered the risk of heart disease by 57% ( 20 ). A 2017 clinical trial found that subjects who consumed almonds with or without dark chocolate showed improved LDL cholesterol levels (21). Of course, these four studies are observational, so it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear exactly if it was the chocolate that reduced the risk. However, since the biological process is known (lower blood pressure and oxidized LDL), it\xe2\x80\x99s plausible that regularly eating dark chocolate may reduce the risk of heart disease. Summary Observational studies show a drastic reduction in heart disease risk among those who consume the most chocolate.\n\n6. May protect your skin from the sun The bioactive compounds in dark chocolate may also be great for your skin. The flavanols can protect against sun damage, improve blood flow to the skin, and increase skin density and hydration ( 22 ). The minimal erythemal dose (MED) is the minimum amount of UVB rays required to cause redness in the skin 24 hours after exposure. In one study of 30 people, the MED more than doubled after consuming dark chocolate high in flavanols for 12 weeks ( 23 ). If you\xe2\x80\x99re planning a beach vacation, consider enjoying some extra dark chocolate in the prior weeks and months. But check with your doctor or dermatologist before forgoing your normal skin care routine in favor of more dark chocolate. Summary Studies show that the flavanols from cocoa can improve blood flow to the skin and protect it from sun damage.\n\n7. Could improve brain function The good news isn\xe2\x80\x99t over yet. Dark chocolate may also improve the function of your brain. One study of healthy volunteers showed that eating high flavanol cocoa for 5 days improved blood flow to the brain ( 24 ). Cocoa may also significantly improve cognitive function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment. It may improve verbal fluency and several risk factors for disease, as well ( 25 ). Additionally, cocoa contains stimulant substances like caffeine and theobromine, which may be a key reason why it can improve brain function in the short term ( 26 ). Summary Cocoa or dark chocolate may improve brain function by increasing blood flow. It also contains stimulants like caffeine and theobromine.'";"Other";"210.txt-Other"

"219.txt";"b'When most of us hear the word chocolate, we picture a bar, a box of bonbons, or a bunny. The verb that comes to mind is probably ""eat,"" not ""drink,"" and the most apt adjective would seem to be ""sweet."" But for about 90 percent of chocolate\'s long history, it was strictly a beverage, and sugar didn\'t have anything to do with it.\n\n""I often call chocolate the best-known food that nobody knows anything about,"" said Alexandra Leaf, a self-described ""chocolate educator"" who runs a business called Chocolate Tours of New York City.\n\nThe terminology can be a little confusing, but most experts these days use the term ""cacao"" to refer to the plant or its beans before processing, while the term ""chocolate"" refers to anything made from the beans, she explained. ""Cocoa"" generally refers to chocolate in a powdered form, although it can also be a British form of ""cacao.""\n\nEtymologists trace the origin of the word ""chocolate"" to the Aztec word ""xocoatl,"" which referred to a bitter drink brewed from cacao beans. The Latin name for the cacao tree, Theobroma cacao, means ""food of the gods.""\n\nMany modern historians have estimated that chocolate has been around for about 2000 years, but recent research suggests that it may be even older.\n\nIn the book The True History of Chocolate, authors Sophie and Michael Coe make a case that the earliest linguistic evidence of chocolate consumption stretches back three or even four millennia, to pre-Columbian cultures of Mesoamerica such as the Olmec.\n\nLast November, anthropologists from the University of Pennsylvania announced the discovery of cacao residue on pottery excavated in Honduras that could date back as far as 1400 B.C.E. It appears that the sweet pulp of the cacao fruit, which surrounds the beans, was fermented into an alcoholic beverage of the time.\n\n""Who would have thought, looking at this, that you can eat it?"" said Richard Hetzler, executive chef of the caf\xc3\xa9 at the Smithsonian\'s National Museum of the American Indian, as he displayed a fresh cacao pod during a recent chocolate-making demonstration. ""You would have to be pretty hungry, and pretty creative!""\n\nIt\'s hard to pin down exactly when chocolate was born, but it\'s clear that it was cherished from the start. For several centuries in pre-modern Latin America, cacao beans were considered valuable enough to use as currency. One bean could be traded for a tamale, while 100 beans could purchase a good turkey hen, according to a 16th-century Aztec document.\n\nBoth the Mayans and Aztecs believed the cacao bean had magical, or even divine, properties, suitable for use in the most sacred rituals of birth, marriage and death. According to Chloe Doutre-Roussel\'s book The Chocolate Connoisseur, Aztec sacrifice victims who felt too melancholy to join in ritual dancing before their death were often given a gourd of chocolate (tinged with the blood of previous victims) to cheer them up. Sweetened chocolate didn\'t appear until Europeans discovered the Americas and sampled the native cuisine. Legend has it that the Aztec king Montezuma welcomed the Spanish explorer Hernando Cortes with a banquet that included drinking chocolate, having tragically mistaken him for a reincarnated deity instead of a conquering invader. Chocolate didn\'t suit the foreigners\' tastebuds at first \xe2\x80\x93one described it in his writings as ""a bitter drink for pigs"" \xe2\x80\x93 but once mixed with honey or cane sugar, it quickly became popular throughout Spain. By the 17th century, chocolate was a fashionable drink throughout Europe, believed to have nutritious, medicinal and even aphrodisiac properties (it\'s rumored that Casanova was especially fond of the stuff). But it remained largely a privilege of the rich until the invention of the steam engine made mass production possible in the late 1700s. In 1828, a Dutch chemist found a way to make powdered chocolate by removing about half the natural fat (cacao butter) from chocolate liquor, pulverizing what remained and treating the mixture with alkaline salts to cut the bitter taste. His product became known as ""Dutch cocoa,"" and it soon led to the creation of solid chocolate. The creation of the first modern chocolate bar is credited to Joseph Fry, who in 1847 discovered that he could make a moldable chocolate paste by adding melted cacao butter back into Dutch cocoa. By 1868, a little company called Cadbury was marketing boxes of chocolate candies in England. Milk chocolate hit the market a few years later, pioneered by another name that may ring a bell \xe2\x80\x93 Nestle. In America, chocolate was so valued during the Revolutionary War that it was included in soldiers\' rations and used in lieu of wages. While most of us probably wouldn\'t settle for a chocolate paycheck these days, statistics show that the humble cacao bean is still a powerful economic force. Chocolate manufacturing is a more than 4-billion-dollar industry in the United States, and the average American eats at least half a pound of the stuff per month. In the 20th century, the word ""chocolate"" expanded to include a range of affordable treats with more sugar and additives than actual cacao in them, often made from the hardiest but least flavorful of the bean varieties (forastero). But more recently, there\'s been a ""chocolate revolution,"" Leaf said, marked by an increasing interest in high-quality, handmade chocolates and sustainable, effective cacao farming and harvesting methods. Major corporations like Hershey\'s have expanded their artisanal chocolate lines by purchasing smaller producers known for premium chocolates, such as Scharffen Berger and Dagoba, while independent chocolatiers continue to flourish as well. ""I see more and more American artisans doing incredible things with chocolate,"" Leaf said. ""Although, I admit that I tend to look at the world through cocoa-tinted glasses.""'";"Other";"219.txt-Other"
"224.txt";"b'Is Chocolate Good for Your Heart?\n\nWhy a little, in moderation, may be beneficial\n\nChocolate has gotten a lot of media coverage in recent years because it\'s believed that it may help protect your cardiovascular system. The reasoning being that the cocoa bean is rich in a class of plant nutrients called flavonoids.\n\nFlavonoids help protect plants from environmental toxins and help repair damage. They can be found in a variety of foods, such as fruits and vegetables. When we eat foods rich in flavonoids, it appears that we also benefit from this ""antioxidant"" power.\n\nAntioxidants are believed to help the body\'s cells resist damage caused by free radicals that are formed by normal bodily processes, such as breathing, and from environmental contaminants, like cigarette smoke. If your body does not have enough antioxidants to combat the amount of oxidation that occurs, it can become damaged by free radicals. For example, an increase in oxidation can cause low-density lipoprotein (LDL), also known as ""bad"" cholesterol, to form plaque on the artery walls.\n\nFlavanols are the main type of flavonoid found in cocoa and chocolate. In addition to having antioxidant qualities, research shows that flavanols have other potential influences on vascular health, such as lowering blood pressure, improving blood flow to the brain and heart, and making blood platelets less sticky and able to clot.\n\nThese plant chemicals aren\xe2\x80\x99t only found in chocolate. In fact, a wide variety of foods and beverages are rich in flavonols. These include cranberries, apples, peanuts, onions, tea and red wine.\n\nAre all types of chocolate healthy?\n\nBefore you grab a chocolate candy bar or slice of chocolate cake, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand that not all forms of chocolate contain high levels of flavanols.\n\nCocoa naturally has a very strong, pungent taste, which comes from the flavanols. When cocoa is processed into your favorite chocolate products, it goes through several steps to reduce this taste. The more chocolate is processed (through things like fermentation, alkalizing, roasting, etc.), the more flavanols are lost.\n\nMost commercial chocolates are highly processed. Although it was once believed that dark chocolate contained the highest levels of flavanols, recent research indicates that, depending on how the dark chocolate was processed, this may not be true. The good news is that most major chocolate manufacturers are looking for ways to keep the flavanols in their processed chocolates. But for now, your best choices are likely dark chocolate over milk chocolate (especially milk chocolate that is loaded with other fats and sugars) and cocoa powder that has not undergone Dutch processing (cocoa that is treated with an alkali to neutralize its natural acidity).\n\nWhat about all of the fat in chocolate?\n\nYou may be surprised to learn that chocolate isn\xe2\x80\x99t as bad for you as once believed.\n\nThe fat in chocolate comes from cocoa butter and is made up of equal amounts of oleic acid (a heart-healthy monounsaturated fat also found in olive oil), stearic and palmitic acids. Stearic and palmitic acids are forms of saturated fat. You may know that saturated fats are linked to increases in LDL cholesterol and the risk of heart disease.\n\nBut, research shows that stearic acid appears to have a neutral effect on cholesterol, neither raising nor lowering it. Although palmitic acid does affect cholesterol levels, it only makes up one-third of the fat calories in chocolate. Still, this does not mean you can eat all the dark chocolate you\xe2\x80\x99d like.\n\nFirst, be careful about the type of dark chocolate you choose: chewy caramel-marshmallow-nut-covered dark chocolate is by no means a heart-healthy food option. Watch out for those extra ingredients that can add lots of extra fat and calories. Second, there is currently no established serving size of chocolate to help you reap the cardiovascular benefits it may offer, and more research is needed in this area. However, we do know that you no longer need to feel guilty if you enjoy a small piece of dark chocolate once in a while.\n\nSo, for now, enjoy moderate portions of chocolate (e.g., 1 ounce) a few times per week, and don\xe2\x80\x99t forget to eat other flavonoid-rich foods like apples, red wine, tea, onions and cranberries.'";"Other";"224.txt-Other"

The more chocolate is processed (through things like fermentation, alkalizing, roasting, etc.), the more flavanols are lost.\n\nMost commercial chocolates are highly processed. Although it was once believed that dark chocolate contained the highest levels of flavanols, recent research indicates that, depending on how the dark chocolate was processed, this may not be true. The good news is that most major chocolate manufacturers are looking for ways to keep the flavanols in their processed chocolates. But for now, your best choices are likely dark chocolate over milk chocolate (especially milk chocolate that is loaded with other fats and sugars) and cocoa powder that has not undergone Dutch processing (cocoa that is treated with an alkali to neutralize its natural acidity).\n\nWhat about all of the fat in chocolate?\n\nYou may be surprised to learn that chocolate isn\xe2\x80\x99t as bad for you as once believed.\n\nThe fat in chocolate comes from cocoa butter and is made up of equal amounts of oleic acid (a heart-healthy monounsaturated fat also found in olive oil), stearic and palmitic acids. Stearic and palmitic acids are forms of saturated fat. You may know that saturated fats are linked to increases in LDL cholesterol and the risk of heart disease.\n\nBut, research shows that stearic acid appears to have a neutral effect on cholesterol, neither raising nor lowering it. Although palmitic acid does affect cholesterol levels, it only makes up one-third of the fat calories in chocolate. Still, this does not mean you can eat all the dark chocolate you\xe2\x80\x99d like.\n\nFirst, be careful about the type of dark chocolate you choose: chewy caramel-marshmallow-nut-covered dark chocolate is by no means a heart-healthy food option. Watch out for those extra ingredients that can add lots of extra fat and calories. Second, there is currently no established serving size of chocolate to help you reap the cardiovascular benefits it may offer, and more research is needed in this area. However, we do know that you no longer need to feel guilty if you enjoy a small piece of dark chocolate once in a while.\n\nSo, for now, enjoy moderate portions of chocolate (e.g., 1 ounce) a few times per week, and don\xe2\x80\x99t forget to eat other flavonoid-rich foods like apples, red wine, tea, onions and cranberries.'";"Other";"23.txt-Other"
"231.txt";"b""Originally consumed as a bitter drink, it was prized as both an aphrodisiac and an energy booster.\n\nMankind\xe2\x80\x99s love affair with chocolate stretches back more than five millennia. Produced from the seeds of tropical cacao trees native to the rainforests of Central and South America, chocolate was long considered the \xe2\x80\x9cfood of the gods,\xe2\x80\x9d and later, a delicacy for the elite. But for most of its history, it was actually consumed as a bitter beverage rather than the sweet, edible treat it has become worldwide.\n\nWhat Is the Birthplace of Chocolate?\n\nMayan cacao drink Ren Photo/Getty Images\n\nArchaeologists have discovered the earliest traces of cacao in pottery used by the ancient Mayo-Chinchipe culture 5,300 years ago in the upper Amazon region of Ecuador. Chocolate played an important political, spiritual and economic role in ancient Mesoamerican civilizations, which ground roasted cacao beans into a paste that they mixed with water, vanilla, chili peppers and other spices to brew a frothy chocolate drink.\n\nAncient Mesoamericans believed chocolate was an energy booster and aphrodisiac with mystical and medicinal qualities. The Mayans, who considered cacao a gift from the gods, used chocolate for sacred ceremonies and funeral offerings. Wealthy Mayans drank foaming chocolate drinks, while commoners consumed chocolate in a cold porridge-like dish.\n\nAs people of the Aztec empire spread across Mesoamerica in the 1400s, they too began to prize cacao. Since they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t grow it in the dry highlands of central Mexico, they traded with the Mayans for the beans, which they even used as currency. (In the 1500s, Aztecs could purchase a turkey hen or a hare for 100 beans.) By one account, the 16th-century Aztec ruler Moctezuma II drank 50 cups of chocolate a day out of a golden goblet to increase his libido.\n\nWATCH: Season 1 of The Food That Built America without signing in now.\n\nSpaniards Introduce Chocolate to Europe\xe2\x80\x99s Elite\n\nChocolate arrived in Europe during the 1500s, likely brought by both Spanish friars and conquistadors who had traveled to the Americas. Although the Spanish sweetened the bitter drink with cane sugar and cinnamon, one thing remained unchanged: Chocolate reigned as a delectable symbol of luxury, wealth and power\xe2\x80\x94an expensive import sipped by royal lips, and affordable only to Spanish elites.\n\nChocolate\xe2\x80\x99s popularity eventually spread to other European courts, where aristocrats consumed it as a magic elixir with health benefits. To slake their growing thirst for chocolate, European powers established colonial plantations in equatorial regions around the world to grow cacao and sugar. When diseases brought by Europeans depleted the native Mesoamerican labor pool, African slaves were imported to the Americas to work on the plantations and maintain chocolate production.\n\nChocolate remained an aristocratic nectar until the 1828 invention of the cocoa press revolutionized its production. Attributed in varying accounts to either Dutch chemist Coenraad Johannes van Houten or his father, Casparus, the cocoa press squeezed the fatty butter from roasted cacao beans, leaving behind a dry cake that could be pulverized into a fine powder that could be mixed with liquids and other ingredients, poured into molds and solidified into edible, easily digestible chocolate. The cocoa press ushered in the modern era of chocolate by enabling it to be used as a confectionary ingredient, and the resulting drop in production costs made chocolate much more affordable.\n\nREAD MORE: Why the Candy Bar Market Exploded After WWI\n\nChocolate Becomes a Treat for the Masses\n\n10 Gallery 10 Images\n\nIn 1847, British chocolate company J.S. Fry & Sons created the first edible chocolate bar from cocoa butter, cocoa powder and sugar. Rival chocolatier Cadbury\xe2\x80\x99s, credited with pioneering the Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day chocolate box and chocolate Easter egg, followed suit soon after and in 1854 earned a royal warrant as purveyors of chocolate to Queen Victoria.\n\nIt was in Switzerland that chocolate production took one of its greatest leaps forward. In the 1870s, Swiss chocolatier Daniel Peter utilized a powdered milk developed several years earlier by his neighbor Henri Nestl\xc3\xa9 to produce the first milk chocolate bar, and the pair eventually formed the Nestl\xc3\xa9 Company. Swiss chocolatier Rodolphe Lindt\xe2\x80\x99s 1879 invention of the conching machine\xe2\x80\x94which used large stone rollers to mix and aerate chocolate to give it a velvety texture and superior taste\xe2\x80\x94allowed for the mass production of smooth, creamy milk chocolate.\n\nIn the United States, Milton Hershey pioneered the assembly-line production of milk chocolate. After selling his caramel candy company for $1 million and producing his first milk chocolate bar in 1900, Hershey bought farmland near his birthplace in rural Pennsylvania and built an entire factory town devoted to chocolate. The grass-fed Holsteins on the surrounding dairy farms supplied the company\xe2\x80\x99s milk, and a company town in Cuba supplied its sugar.\n\nREAD MORE: How Hershey's Chocolate Helped Power Allied Troops in WWII\n\nChocolate bars soared in popularity during the Roaring Twenties. By the end of the decade, more than 40,000 different candy bars were being made in the U.S., according to Susan Benjamin, candy historian and author of Sweet as Sin: The Unwrapped Story of How Candy Became America\xe2\x80\x99s Favorite Pleasure. Father-and-son duo Frank C. Mars and Forrest Mars Sr. collaborated on the idea for the Milky Way bar, which hit the market in 1923 with the chocolate for its coating supplied by Hershey\xe2\x80\x99s. The family-owned business would rival Hershey\xe2\x80\x99s, and Forrest Mars Sr. later partnered with the son of a Hershey\xe2\x80\x99s executive to begin production of M&M candies in 1941.\n\nH.B. Reese, who had worked as a dairy farmer and shipping foreman for Hershey\xe2\x80\x99s, launched his own candy company in 1923 and five years later introduced Reese\xe2\x80\x99s Peanut Butter Cups. They later came to be produced by Hershey\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94and one of the top-selling candies in the United States.\n\nFrom its roots more than 5,000 years ago, chocolate has become a big business. According to research by Statista, retail sales of chocolate worldwide in 2016 totaled nearly $100 billion, including almost $25 billion in the United States alone. While the cacao plant is native to the Americas, its cultivation has now shifted to Africa, which is now the source of more than two-thirds of worldwide cocoa production.\n\nWATCH: Full episodes of The Food That Built America online now.""";"Other";"231.txt-Other"
"258.txt";"b'Cocoa butter composition\n\nPrior to any refining, the fatty-acid composition of the CB used in this study was determined by gas-liquid chromatography. The CB used in this study is mainly composed of stearic acid (37.3%), palmitic acid (25.4%), and oleic acid (33.5%) (Supplementary Table 1), which closely matches typical literature values4. The phosphorus content of the unrefined CB is 88 \xc2\xb1 1 ppm, or 0.263 \xc2\xb1 0.004% equivalent phosphatides by weight (Supplementary Table 2), which is similar to the 0.34 \xc2\xb1 0.07% reported by Arruda and Dimick6. After refining, the phospholipids are completely removed from the CB. The FFA content of the unrefined CB is 1.65 \xc2\xb1 0.01% (as oleic acid) (Supplementary Table 3), which complies with the requirement of having <1.75% FFAs as oleic acid in Codex standards. This is reduced to 0.06% after neutralization and bleaching.\n\nCrystal structure and polymorphism\n\nPowder X-ray diffraction is the most unambiguous method for determining CB TAG polymorphism. In this study, CB samples were melted at 80 \xc2\xb0C for 30 min to clear the memory of crystallization and then crystallized statically at 23 \xc2\xb0C in an incubator for 1 day. Form IV displays wide-angle reflections corresponding to short spacings of 4.35, 4.15, 3.97, and 3.81 \xc3\x85, Form V has short spacings of 4.58, 3.98, 3.87, 3.75, and 3.67 \xc3\x85, while Form VI has short spacings of 4.59, 3.86, and 3.70 \xc3\x8510. Unrefined CB displays reflections corresponding to short spacings of 4.61, 3.88, and 3.71 \xc3\x85, which is characteristic of Form VI, matching literature values closely (Fig. 1; Supplementary Table 4)10. Additionally, the small-angle reflections corresponding to long spacings of 68.16 and 32.89 \xc3\x85 further suggest a Form VI polymorphism and a 3 L structure (polytype)11. CB TAGs in Forms V and VI stack as lamellae in the [001] direction with a dimension, which is proportional to three fatty-acid chain lengths, hence the nomenclature \xe2\x80\x9c3 L\xe2\x80\x9d. Other polymorphic forms stack as 2 L structures, the more common polytypic arrangement12.\n\nFig. 1: Powder X-ray diffraction patterns and differential scanning calorimetric traces (inset) of unrefined native CB, refined CB, and refined CB with added minor lipidic components. Samples included a unrefined native CB, b refined CB, c refined CB with added 0.1% (w/w) dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, and d refined CB with added 0.1% (w/w) dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine. Samples were crystallized statically at 23 \xc2\xb0C for 24 h. Full size image\n\nIn contrast, the refined CB sample displays a pattern that resembles a blend of Forms IV and V. Short spacings of 4.35 and 4.18 \xc3\x85 agree with literature values for Form IV, while 4.60, 3.99, 3.88, and 3.77 \xc3\x85 match those of Form V11. Furthermore, the long spacings include both 2 L (45.20 \xc3\x85) and 3 L (65.57 and 32.69 \xc3\x85) arrangements, indicative of the presence of Forms IV and V, respectively11. Thus, it appears that the removal of minor components in CB through refining drastically changes the crystal structure of CB.\n\nThe wide-angle region of powder XRD spectra of refined CB with minor components added back is generally characteristic of Form V, or a blend of Forms IV and V (Fig. 1c, d and Supplementary Fig. 1 (a\xe2\x80\x93f)). In the small-angle region, diffraction patterns suggest that the 3 L structure is present in all samples. Long spacings in the range 64\xe2\x80\x9368 \xc3\x85 correspond to the reflections of the (001) crystal plane. Higher-order reflections, up to ones corresponding to the (009) plane of this lamellar crystal, are also evident. However, there is also varying amounts of the 2 L structure present in the various samples, specifically Form IV, which imparts undesirable properties and stability to CB and chocolate, including a low melting point and excessive softness12. The DMPC, GMP, GMO, and FFA samples have little to no 2 L structure present, indicated by the lack of a (001) plane reflection corresponding to ~45 \xc3\x85. In contrast, DPPE and GMS CB samples display a strong 2 L reflection, suggesting a mixture of 2 L and 3 L structures.\n\nMelting point and enthalpy of fusion\n\nThe melting points and enthalpies of fusion determined by DSC were compared across the CB samples and are shown in Table 1. Example DSC curves are presented for each sample in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2. Wille and Lutton reported the melting temperatures for Forms I through VI as 17.3, 23.3. 25.5, 27.5, 33.9, and 36.3 \xc2\xb0C10, while Lovegren et al.13 reported lower melting temperatures for the same six polymorphs as 13, 20, 23, 25, 30, and 33.5 \xc2\xb0C. The melting point of the unrefined CB used in our study closely matches that of Form VI, as reported by Willie and Lutton10. However, once the CB is refined, the melting point drops to 28.8 \xc2\xb0C, indicative of Form IV. After adding specific minor components back into the refined CB, the melting temperature increases again. Phospholipid and MAG addition to refined CB yield samples with melting points in the range of 29.8\xe2\x80\x9332.2 \xc2\xb0C, suggesting that the CB crystals are in transition from Form IV to Form V, as reported by Wille and Lutton10. Finally, when FFAs are added to refined CB, the melting temperature increases back to about 34 \xc2\xb0C, which may indicate a mixture of Forms V and VI, as it is also similar to Form VI\xe2\x80\x99s melting point of 33.5 \xc2\xb0C13. These results are all in agreement with the XRD data.\n\nTable 1 Melting point and enthalpy of fusion of unrefined native CB, refined CB, and refined CB with added minor lipidic components. Full size table\n\nThe enthalpies of fusion follow a similar trend, with a higher enthalpy of fusion (143.9 J/g) for unrefined CB, which decreases significantly after refining (110.9 J/g). Again, the phospholipids and MAGs have a much smaller effect, if any, compared to the FFAs. With the FFA samples, the enthalpies of fusion are similar to that of the unrefined CB. Guthrie reported an enthalpy of 147 J/g for Form V CB, which decreased for less stable forms14.\n\nCrystallization kinetics\n\nThe crystallization kinetics of the CB samples were quantified using half-times derived from the Avrami model fitted to the SFC-temperature data, as shown in Fig. 2, with the calculated Avrami constants shown in Supplementary Table 515.\n\nFig. 2: Static crystallization growth curve of unrefined native CB, refined CB, and refined CB with added minor lipidic components crystallized at 23 \xc2\xb0C (symbols) and corresponding fits to the Avrami model (solid lines). The inset table indicates the half-times of crystallization derived form model fits. Refining CB accelerates its crystallization (a), as does 0.1% (w/w) phospholipid addition (b). Addition of 0.5% (w/w) saturated monoacylglycerols, glycerol monostearate, and glycerol monopalmitate, do not significantly affect crystallization kinetics, while addition of the unsaturated glycerol monooletate does (c). Free fatty-acid addition to refined CB at 0.5% (w/w) levels accelerates crystallization for stearic, palmitic, and oleic acids equally (d). Values represent means and standard errors of three replicates and values with the same superscript letter are not significantly different (P > 0.05). Full size image\n\nUnrefined CB has the longest half-time of crystallization at 281.9 min, which decreases to 202.3 min after refining. Statistically significant decreases (P < 0.05) in the half time of crystallization of unrefined CB are observed after addition of DMPC, DPPE, GMO, and all free fatty acids tested, including palmitic, stearic, and oleic acids. Chaiseri and Dimick reported that different phospholipids had different effects on crystallization rate, with certain phospholipids such as lysophosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol retarding nucleation, while others such as phosphatidylcholine promoting nucleation. They also highlighted that removing phospholipids through refining decreased the crystallization rate, indicating that phospholids may be necessary as initial crystallization seeds in CB1. This agrees with the data presented in this study, with the addition of phospholipids increasing crystallization rate. Arruda and Dimick reported a much higher relative concentration of phospholipids in seed crystals than in bulk CB, with the majority being phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine6. Thus, it appears that the added phospholipids may aid in the nucleation of CB TAGs.\n\nThe FFA and GMO CB samples have a slightly shorter half-time of crystallization relative to the refined CB sample, but the effects of palmitic and oleic acid are not statistically significant (P > 0.05). M\xc3\xbcller and Careglio focused their study specifically on FFAs, and reported slower crystal growth of unrefined CB with added stearic, palmitic, and oleic acids7. However, we do not observe this in our study. Chaiseri and Dimick reported that saturated free fatty acids increased the crystallization rate in the early stages of CB crystallization1.\n\nFew studies have been conducted on the effect of MAGs on CB crystallization. Chaiseri and Dimick suggested that their effects are small due to their low concentration in CB1. In our study, GMS and GMP, both saturated monoglycerides, do not significantly affect CB crystallization kinetics. Surprisingly, the unsaturated monoglyceride GMO enhances CB crystallization.\n\nPolarized light microscopy\n\nLight microscopy revealed subtle differences in the microstructure of the different CB samples (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 3). Although all images display feather-like spherulitic structures, the unrefined sample has smaller spherulites. DPPE addition, interestingly, leads to the formation of larger spherulites with a different texture than upon DMPC addition. The spherulites of the refined and DPPE samples display granular structures in the centre of the spherulites and feather-like crystallites in the periphery. The MAG samples all exhibit similar crystal morphologies, with both granular structures and small feather-like spherulites present. This is similar to the stearic and palmitic acid samples, though the FFA samples display a more granular structure. It appears that the MAG and FFA samples, excluding the oleic acid sample, revert the CB to the morphology of the unrefined sample. However, the oleic acid sample differs greatly from the rest, displaying large spherulites analogous to the refined CB sample.\n\nFig. 3: Polarized light microscopy images of unrefined native CB, refined CB, and refined CB with and without added minor lipidic components. Samples included a unrefined native CB, b refined CB, c refined CB with added 0.1% (w/w) dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, and d refined CB with added 0.1% (w/w) dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine. Samples were crystallized statically at 23 \xc2\xb0C for 24 h. Intensity and contrast were auto-levelled. Full size image\n\nAn aspect that became clear during the microscopy studies is that the spatial distribution of mass of CB is affected by the refining process and subsequent addition of minor lipidic components. One way to quantify this spatial distribution of mass is by determining the box-counting fractal dimension (D box ) of the images. A high fractal dimension is associated with a greater fill of the available embedding space with crystalline mass, as well as a higher order in the distribution of this crystalline mass. The box-counting fractal dimension provides a value that quantifies the level of space-filling, as well as self-similarity within a structure, which can be related to the nucleation process of CB. Supplementary Table 6 lists these values. The unrefined and stearic acid samples have the lowest average fractal dimension, with D box = 1.63 and 1.62, respectively. In contrast, the sample with the highest fractal dimension is the refined sample at D box = 1.75, followed by the phospholipid samples at ~1.72. Samples with a higher fractal dimension are expected to have originated from a higher nucleation rate, as this leads to more homogenous growth across an area. On the other hand, slower nucleation rates would result in more heterogeneous growth, leading to a lower fractal dimension for the resulting mass distribution 16.\n\nInterestingly, here we also discovered a statistically significant (r = 0.77, P < 0.01) inverse correlation between the melting temperature of the samples and their fractal dimension, as shown in Fig. 4. This may be related to the polymorphism of each sample and its corresponding nucleation process. For the unrefined sample, a high melting temperature of 36.4 \xc2\xb0C indicates the presence of the Form VI polymorph. The higher free energy of nucleation for this most stable polymorph results in low nucleation rates, leading to a more heterogeneous mass distribution and a lower fractal dimension. Conversely, the lower melting temperature of the refined sample suggests a mixture of Forms IV and V, which are metastable polymorphs. These polymorphic forms have greater rates of nucleation, resulting in a more homogeneous mass distribution and a higher fractal dimension16.\n\nFig. 4: Global relationship between the box-counting fractal dimension (D box ) of polarized light microscopy images of CB samples and their corresponding melting temperature (T m ). Fractal dimension values plotted represent the means of six images, while melting temperature values plotted represent the means of three replicates. Full size image\n\nMechanical properties\n\nThe hardness of both CB and chocolate samples containing some of the minor components was determined by 3-point bending, and the elastic bending modulus calculated. The elastic bending moduli (E B ) of unrefined CB, refined CB, and DMPC CB are 44.1 \xc2\xb1 3.4, 35.4 \xc2\xb1 4.4, and 39.0 \xc2\xb1 3.7 N/mm2, respectively. There is no statistically significant difference between these values (P > 0.05). The melting temperatures for these samples are the same as well, with the average being 34.3 \xc2\xb1 0.1 \xc2\xb0C.\n\nFor the chocolate samples, the addition of phospholipids to molten commercial chocolate (90% cocoa solids) allows the chocolate to maintain hardness without complex tempering procedures, such as crystallization at 5 \xc2\xb0C for 1 h and subsequent storage at 20 \xc2\xb0C for 4 days. Other trials with static crystallization at 23 and 26 \xc2\xb0C yield chocolates with undesirable mechanical and surface properties, suggesting that the use of phospholipids to promote proper tempering still requires some optimization of crystallization temperatures. DMPC and DPPE were added chocolate at 0.1% (w/w) levels, and their properties were compared to commercial chocolate both directly from the package and recrystallized under the same conditions as the doped samples (Table 2). The E B is similar between the commercial chocolate and the phospholipid-containing samples, but is significantly lower for the recrystallized commercial chocolate (P < 0.05). When the chocolate is melted and recrystallized without any additive addition, it becomes much softer. A greater E B indicates a stiffer chocolate, relating to the property of snap, which is desirable in chocolate. However, DSC analysis revealed that all the chocolate samples have similar melting temperatures, all indicative of Form V CB crystals. XRD patterns further confirm the presence of Form V CB crystals in all samples (Fig. 5). Thus, it appears that the polymorphism of CB in chocolate does not wholly determine its mechanical properties, and these mechanical properties may be attributed to the microstructure instead.\n\nTable 2 Elastic bending modulus (E B ), melting temperature, and whiteness index (WI) of commercial chocolate samples with added phospholipids. Full size table\n\nFig. 5: Powder X-ray diffraction patterns for commercial chocolate with added minor lipidic components. Chocolate samples were molten, blended with the minor components and crystallized at 5 \xc2\xb0C for 1 h, followed by 20 \xc2\xb0C for 4 days. The a commercial chocolate, b molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate, c molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added 0.1% (w/w) dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, and d molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added 0.1% (w/w) dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine, all display powder X-ray diffraction patterns characteristic of well-tempered \xce\xb2 2 , triclinic, Form V cocoa butter crystals. This crystal form displays a strong reflection corresponding to a short spacing of ~4.6 \xc3\x85 in the wide-angle diffraction region, and characteristic wide-angle reflections in the 2\xce\xb8 region 20\xe2\x80\x9325\xc2\xb0. In the small-angle diffraction region, only reflections from the 3 L (001) plane corresponding to ~62\xe2\x80\x9363-\xc3\x85 were observed. The absence of reflections from (001) plane of the 2 L polytype indicates the formation of the optimal polytypic form in the cocoa butter in all samples. Reflections at higher angles in the small-angle region correspond to higher-order reflections for these two crystal planes. Full size image\n\nProper chocolate tempering typically focuses on the melting behavior of the chocolate, in other words, the polymorphism of the chocolate\xe2\x80\x99s CB triacylglycerol crystals2,3. However, there is little consideration for the microstructure and mechanical properties when determining whether chocolate has been properly tempered or not. Here we show that addition of DMPC and DPPE helps achieve the desired hardness and fracture properties in chocolate, without directly impacting the polymorphism. This likely results from changes in the microstructure of the underlying CB fat crystal network, which arises from the phospholipids affecting the nucleation behavior of the CB.\n\nSurface reflectance\n\nProper tempering of chocolate results in a smooth surface with high surface gloss17. Bloom, for example, is often characterized by the appearance of a grayish white film on the surface of chocolate, attributed to the uncontrolled polymorphic transformation from Form V to Form VI18. This white appearance is due to the presence of large surface crystals, which scatter light impinging upon them19. This can be quantified using the Whiteness Index (WI), calculated from RGB surface color measurements17. A higher WI indicates a greater level of fat bloom on the surface of the chocolate, or may also indicate a rougher surface. The WI for each of the chocolate samples is shown in Table 2. The commercial chocolate and the DMPC chocolate sample have similar WI, suggesting a properly tempered chocolate for the DMPC sample. Moreover, a statistically significant difference is evident between the DMPC chocolate sample and the recrystallized commercial chocolate sample (P < 0.05), which was not tempered properly. The lower WI of the DMPC chocolate sample suggests that the addition of this phospholipid aided in the stability of the chocolate, resulting in less fat bloom and/or a smoother surface compared to the recrystallized commercial chocolate sample. The effect of DPPE addition to molten and recrystallized chocolate is not as clear since the WI is not statistically different from the commercial, DMPC or molten and recrystallized chocolates.\n\nChocolate microstructure by synchrotron-based micro-computed tomography (SR-\xc2\xb5CT)\n\nSynchrotron \xc2\xb5CT analysis revealed similarities between chocolate microstructure among all samples imaged at a <450 \xc2\xb5m length scale. CT voxel intensity is directly proportional to material density. The number of voxels with a given intensity is then representative of the number of volume fractions with a given density in the analyzed volume. The molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate sample (Lindt-R) displays the largest difference between samples, with a narrowing and shift of the histogram compared to the fresh commercial chocolate (Lindt-F), molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added DMPC, and molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added DPPE. This indicates a difference in material structure upon recrystallization. This is visually represented in volume renderings where the most notable difference is a reduction in the green intensity for Lindt-R, compared to the Lindt-F, DMPC, and DPPE samples, as seen in Fig. 6. Volume rendering movies of each sample can be seen in the corresponding links in Fig. 6.\n\nFig. 6: Volume renderings of reconstructed slices, plotted histograms, and correlation matrix of SR-\xc2\xb5CT data. Samples included a molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added 0.1% (w/w) dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC), Supplementary Movie 1; b molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added 0.1% (w/w) dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DPPE), Supplementary Movie 2; c fresh commercial chocolate (Lindt-F), Supplementary Movie 3; d molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate (Lindt-R), Supplementary Movie 4; e plotted histograms, and f correlation matrix. Full size image\n\nA comparison of the histograms shows qualitative differences in the overall density distributions, which make up the sample volumes in the images. A correlation matrix was generated by inputting the voxel count values for each binned 16-bit gray-value and generating a table of correlation coefficients between the four chocolates density distributions. The correlation matrices show a high positive correlation in the material\xe2\x80\x99s density distribution regardless of treatment; however, the least variance is observed between DMPC vs. Lindt-F and DPPE vs. Lindt-F. The highest correlation coefficient is found between DMPC and fresh Lindt, and DPPE vs. fresh Lindt samples, with a value of 0.9987. This suggests that the complex microstructure of Lindt chocolate with added DMPC and DPPE and crystallized isothermally, is more similar to that of tempered fresh Lindt chocolate than without these additives.\n\nOverall, we find that the presence of various minor components within CB results in major changes to its polymorphism, crystallization kinetics, and crystal morphology. By refining CB through neutralization and bleaching, the unrefined CB transitioned from Form VI to a blend of Forms IV and V, in addition to displaying faster crystal growth. Although adding MAGs and FFAs back into refined CB results in some small differences, phospholipid addition has the largest impact.\n\nAt 0.1% (w/w) levels, DMPC and DPPE both significantly increase the crystal growth rate of refined CB. However, the DPPE sample exhibits significant amounts of the 2 L polytype, while the DMPC sample only displays 3 L polytypism, which is the more stable and preferred nanostructure. When added to a commercial chocolate sample, DMPC and DPPE both template the Form V polymorph with optimal mechanical properties, surface gloss and microstructure. This may allow for the production of chocolate products without the need for laborious and complex tempering protocols.\n\nProper tempering is often judged by the resulting melting temperature, a function of the CB polymorphic form2. However, as we show in this study, the various chocolate samples were all in Form V as determined by DSC and XRD analysis, but display different mechanical properties. This suggests that there is more to tempering than achieving the Form V polymorph, and important qualities such as gloss and snap may be heavily dependent on surface and bulk microstructure. Thus, DMPC, DPPE, and possibly other saturated phospholipids can potentially be employed as effective additives for engineering the crystallization behavior, polymorphism, nanostructure, and microstructure in CB and chocolate products.'";"Other";"258.txt-Other"

"267.txt";"b'Is chocolate toxic to dogs?\n\nYes, chocolate is toxic to dogs. While rarely fatal, chocolate ingestion can result in significant illness. Chocolate is toxic because it contains a chemical called theobromine, as well as caffeine. Theobromine is the main toxin in chocolate and is very similar to caffeine. Both chemicals are used medicinally as a diuretic, heart stimulant, blood vessel dilator, and a smooth muscle relaxant. Dogs cannot metabolize theobromine and caffeine as well as people can. That is why dogs are more sensitive to the chemicals\xe2\x80\x99 effects.\n\nHow much chocolate is poisonous to a dog?\n\nThe amount of toxic theobromine varies with the type of chocolate. The darker and more bitter the chocolate, the more dangerous it is to dogs. Baking chocolate and gourmet dark chocolate are highly concentrated and contain 130-450 mg of theobromine per ounce. Common milk chocolate only contains about 44-58 mg/ounce. White chocolate rarely poses any threat of chocolate poisoning with only 0.25 mg of theobromine per ounce of chocolate. Even if the amount ingested is not a toxicity concern, dogs can still become ill from the fat and sugar in chocolate. These can cause pancreatitis in severe cases or in dogs that have more sensitive stomachs. To put this in perspective, a medium-sized dog weighing 50 pounds would only need to eat 1 ounce of baker\'s chocolate, or 9 ounces of milk chocolate, to potentially show signs of poisoning. For many dogs, ingesting small amounts of milk chocolate is not harmful.\n\nWhat are the clinical signs of chocolate poisoning?\n\nClinical signs depend on the amount and type of chocolate ingested. For many dogs, the most common clinical signs are vomiting, diarrhea, increased thirst, panting or restlessness, excessive urination, and racing heart rate. In severe cases, symptoms can include muscle tremors, seizures, and heart failure. Complications such as developing aspiration pneumonia from vomiting, can make the prognosis for chocolate poisoning worse. When in doubt, immediate treatment by your veterinarian is recommended if a poisonous amount of chocolate is ingested.\n\n""Clinical signs of chocolate poisoning can take hours to develop and last for days.""\n\nClinical signs of chocolate poisoning can take several hours to develop. Signs due to large exposures can last for days due to the long half-life of theobromine. This means that it remains in the bloodstream for a longer period. Theobromine may be re-absorbed from the bladder, so intravenous fluids and frequent walks to encourage urination may be necessary. It is important to seek medical attention by calling your veterinarian or Pet Poison Helpline as soon as you suspect that your dog has eaten chocolate.\n\nWhat should I do if my dog eats chocolate?\n\nContact your veterinarian or Pet Poison Helpline to see if a poisonous amount of chocolate was ingested. If a toxic amount is ingested, you should have your dog examined by a veterinarian immediately. The sooner treatment begins, the better your dog\'s prognosis.\n\nWhat is the treatment for chocolate poisoning?\n\nTreatment depends on the amount and type of chocolate eaten. If treated early, decontamination including inducing vomiting and administering activated charcoal to prevent absorption of theobromine into the body may be all that is necessary. Treatments of activated charcoal may be repeated to reduce the continued resorption and recirculation of theobromine.\n\nIt is very common to provide supportive treatments such as intravenous fluid therapy to help stabilize a dog and promote theobromine excretion. All dogs ingesting a toxic amount of chocolate should be closely monitored for any signs of agitation, vomiting, diarrhea, nervousness, irregular heart rhythm, and high blood pressure. Medication to treat restlessness and other signs may also be necessary\n\nI saw a treat made for dogs that contains chocolate. Isn\'t this dangerous?\n\nMany gourmet dog treats use carob as a chocolate substitute.\n\n""Carob looks similar to chocolate and the two are often confused.""\n\nCarob looks similar to chocolate and the two are often confused. Some specialty dog bakeries will use a small amount of milk chocolate in treats. Since the amount of theobromine is typically low, this may be safe for most dogs. However, most veterinarians recommend that you avoid giving your dog chocolate in any form.\n\nPet Poison Helpline, an animal poison control center based out of Minneapolis, MN is available 24/7 for pet owners and veterinary professionals that require assistance treating a potentially poisoned pet. The staff provides treatment advice for poisoning cases of all species, including dogs, cats, birds, small mammals, large animals and exotic species.

"289.txt";"b'Chocolate is toxic to dogs, and depending on the type and amount of chocolate consumed and the weight of your dog, it could cause a serious medical emergency. If you know your dog has eaten chocolate, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to monitor him for signs of toxicity (see below), and it\xe2\x80\x99s recommended that you contact your veterinarian or the Pet Poison Helpline (855-213-6680, fee applies) for advice.\n\nLearn how much is too much, which types of chocolate are the most dangerous, and what signs to look for that may signal your dog needs treatment.\n\nWhy Chocolate Is Toxic to Dogs\n\nChocolate contains both theobromine and caffeine, both of which can speed the heart rate and stimulate the nervous system of dogs, the Merck/Merial Manual for Veterinary Health explains. The risk of your dog becoming sick from ingesting chocolate depends on the type and amount of chocolate consumed and the weight of the dog (calculate your dog\xe2\x80\x99s risk of toxicity with this easy-to-use program). The concentrations of these toxic substances vary among different types of chocolates. Here are a few types of chocolate listed in order of theobromine content:\n\nCocoa powder (most toxic) Unsweetened baker\xe2\x80\x99s chocolate Semisweet chocolate Dark chocolate Milk chocolate\n\nKnowing how much and what kind of chocolate your dog ate can help you and your vet determine if you have an emergency. In general, mild symptoms of chocolate toxicity occur when a dog consumes 20 mg of methylxanthines per kilogram of body weight. Cardiac symptoms of chocolate toxicity occur around 40 to 50 mg/kg, and seizures occur at dosages greater than 60 mg/kg.\n\nIn simpler terms, that means a very concerning dose of chocolate is approximately one ounce of milk chocolate per pound of body weight. Since an average Hershey\xe2\x80\x99s Milk Chocolate bar is 1.55 ounces, consuming even one chocolate bar can have serious consequences, especially for small dogs. Eating a crumb of chocolate cake or a very small piece of a chocolate bar, on the other hand, probably won\xe2\x80\x99t kill your dog, especially if it is a larger breed, but chocolate should never be fed as a treat.\n\nWhat are the Signs of Chocolate Poisoning?\n\nSigns of chocolate poisoning usually appear within 6 to 12 hours after your dog has eaten it, may last up to 72 hours, and include the following:\n\nVomiting\n\nDiarrhea\n\nRestlessness\n\nIncreased urination\n\nTremors\n\nElevated or abnormal heart rate\n\nSeizures\n\nCollapse and death\n\nNote: Older dogs and dogs with heart conditions are more at risk of sudden death from chocolate poisoning.\n\nWhat to Do If Your Dog Ate Chocolate\n\nIf you believe your dog ate chocolate, call your veterinarian immediately or call the Pet Poison Helpline (855-213-6680) for advice. Based on your dog\xe2\x80\x99s size and the amount and type of chocolate consumed, your veterinarian may recommend that you monitor your dog for the clinical signs listed above and call back if his condition worsens.\n\nIn other cases, the veterinarian may prefer you bring the dog into the clinic. If your pet consumed the chocolate less than two hours ago, your veterinarian may induce vomiting and give him several doses of activated charcoal, which works to move the toxins out of the body without being absorbed into the bloodstream. For more severe cases, veterinary intervention may be needed to provide supplemental treatment, such as medications or IV fluids, to resolve the effects of the poisoning. Dogs suffering from seizures may need to be monitored at the clinic overnight.\n\nHow to Prevent Your Dog from Eating Chocolate\n\nEven though small amounts of milk chocolate may not cause a problem in larger dogs, it\xe2\x80\x99s still not recommended that pet owners offer their dog chocolate as a treat. To prevent your dog from sneaking chocolate, follow these tips:\n\nPut it away: Make sure all chocolate items, including cocoa powder and hot chocolate mix, are stored where the dog cannot reach them, such as on a high shelf in a closed-door pantry. Remind your children and guests that chocolate should be kept out of the dog\xe2\x80\x99s reach and not left on countertops, tables, or in purses. Keep this in mind during the holidays, too, making sure to place trick-or-treat bags, Easter baskets, Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day candy, Christmas stockings, and Hanukkah coins (gelt), for example, in a place where a dog cannot get to them.\n\nTeach \xe2\x80\x9cleave it\xe2\x80\x9d: The command \xe2\x80\x9cleave it\xe2\x80\x9d is extremely effective in preventing dogs from eating something that falls onto the ground or is left within reach during a walk. It\xe2\x80\x99s also a very easy command to teach.\n\nCrate train your dog: The safest way to ensure your dog doesn\xe2\x80\x99t eat anything harmful while you\xe2\x80\x99re not supervising him is to crate train him. Find a sturdy crate that is large enough for your dog to stand up and turn around and make it a comfortable, safe place for him to retreat to when he wants to be alone or when you can\xe2\x80\x99t watch him.

"291.txt";"b""Many home chefs know that tempering chocolate to achieve a perfect finish and a satisfying 'snap' is no easy feat. Small variations in the quality of ingredients, temperature, mixing and timing can all set you up to fail, even when you learn from the best.\n\nThe results of a new study by food scientists from the University of Guelph in Canada suggest the addition of two common, naturally occurring fats \xe2\x80\x93 in the right proportions \xe2\x80\x93 might make chocolate tempering less of a gamble.\n\nPick up just about any block of milk chocolate from your local store, and you'll find it's more or less made out of the same things \xe2\x80\x93 cocoa butter for the form, cocoa mass (or chocolate liquor) for that familiar bitter taste, and additives like sugar or vanilla for sweetness and flavor.\n\nCrafting a solid bar of chocolate is a matter of encouraging the right size and distribution of crystals. In chocolate, crystalline forms of cocoa butter triglycerides (TAGs) are what give the food its characteristic shine, smooth texture, brittleness, and melting point.\n\nNot just any crystalline structure will do, either. Of the six distinct configurations of this class of molecule known to exist, Form V is the one that gives us a perfect temper.\n\nTempering \xe2\x80\x93 transforming the diverse mix of molecules into something that resists your bite while feeling heavenly smooth on your tongue \xe2\x80\x93 is a culinary process that has been gradually perfected over time, relying on a fine-tuned sequence of heating, mixing, and cooling.\n\nWhile researchers have investigated the influence TAG composition has on the success of tempering, little is known about how minor components of cocoa butter might make or break the process, including things like free fatty acids and phospholipids.\n\nGiven they make up just a few percent of the chemicals in cocoa butter, differences in their origins and refining might significantly alter the make-up of this key ingredient, either by helping the right crystals generate or interfering with their growth.\n\nPrevious research hinted at roles certain minor components had in the formation of the 'seed' crystals. For example, having a lot of free fatty acids seems to poison the crystallization process. Phospholipids, on the other hand, appeared to help them grow.\n\nTo nail down the precise proportions and chemical nature of these components, the researchers analyzed the exact make-up of a sample of cocoa butter, varying its composition by adding ingredients or bleaching out existing ones.\n\nThey then subjected it to a variety of tests to determine how variations in fat content might affect the growth time and proportion of crystal types, as well as things like melting point, surface reflection, micro-structure, and flex.\n\nWhile the amount of molecules such as free fatty acids had some effect, the real game-changer was the proportion of phospholipids, specifically saturated phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. Don't let the tongue-twister names fool you, though: these are garden variety biological molecules found in the membranes of living cells.\n\nBoth of these molecules in higher concentrations saw to the formation of Form V crystals, giving the cocoa butter the optimal glass, micro-structure, and mechanical properties.\n\nAdding the right amount of each to chocolate just might take the anxiety out of the tempering process, either by simplifying it or even eliminating it altogether.\n\nThis won't necessarily turn all of us into home kitchen dessertiers. But for professionals relying on recipes they can count on, knowing a little more about the chemistry of their chocolate creations just might give them the formula they need.\n\nThis research was published in Nature Communications.""";"Other";"291.txt-Other"

I had been wanting something sweet and since it was so hot outside, I decided I wanted ice cream. At the store, I saw the talenti pints of gelato and thought, ""how cute, I can reuse these."" I chose the coffee chocolate chip and I\'m so glad I did. It is creamy, has a full coffee flavor, and the chips are so thin and small they just melt away. I normally dislike chips in my frozen treats, but like I said, these just melted away nicely. My husband chose a the Belgian chocolate flavor and we were both disappointed with it compared to the coffee one. I ended up having to share mine with him which was fine since it is so rich I could only eat a little at a time.\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by DoctorEsq from Outstanding I have never been a coffee lover. Yes, in today\'s coffee addicted world that\'s strange but there you have it. I am, however, a tried and true Chocoholic. Yet the way Talenti has blended traditional coffee flavor with chocolate chips is truly outstanding. And the texture is perfect ~ a bit more solid then the other chocolate chip flavors especially in contrast to the Mediterranean Mint, Chocolate Chip, Peppermint Bark, etc ~ although all yummy, they melt far to quickly for my taste as I enjoy savoring the experience!! True, I pretty much love just about all the Talenti flavors and eat 1/2 a pint every night for my treat. But Talenti\'s Coffee Chocolate Chip has become one of my favorite flavors!\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by Auditory from This is what coffee flavor is all about In the mid-1960s when I was just a tot, my Sisters used to take me to a little shack that doubled as an ice cream parlor. The place featured a big name ice cream brand that is still one of the major players today. That\'s where I had my first taste of a coffee flavored frozen confection. Regrettably, the band name product today tastes nothing like I remembered it to have been. Fortunately, Talenti gelato has made that memory come back to life. With every spoonful, there is no guessing where the flavor is. Talenti has crafted a frozen dessert with an uncompromisingly strong coffee flavor that punches the tastebuds every time.\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by Kath12 from Delicious! My favorite ice cream flavor since I was young was Mocha. That flavor has disappeared. One night my daughter brought over brownies with a complimentary Talenti flavor. I fell in love with this gelato. Next time I went shopping I decided to buy the coffee with the chocolate chips. The first spoonful brought back the flavor I had longer for. It is now my nightly treat. All I need is 2-3 tablespoons full and I am totally satisfied until the next night. Sometimes I will mix it with one of your vanilla flavors & it is so yummy! No longer am I searching for this delicious flavor. I am totally hooked on Talenti brand gelato. I have enjoyed every flavor so far & I still have many more to try.\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by Baddie13 from Great Ice Cream This ice cream is delicious and is a great blend. I can taste the coffee and chocolate chips great together.\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by Mina from My life is now complete I was having a miserable day and I saw this in the store. Not much of a coffee person unless it\'s loaded with chocolate. Tried this as one of those what-the-hey-I\'ll-give-it-a-try moments and that first taste? [Insert angels singing here] DE-LOVIN-LICIOUS!!! The perfect amount of coffee taste, a ton of chocolate chips so no spoonful is left wanting, and my day got infinitely better after I downed half the jar in five minutes. Perfection in a jar. My only problem is trying to make it last before I can buy more! Yum yum yummy yummy yum! :D\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by best one so far from Best one so far Previous flavors I tried were super hard to open because they spilled gelato on the edge, making it extremely difficult to open. These were finally clean so it was easy to open. That was the first major PLUS in my book. Then I tried the gelato and was so impressed. It\'s the best coffee flavor I\'ve ever tasted. It\'s bolder than any other coffee flavored brands I\'ve tried so far. Normally I don\'t like ""stuff"" in my ice cream/gelato, but the ""chips"" in this one is more like shavings so it\'s not as noticeable (unlike their Double Dark Chocolate gelato which has chucks of chips). Best flavor so far from Talenti.'";"Other";"292.txt-Other"

"30.txt";"b""Originally consumed as a bitter drink, it was prized as both an aphrodisiac and an energy booster.\n\nMankind\xe2\x80\x99s love affair with chocolate stretches back more than five millennia. Produced from the seeds of tropical cacao trees native to the rainforests of Central and South America, chocolate was long considered the \xe2\x80\x9cfood of the gods,\xe2\x80\x9d and later, a delicacy for the elite. But for most of its history, it was actually consumed as a bitter beverage rather than the sweet, edible treat it has become worldwide.\n\nWhat Is the Birthplace of Chocolate?\n\nMayan cacao drink Ren Photo/Getty Images\n\nArchaeologists have discovered the earliest traces of cacao in pottery used by the ancient Mayo-Chinchipe culture 5,300 years ago in the upper Amazon region of Ecuador. Chocolate played an important political, spiritual and economic role in ancient Mesoamerican civilizations, which ground roasted cacao beans into a paste that they mixed with water, vanilla, chili peppers and other spices to brew a frothy chocolate drink.\n\nAncient Mesoamericans believed chocolate was an energy booster and aphrodisiac with mystical and medicinal qualities. The Mayans, who considered cacao a gift from the gods, used chocolate for sacred ceremonies and funeral offerings. Wealthy Mayans drank foaming chocolate drinks, while commoners consumed chocolate in a cold porridge-like dish.\n\nAs people of the Aztec empire spread across Mesoamerica in the 1400s, they too began to prize cacao. Since they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t grow it in the dry highlands of central Mexico, they traded with the Mayans for the beans, which they even used as currency. (In the 1500s, Aztecs could purchase a turkey hen or a hare for 100 beans.) By one account, the 16th-century Aztec ruler Moctezuma II drank 50 cups of chocolate a day out of a golden goblet to increase his libido.\n\nWATCH: Season 1 of The Food That Built America without signing in now.\n\nSpaniards Introduce Chocolate to Europe\xe2\x80\x99s Elite\n\nChocolate arrived in Europe during the 1500s, likely brought by both Spanish friars and conquistadors who had traveled to the Americas. Although the Spanish sweetened the bitter drink with cane sugar and cinnamon, one thing remained unchanged: Chocolate reigned as a delectable symbol of luxury, wealth and power\xe2\x80\x94an expensive import sipped by royal lips, and affordable only to Spanish elites.\n\nChocolate\xe2\x80\x99s popularity eventually spread to other European courts, where aristocrats consumed it as a magic elixir with health benefits. To slake their growing thirst for chocolate, European powers established colonial plantations in equatorial regions around the world to grow cacao and sugar. When diseases brought by Europeans depleted the native Mesoamerican labor pool, African slaves were imported to the Americas to work on the plantations and maintain chocolate production.\n\nChocolate remained an aristocratic nectar until the 1828 invention of the cocoa press revolutionized its production. Attributed in varying accounts to either Dutch chemist Coenraad Johannes van Houten or his father, Casparus, the cocoa press squeezed the fatty butter from roasted cacao beans, leaving behind a dry cake that could be pulverized into a fine powder that could be mixed with liquids and other ingredients, poured into molds and solidified into edible, easily digestible chocolate. The cocoa press ushered in the modern era of chocolate by enabling it to be used as a confectionary ingredient, and the resulting drop in production costs made chocolate much more affordable.\n\nREAD MORE: Why the Candy Bar Market Exploded After WWI\n\nChocolate Becomes a Treat for the Masses\n\n10 Gallery 10 Images\n\nIn 1847, British chocolate company J.S. Fry & Sons created the first edible chocolate bar from cocoa butter, cocoa powder and sugar. Rival chocolatier Cadbury\xe2\x80\x99s, credited with pioneering the Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day chocolate box and chocolate Easter egg, followed suit soon after and in 1854 earned a royal warrant as purveyors of chocolate to Queen Victoria.\n\nIt was in Switzerland that chocolate production took one of its greatest leaps forward. In the 1870s, Swiss chocolatier Daniel Peter utilized a powdered milk developed several years earlier by his neighbor Henri Nestl\xc3\xa9 to produce the first milk chocolate bar, and the pair eventually formed the Nestl\xc3\xa9 Company. Swiss chocolatier Rodolphe Lindt\xe2\x80\x99s 1879 invention of the conching machine\xe2\x80\x94which used large stone rollers to mix and aerate chocolate to give it a velvety texture and superior taste\xe2\x80\x94allowed for the mass production of smooth, creamy milk chocolate.\n\nIn the United States, Milton Hershey pioneered the assembly-line production of milk chocolate. After selling his caramel candy company for $1 million and producing his first milk chocolate bar in 1900, Hershey bought farmland near his birthplace in rural Pennsylvania and built an entire factory town devoted to chocolate. The grass-fed Holsteins on the surrounding dairy farms supplied the company\xe2\x80\x99s milk, and a company town in Cuba supplied its sugar.\n\nREAD MORE: How Hershey's Chocolate Helped Power Allied Troops in WWII\n\nChocolate bars soared in popularity during the Roaring Twenties. By the end of the decade, more than 40,000 different candy bars were being made in the U.S., according to Susan Benjamin, candy historian and author of Sweet as Sin: The Unwrapped Story of How Candy Became America\xe2\x80\x99s Favorite Pleasure. Father-and-son duo Frank C. Mars and Forrest Mars Sr. collaborated on the idea for the Milky Way bar, which hit the market in 1923 with the chocolate for its coating supplied by Hershey\xe2\x80\x99s. The family-owned business would rival Hershey\xe2\x80\x99s, and Forrest Mars Sr. later partnered with the son of a Hershey\xe2\x80\x99s executive to begin production of M&M candies in 1941.\n\nH.B. Reese, who had worked as a dairy farmer and shipping foreman for Hershey\xe2\x80\x99s, launched his own candy company in 1923 and five years later introduced Reese\xe2\x80\x99s Peanut Butter Cups. They later came to be produced by Hershey\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94and one of the top-selling candies in the United States.\n\nFrom its roots more than 5,000 years ago, chocolate has become a big business. According to research by Statista, retail sales of chocolate worldwide in 2016 totaled nearly $100 billion, including almost $25 billion in the United States alone. While the cacao plant is native to the Americas, its cultivation has now shifted to Africa, which is now the source of more than two-thirds of worldwide cocoa production.\n\nWATCH: Full episodes of The Food That Built America online now.""";"Other";"30.txt-Other"
"301.txt";"b'Food produced from the seed of Theobroma cacao\n\nChocolate is a food product made from roasted and ground cacao pods, that is available as a liquid, solid or paste, on its own or as a flavoring agent in other foods. Cacao has been consumed in some form since at least the Olmec civilization (19th-11th century BCE),[1][2] and the majority of Mesoamerican people - including the Maya and Aztecs - made chocolate beverages.[3]\n\nThe seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor. After fermentation, the beans are dried, cleaned, and roasted. The shell is removed to produce cocoa nibs, which are then ground to cocoa mass, unadulterated chocolate in rough form. Once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating, it is called chocolate liquor. The liquor may also be cooled and processed into its two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter. Baking chocolate, also called bitter chocolate, contains cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions, without any added sugar. Powdered baking cocoa, which contains more fiber than cocoa butter, can be processed with alkali to produce dutch cocoa. Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, a combination of cocoa solids, cocoa butter or added vegetable oils, and sugar. Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder or condensed milk. White chocolate contains cocoa butter, sugar, and milk, but no cocoa solids.\n\nChocolate is one of the most popular food types and flavors in the world, and many foodstuffs involving chocolate exist, particularly desserts, including cakes, pudding, mousse, chocolate brownies, and chocolate chip cookies. Many candies are filled with or coated with sweetened chocolate. Chocolate bars, either made of solid chocolate or other ingredients coated in chocolate, are eaten as snacks. Gifts of chocolate molded into different shapes (such as eggs, hearts, coins) are traditional on certain Western holidays, including Christmas, Easter, Valentine\'s Day, and Hanukkah. Chocolate is also used in cold and hot beverages, such as chocolate milk and hot chocolate, and in some alcoholic drinks, such as creme de cacao.\n\nAlthough cocoa originated in the Americas, West African countries, particularly C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire and Ghana, are the leading producers of cocoa in the 21st century, accounting for some 60% of the world cocoa supply.\n\nWith some two million children involved in the farming of cocoa in West Africa, child slavery and trafficking were major concerns in 2018,[4][5] and continue to be. International attempts to improve conditions for children were doomed to failure because of persistent poverty, absence of schools, increasing world cocoa demand, more intensive farming of cocoa, and continued exploitation of child labor.[4]\n\nHistory\n\nMesoamerican usage\n\nTwo Mayans sit around a container of frothed chocolate.\n\nChocolate has been prepared as a drink for nearly all of its history. For example, one vessel found at an Olmec archaeological site on the Gulf Coast of Veracruz, Mexico, dates chocolate\'s preparation by pre-Olmec peoples as early as 1750 BC.[6] On the Pacific coast of Chiapas, Mexico, a Mokaya archaeological site provides evidence of cocoa beverages dating even earlier, to 1900 BC.[7][6] The residues and the kind of vessel in which they were found indicate the initial use of cocoa was not simply as a beverage, but the white pulp around the cocoa beans was likely used as a source of fermentable sugars for an alcoholic drink.[8]\n\nMan Carrying a Cacao Pod, 1440\xe2\x80\x931521. Volcanic stone, traces of red pigment. Aztec., 1440\xe2\x80\x931521. Volcanic stone, traces of red pigment. Brooklyn Museum\n\nAn early Classic-period (460\xe2\x80\x93480 AD) Mayan tomb from the site in Rio Azul had vessels with the Maya glyph for cocoa on them with residue of a chocolate drink, suggests the Maya were drinking chocolate around 400 AD.[9] Documents in Maya hieroglyphs stated chocolate was used for ceremonial purposes, in addition to everyday life.[10] The Maya grew cacao trees in their backyards,[11] and used the cocoa seeds the trees produced to make a frothy, bitter drink.[12]\n\nBy the 15th century, the Aztecs gained control of a large part of Mesoamerica and adopted cocoa into their culture. They associated chocolate with Quetzalcoatl, who, according to one legend, was cast away by the other gods for sharing chocolate with humans,[13] and identified its extrication from the pod with the removal of the human heart in sacrifice.[14] In contrast to the Maya, who liked their chocolate warm, the Aztecs drank it cold, seasoning it with a broad variety of additives, including the petals of the Cymbopetalum penduliflorum tree, chile pepper, allspice, vanilla, and honey.\n\nThe Aztecs were unable to grow cocoa themselves, as their home in the Mexican highlands was unsuitable for it, so chocolate was a luxury imported into the empire.[13] Those who lived in areas ruled by the Aztecs were required to offer cocoa seeds in payment of the tax they deemed ""tribute"".[13] Cocoa beans were often used as currency.[15] For example, the Aztecs used a system in which one turkey cost 100 cocoa beans and one fresh avocado was worth three beans.[16]\n\nThe Maya and Aztecs associated cocoa with human sacrifice, and chocolate drinks specifically with sacrificial human blood. The Spanish royal chronicler Gonzalo Fern\xc3\xa1ndez de Oviedo y Vald\xc3\xa9s described a chocolate drink he had seen in Nicaragua in 1528, mixed with achiote: ""because those people are fond of drinking human blood, to make this beverage seem like blood, they add a little achiote, so that it then turns red. ... and part of that foam is left on the lips and around the mouth, and when it is red for having achiote, it seems a horrific thing, because it seems like blood itself.""\n\nEuropean adaptation\n\nThe morning chocolate by Chocolate soon became a fashionable drink of the European nobility after the discovery of the Americas.by Pietro Longhi ; Venice, 1775\xe2\x80\x931780\n\nUntil the 16th century, no European had ever heard of the popular drink from the Central American peoples.[13] Christopher Columbus and his son Ferdinand encountered the cocoa bean on Columbus\'s fourth mission to the Americas on 15 August 1502, when he and his crew seized a large native canoe that proved to contain cocoa beans among other goods for trade.[19] Spanish conquistador Hern\xc3\xa1n Cort\xc3\xa9s may have been the first European to encounter it, as the frothy drink was part of the after-dinner routine of Montezuma.[9][20] Jos\xc3\xa9 de Acosta, a Spanish Jesuit missionary who lived in Peru and then Mexico in the later 16th century, wrote of its growing influence on the Spaniards:\n\nAlthough bananas are more profitable, cocoa is more highly esteemed in Mexico. . . Cocoa is a smaller fruit than almonds and thicker, which toasted do not taste bad. It is so prized among the Indians and even among Spaniards. . . because since it is a dried fruit it can be stored for a long time without deterioration, and they brings ships loaded with them from the province of Guatemala. . . It also serves as currency, because with five cocoas you can buy one thing, with thirty another, and with a hundred something else, without there being contradiction; and they give these cocoas as alms to the poor who beg for them. The principal product of this cocoa is a concoction which they make that they call \xe2\x80\x9cchocolate,\xe2\x80\x9d which is a crazy thing treasured in that land, and those who are not accustomed are disgusted by it, because it has a foam on top and a bubbling like that of feces, which certainly takes a lot to put up with. Anyway, it is the prized beverage which the Indians offer to nobles who come to or pass through their lands; and the Spaniards, especially Spanish women born in those lands die for black chocolate. This aforementioned chocolate is said to the be made in various forms and temperaments, hot, cold, and lukewarm. They are wont to use spices and much chili; they also make it into a paste, and it is said that it is a medicine to treat coughs, the stomach, and colds. Whatever may be the case, in fact those who have not been reared on this opinion are not appetized by it.[21]\n\n""Trait\xc3\xa9s nouveaux & curieux du caf\xc3\xa9 du th\xc3\xa9 et du chocolate"", by Philippe Sylvestre Dufour, 1685 , by Philippe Sylvestre Dufour, 1685\n\nWhile Columbus had taken cocoa beans with him back to Spain,[19] chocolate made no impact until Spanish friars introduced it to the Spanish court.[13] After the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs, chocolate was imported to Europe. There, it quickly became a court favorite. It was still served as a beverage, but the Spanish added sugar, as well as honey (the original sweetener used by the Aztecs for chocolate), to counteract the natural bitterness.[22] Vanilla, another indigenous American introduction, was also a popular additive, with pepper and other spices sometimes used to give the illusion of a more potent vanilla flavor. Unfortunately, these spices tended to unsettle the European constitution; the Encyclop\xc3\xa9die states, ""The pleasant scent and sublime taste it imparts to chocolate have made it highly recommended; but a long experience having shown that it could potentially upset one\'s stomach"", which is why chocolate without vanilla was sometimes referred to as ""healthy chocolate"".[23] By 1602, chocolate had made its way from Spain to Austria.[24] By 1662, Pope Alexander VII had declared that religious fasts were not broken by consuming chocolate drinks. Within about a hundred years, chocolate established a foothold throughout Europe.[13]\n\nmoulinet or swizzle stick, London 1714\xe2\x80\x9315 ( Silver chocolate pot with hinged finial to insert aor swizzle stick, London 1714\xe2\x80\x9315 ( Victoria and Albert Museum\n\nThe new craze for chocolate brought with it a thriving slave market, as between the early 1600s and late 1800s, the laborious and slow processing of the cocoa bean was manual.[13] Cocoa plantations spread, as the English, Dutch, and French colonized and planted. With the depletion of Mesoamerican workers, largely to disease, cocoa production was often the work of poor wage laborers and African slaves. Wind-powered and horse-drawn mills were used to speed production, augmenting human labor. Heating the working areas of the table-mill, an innovation that emerged in France in 1732, also assisted in extraction.[25]\n\nNew processes that sped the production of chocolate emerged early in the Industrial Revolution. In 1815, Dutch chemist Coenraad van Houten introduced alkaline salts to chocolate, which reduced its bitterness.[13] A few years thereafter, in 1828, he created a press to remove about half the natural fat (cocoa butter or cocoa butter) from chocolate liquor, which made chocolate both cheaper to produce and more consistent in quality. This innovation introduced the modern era of chocolate.[19]\n\nKnown as ""Dutch cocoa"", this machine-pressed chocolate was instrumental in the transformation of chocolate to its solid form when, in 1847, English chocolatier Joseph Fry discovered a way to make chocolate moldable when he mixed the ingredients of cocoa powder and sugar with melted cocoa butter.[22] Subsequently, his chocolate factory, Fry\'s of Bristol, England, began mass-producing chocolate bars, Fry\'s Chocolate Cream, launched in 1866, and they became very popular.[26] Milk had sometimes been used as an addition to chocolate beverages since the mid-17th century, but in 1875 Swiss chocolatier Daniel Peter invented milk chocolate by mixing a powdered milk developed by Henri Nestl\xc3\xa9 with the liquor.[13][19] In 1879, the texture and taste of chocolate was further improved when Rudolphe Lindt invented the conching machine.[27]\n\nBesides Nestl\xc3\xa9, several notable chocolate companies had their start in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Rowntree\'s of York set up and began producing chocolate in 1862, after buying out the Tuke family business. Cadbury was manufacturing boxed chocolates in England by 1868.[13] Manufacturing their first Easter egg in 1875, Cadbury created the modern chocolate Easter egg after developing a pure cocoa butter that could easily be molded into smooth shapes.[28] In 1893, Milton S. Hershey purchased chocolate processing equipment at the World\'s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, and soon began the career of Hershey\'s chocolates with chocolate-coated caramels.\n\nIntroduction to the United States\n\nThe Baker Chocolate Company, which makes Baker\'s Chocolate, is the oldest producer of chocolate in the United States. In 1765 Dr. James Baker and John Hannon founded the company in Boston. Using cocoa beans from the West Indies, the pair built their chocolate business, which is still in operation.[29][30]\n\nWhite chocolate was first introduced to the U.S. in 1946 by Frederick E. Hebert of Hebert Candies in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, near Boston, after he had tasted ""white coat"" candies while traveling in Europe.[31][30]\n\nEtymology\n\nCocoa, pronounced by the Olmecs as kakawa,[1] dates to 1000 BC or earlier.[1] The word ""chocolate"" entered the English language from Spanish in about 1600.[32] The word entered Spanish from the word chocol\xc4\x81tl in Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs. The origin of the Nahuatl word is uncertain, as it does not appear in any early Nahuatl source, where the word for chocolate drink is cacahuatl, ""cocoa water"". It is possible that the Spaniards coined the word (perhaps in order to avoid caca, a vulgar Spanish word for ""faeces"") by combining the Yucatec Mayan word chocol, ""hot"", with the Nahuatl word atl, ""water"". A widely-cited proposal is that the derives from unattested xocolatl meaning ""bitter drink"" is unsupported; the change from x- to ch- is unexplained, as is the -l-. Another proposed etymology derives it from the word chicolatl, meaning ""beaten drink"", which may derive from the word for the frothing stick, chicoli.[34] Other scholars reject all these proposals, considering the origin of first element of the name to be unknown.[35] The term ""chocolatier"", for a chocolate confection maker, is attested from 1888.[36]\n\nTypes\n\nChocolate is commonly used as a coating for various fruits such as cherries and/or fillings, such as liqueurs\n\nSeveral types of chocolate can be distinguished. Pure, unsweetened chocolate, often called ""baking chocolate"", contains primarily cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions. Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, which combines chocolate with sugar.\n\nMilk\n\nMilk chocolate is sweet chocolate that also contains milk powder or condensed milk. In the UK and Ireland, milk chocolate must contain a minimum of 20% total dry cocoa solids; in the rest of the European Union, the minimum is 25%.[37]\n\nWhite\n\nWhite chocolate\n\nWhite chocolate, although similar in texture to that of milk and dark chocolate, does not contain any cocoa solids that impart a dark color. In 2002, the US Food and Drug Administration established a standard for white chocolate as the ""common or usual name of products made from cocoa fat (i.e., cocoa butter), milk solids, nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners, and other safe and suitable ingredients, but containing no nonfat cocoa solids"".[38]\n\nDark\n\nDark chocolate is produced by adding fat and sugar to the cocoa mixture. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration calls this ""sweet chocolate"", and requires a 15% concentration of chocolate liquor. European rules specify a minimum of 35% cocoa solids.[37] A higher amount of cocoa solids indicates more bitterness. Semisweet chocolate is dark chocolate with low sugar content. Bittersweet chocolate is chocolate liquor to which some sugar (typically a third), more cocoa butter and vanilla are added.[39] It has less sugar and more liquor than semisweet chocolate, but the two are interchangeable in baking. It is also known to last for two years if stored properly. As of 2017 , there is no high-quality evidence that dark chocolate affects blood pressure significantly or provides other health benefits.[40]\n\nUnsweetened\n\nUnsweetened chocolate is pure chocolate liquor, also known as bitter or baking chocolate. It is unadulterated chocolate: the pure, ground, roasted chocolate beans impart a strong, deep chocolate flavor. It is typically used in baking or other products to which sugar and other ingredients are added. Raw chocolate, often referred to as raw cocoa, is always dark and a minimum of 75% cocoa.\n\nUnsweetened ""Baking"" Chocolate\n\nPoorly tempered or untempered chocolate may have whitish spots on the dark chocolate part, called chocolate bloom; it is an indication that sugar or fat has separated due to poor storage. It is not toxic and can be safely consumed.[41]\n\nProduction\n\nChocolate is created from the cocoa bean. A cacao tree with fruit pods in various stages of ripening.\n\nRoughly two-thirds of the entire world\'s cocoa is produced in West Africa, with 43% sourced from C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire,[42] where, as of 2007 , child labor is a common practice to obtain the product.[43][44] According to the World Cocoa Foundation, in 2007 some 50 million people around the world depended on cocoa as a source of livelihood.[45] As of 2007 in the UK, most chocolatiers purchase their chocolate from them, to melt, mold and package to their own design.[46] According to the WCF\'s 2012 report, the Ivory Coast is the largest producer of cocoa in the world.[47] The two main jobs associated with creating chocolate candy are chocolate makers and chocolatiers. Chocolate makers use harvested cocoa beans and other ingredients to produce couverture chocolate (covering). Chocolatiers use the finished couverture to make chocolate candies (bars, truffles, etc.).[48]\n\nProduction costs can be decreased by reducing cocoa solids content or by substituting cocoa butter with another fat. Cocoa growers object to allowing the resulting food to be called ""chocolate"", due to the risk of lower demand for their crops.[45]\n\nGenome\n\nThe sequencing in 2010 of the genome of the cacao tree may allow yields to be improved.[49] Due to concerns about global warming effects on lowland climate in the narrow band of latitudes where cocoa is grown (20 degrees north and south of the equator), the commercial company Mars, Incorporated and the University of California, Berkeley are conducting genomic research in 2017\xe2\x80\x9318 to improve the survivability of cacao plants in hot climates.[50]\n\nCacao varieties\n\nChocolate is made from cocoa beans, the dried and fermented seeds of the cacao tree (Theobroma cacao), a small, 4\xe2\x80\x938 m tall (15\xe2\x80\x9326 ft tall) evergreen tree native to the deep tropical region of the Americas. Recent genetic studies suggest the most common genotype of the plant originated in the Amazon basin and was gradually transported by humans throughout South and Central America. Early forms of another genotype have also been found in what is now Venezuela. The scientific name, Theobroma, means ""food of the gods"".[51] The fruit, called a cocoa pod, is ovoid, 15\xe2\x80\x9330 cm (6\xe2\x80\x9312 in) long and 8\xe2\x80\x9310 cm (3\xe2\x80\x934 in) wide, ripening yellow to orange, and weighing about 500 g (1.1 lb) when ripe.\n\nCacao trees are small, understory trees that need rich, well-drained soils. They naturally grow within 20\xc2\xb0 of either side of the equator because they need about 2000 mm of rainfall a year, and temperatures in the range of 21 to 32 \xc2\xb0C (70 to 90 \xc2\xb0F). Cacao trees cannot tolerate a temperature lower than 15 \xc2\xb0C (59 \xc2\xb0F).[52]\n\nThe three main varieties of cocoa beans used in chocolate are criollo, forastero, and trinitario.\n\nCriollo\n\nRepresenting only 5% of all cocoa beans grown as of 2008 ,[53] criollo is the rarest and most expensive cocoa on the market, and is native to Central America, the Caribbean islands and the northern tier of South American states.[54] The genetic purity of cocoas sold today as criollo is disputed, as most populations have been exposed to the genetic influence of other varieties.\n\nCriollos are particularly difficult to grow, as they are vulnerable to a variety of environmental threats and produce low yields of cocoa per tree. The flavor of criollo is described as delicate yet complex, low in classic chocolate flavor, but rich in ""secondary"" notes of long duration.[55]\n\nForastero\n\nThe most commonly grown bean is forastero,[53] a large group of wild and cultivated cocoas, most likely native to the Amazon basin. The African cocoa crop is entirely made up of forastero. They are significantly hardier and of higher yield than criollo. The source of most chocolate marketed,[53] forastero cocoas are typically strong in classic ""chocolate"" flavor, but have a short duration and are unsupported by secondary flavors, producing ""quite bland"" chocolate.[53]\n\nTrinitario\n\nTrinitario is a natural hybrid of criollo and forastero. Trinitario originated in Trinidad after an introduction of forastero to the local criollo crop. Nearly all cocoa produced over the past five decades is of the forastero or lower-grade trinitario varieties.[56]\n\nProcessing\n\nCocoa pods are harvested by cutting them from the tree using a machete, or by knocking them off the tree using a stick. The beans with their surrounding pulp are removed from the pods and placed in piles or bins, allowing access to micro-organisms so fermentation of the pectin-containing material can begin. Yeasts produce ethanol, lactic acid bacteria produce lactic acid, and acetic acid bacteria produce acetic acid. The fermentation process, which takes up to seven days, also produces several flavor precursors, eventually resulting in the familiar chocolate taste.[57]\n\nIt is important to harvest the pods when they are fully ripe, because if the pod is unripe, the beans will have a low cocoa butter content, or sugars in the white pulp will be insufficient for fermentation, resulting in a weak flavor. After fermentation, the beans must be quickly dried to prevent mold growth. Climate and weather permitting, this is done by spreading the beans out in the sun from five to seven days.[58]\n\nThe dried beans are then transported to a chocolate manufacturing facility. The beans are cleaned (removing twigs, stones, and other debris), roasted, and graded. Next, the shell of each bean is removed to extract the nib. Finally, the nibs are ground and liquefied, resulting in pure chocolate in fluid form: chocolate liquor.[59] The liquor can be further processed into two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter.[60]\n\nBlending\n\nChocolate liquor is blended with the cocoa butter in varying quantities to make different types of chocolate or couverture. The basic blends of ingredients for the various types of chocolate (in order of highest quantity of cocoa liquor first), are:\n\nFountain chocolate is made with high levels of cocoa butter, allowing it to flow gently over a chocolate fountain to serve as dessert fondue\n\nDark chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa liquor, and (sometimes) vanilla\n\nMilk chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa liquor, milk or milk powder, and vanilla\n\nWhite chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, milk or milk powder, and vanilla\n\nUsually, an emulsifying agent, such as soy lecithin, is added, though a few manufacturers prefer to exclude this ingredient for purity reasons and to remain GMO-free, sometimes at the cost of a perfectly smooth texture. Some manufacturers are now using PGPR, an artificial emulsifier derived from castor oil that allows them to reduce the amount of cocoa butter while maintaining the same mouthfeel.\n\nThe texture is also heavily influenced by processing, specifically conching (see below). The more expensive chocolate tends to be processed longer and thus has a smoother texture and mouthfeel, regardless of whether emulsifying agents are added.\n\nDifferent manufacturers develop their own ""signature"" blends based on the above formulas, but varying proportions of the different constituents are used. The finest, plain dark chocolate couverture contains at least 70% cocoa (both solids and butter), whereas milk chocolate usually contains up to 50%. High-quality white chocolate couverture contains only about 35% cocoa butter.\n\nProducers of high-quality, small-batch chocolate argue that mass production produces bad-quality chocolate.[53] Some mass-produced chocolate contains much less cocoa (as low as 7% in many cases), and fats other than cocoa butter. Vegetable oils and artificial vanilla flavor are often used in cheaper chocolate to mask poorly fermented and/or roasted beans.[53]\n\nIn 2007, the Chocolate Manufacturers Association in the United States, whose members include Hershey, Nestl\xc3\xa9, and Archer Daniels Midland, lobbied the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to change the legal definition of chocolate to let them substitute partially hydrogenated vegetable oils for cocoa butter, in addition to using artificial sweeteners and milk substitutes.[61] Currently, the FDA does not allow a product to be referred to as ""chocolate"" if the product contains any of these ingredients.[62][63]\n\nIn the EU a product can be sold as chocolate if it contains up to 5% vegetable oil, and must be labeled as ""family milk chocolate"" rather than ""milk chocolate"" if it contains 20% milk.[64]\n\nAccording to Canadian Food and Drug Regulations,[65] a ""chocolate product"" is a food product that is sourced from at least one ""cocoa product"" and contains at least one of the following: ""chocolate, bittersweet chocolate, semi-sweet chocolate, dark chocolate, sweet chocolate, milk chocolate, or white chocolate"". A ""cocoa product"" is defined as a food product that is sourced from cocoa beans and contains ""cocoa nibs, cocoa liquor, cocoa mass, unsweetened chocolate, bitter chocolate, chocolate liquor, cocoa, low-fat cocoa, cocoa powder, or low-fat cocoa powder"".\n\nConching\n\nChocolate melanger mixing raw ingredients\n\nThe penultimate process is called conching. A conche is a container filled with metal beads, which act as grinders. The refined and blended chocolate mass is kept in a liquid state by frictional heat. Chocolate before conching has an uneven and gritty texture. The conching process produces cocoa and sugar particles smaller than the tongue can detect (typically around 20 \xce\xbcm) and reduces rough edges, hence the smooth feel in the mouth. The length of the conching process determines the final smoothness and quality of the chocolate. High-quality chocolate is conched for about 72 hours, and lesser grades about four to six hours. After the process is complete, the chocolate mass is stored in tanks heated to about 45 to 50 \xc2\xb0C (113 to 122 \xc2\xb0F) until final processing.[66]\n\nTempering\n\nVideo of cocoa beans being ground and mixed with other ingredients to make chocolate at a Mayordomo store in Oaxaca\n\nThe final process is called tempering. Uncontrolled crystallization of cocoa butter typically results in crystals of varying size, some or all large enough to be seen with the naked eye. This causes the surface of the chocolate to appear mottled and matte, and causes the chocolate to crumble rather than snap when broken.[67][68] The uniform sheen and crisp bite of properly processed chocolate are the results of consistently small cocoa butter crystals produced by the tempering process.\n\nThe fats in cocoa butter can crystallize in six different forms (polymorphous crystallization).[67][69] The primary purpose of tempering is to assure that only the best form is present. The six different crystal forms have different properties.\n\nCrystal Melting temp. Notes I 17 \xc2\xb0C (63 \xc2\xb0F) Soft, crumbly, melts too easily II 21 \xc2\xb0C (70 \xc2\xb0F) Soft, crumbly, melts too easily III 26 \xc2\xb0C (79 \xc2\xb0F) Firm, poor snap, melts too easily IV 28 \xc2\xb0C (82 \xc2\xb0F) Firm, good snap, melts too easily V 34 \xc2\xb0C (93 \xc2\xb0F) Glossy, firm, best snap, melts near body temperature (37 \xc2\xb0C) VI 36 \xc2\xb0C (97 \xc2\xb0F) Hard, takes weeks to form\n\nMolten chocolate and a piece of a chocolate bar\n\nAs a solid piece of chocolate, the cocoa butter fat particles are in a crystalline rigid structure that gives the chocolate its solid appearance. Once heated, the crystals of the polymorphic cocoa butter can break apart from the rigid structure and allow the chocolate to obtain a more fluid consistency as the temperature increases \xe2\x80\x93 the melting process. When the heat is removed, the cocoa butter crystals become rigid again and come closer together, allowing the chocolate to solidify.[70]\n\nThe temperature in which the crystals obtain enough energy to break apart from their rigid conformation would depend on the milk fat content in the chocolate and the shape of the fat molecules, as well as the form of the cocoa butterfat. Chocolate with a higher fat content will melt at a lower temperature.[71]\n\nMaking chocolate considered ""good"" is about forming as many type V crystals as possible. This provides the best appearance and texture and creates the most stable crystals, so the texture and appearance will not degrade over time. To accomplish this, the temperature is carefully manipulated during the crystallization.\n\npistoles and callets Chocolate cubes,and\n\nGenerally, the chocolate is first heated to 45 \xc2\xb0C (113 \xc2\xb0F) to melt all six forms of crystals.[67][69] Next, the chocolate is cooled to about 27 \xc2\xb0C (81 \xc2\xb0F), which will allow crystal types IV and V to form. At this temperature, the chocolate is agitated to create many small crystal ""seeds"" which will serve as nuclei to create small crystals in the chocolate. The chocolate is then heated to about 31 \xc2\xb0C (88 \xc2\xb0F) to eliminate any type IV crystals, leaving just type V. After this point, any excessive heating of the chocolate will destroy the temper and this process will have to be repeated. Other methods of chocolate tempering are used as well. The most common variant is introducing already tempered, solid ""seed"" chocolate. The temper of chocolate can be measured with a chocolate temper meter to ensure accuracy and consistency. A sample cup is filled with the chocolate and placed in the unit which then displays or prints the results.\n\nTwo classic ways of manually tempering chocolate are:\n\nWorking the molten chocolate on a heat-absorbing surface, such as a stone slab, until thickening indicates the presence of sufficient crystal ""seeds""; the chocolate is then gently warmed to working temperature.\n\nStirring solid chocolate into molten chocolate to ""inoculate"" the liquid chocolate with crystals (this method uses the already formed crystals of the solid chocolate to ""seed"" the molten chocolate).\n\nChocolate tempering machines (or temperers) with computer controls can be used for producing consistently tempered chocolate. In particular, continuous tempering machines are used in large volume applications. Various methods and apparatuses for continuous flow tempering have been described by Aasted, Sollich and Buhler, three manufacturers of commercial chocolate equipment, with a focus now on energy efficiency. In general, molten chocolate coming in at 40\xe2\x80\x9350 \xc2\xb0C is cooled in heat exchangers to crystallization temperates of about 26\xe2\x80\x9330 \xc2\xb0C, passed through a tempering column consisting of spinning plates to induce shear, then warmed slightly to re-melt undesirable crystal formations.[72][73]\n\nShaping\n\nChocolate is molded in different shapes for different uses:[74]\n\nChocolate bars (tablets) are rectangular blocks of chocolate meant to be broken down to cubes (or other predefined shapes), which can then be used for consumption, cooking and baking. The term is also used for combination bars, which are a type of candy bars\n\nChocolate chips are small pieces of chocolate, usually drop-like, which are meant for decoration and baking\n\nPistoles , callets and f\xc3\xa8ves are small, coin-like or bean-like pieces of chocolate meant for baking and patisserie applications (also see Pistole (coin) and F\xc3\xa8ve (trinket))\n\n, and are small, coin-like or bean-like pieces of chocolate meant for baking and patisserie applications (also see Pistole (coin) and F\xc3\xa8ve (trinket)) Chocolate blocks are large, cuboid chunks of chocolate meant for professional use and further processing\n\nOther, more specialized shapes for chocolate include sticks, curls and hollow semi-spheres\n\nStorage\n\nChocolate is very sensitive to temperature and humidity. Ideal storage temperatures are between 15 and 17 \xc2\xb0C (59 and 63 \xc2\xb0F), with a relative humidity of less than 50%. If refrigerated or frozen without containment, chocolate can absorb enough moisture to cause a whitish discoloration, the result of fat or sugar crystals rising to the surface. Various types of ""blooming"" effects can occur if chocolate is stored or served improperly.[75]\n\nChocolate bloom is caused by storage temperature fluctuating or exceeding 24 \xc2\xb0C (75 \xc2\xb0F), while sugar bloom is caused by temperature below 15 \xc2\xb0C (59 \xc2\xb0F) or excess humidity. To distinguish between different types of bloom, one can rub the surface of the chocolate lightly, and if the bloom disappears, it is fat bloom. Moving chocolate between temperature extremes, can result in an oily texture. Although visually unappealing, chocolate suffering from bloom is safe for consumption and taste unaffected.[76][77][78] Bloom can be reversed by retempering the chocolate or using it for any use that requires melting the chocolate.[79]\n\nChocolate is generally stored away from other foods, as it can absorb different aromas. Ideally, chocolates are packed or wrapped, and placed in proper storage with the correct humidity and temperature. Additionally, chocolate is frequently stored in a dark place or protected from light by wrapping paper. The glossy shine, snap, aroma, texture, and taste of the chocolate can show the quality and if it was stored well.[80]\n\nComposition\n\nNutrition\n\nA 100-gram serving of milk chocolate supplies 540 calories. It is 59% carbohydrates (52% as sugar and 3% as dietary fiber), 30% fat and 8% protein (table). Approximately 65% of the fat in milk chocolate is saturated, mainly palmitic acid and stearic acid, while the predominant unsaturated fat is oleic acid (table).\n\n100-grams of milk chocolate is an excellent source (over 19% of the Daily Value, DV) of riboflavin, vitamin B12 and the dietary minerals, manganese, phosphorus and zinc. Chocolate is a good source (10\xe2\x80\x9319% DV) of calcium, magnesium and iron.\n\nEffects on health\n\nChocolate may be a factor for heartburn in some people because one of its constituents, theobromine, may affect the esophageal sphincter muscle in a way that permits stomach acids to enter the esophagus.[81] Theobromine poisoning is an overdosage reaction to the bitter alkaloid, which happens more frequently in domestic animals than humans. However, daily intake of 50\xe2\x80\x93100 g cocoa (0.8\xe2\x80\x931.5 g theobromine) by humans has been associated with sweating, trembling and severe headache.[82] Chocolate contains alkaloids such as theobromine and phenethylamine, which have physiological effects in humans, but the presence of theobromine renders it toxic to some animals, including dogs and cats.[83]\n\nAccording to a 2005 study, the average lead concentration of cocoa beans is \xe2\x89\xa4 0.5 ng/g, which is one of the lowest reported values for a natural food.[84] However, during cultivation and production, chocolate may absorb lead from the environment (such as in atmospheric emissions of leaded gasoline, which is still being used in Nigeria).[84] Reports from 2014 indicate that ""chocolate might be a significant source"" of lead ingestion for children if consumption is high (with dark chocolate containing higher amounts),[85][86] and ""one 10 g cube of dark chocolate may contain as much as 20% of the daily lead oral limit.""[85]\n\nChocolate and cocoa contain moderate to high amounts of oxalate,[87][88] which may increase the risk of kidney stones.[89]\n\nA few studies have documented allergic reactions from chocolate in children.[81] Other research has shown that dark chocolate can aggravate acne in men who are prone to it.[90] Research has also shown that consuming dark chocolate does not substantially affect blood pressure.[40] Chocolate and cocoa are under preliminary research to determine if consumption affects the risk of certain cardiovascular diseases[91] or cognitive abilities.[92]\n\nOne tablespoonful (5 grams) of dry unsweetened cocoa powder has 12.1 mg of caffeine[93] and a 25-g single serving of dark chocolate has 22.4 mg of caffeine.[94] Although a single 7 oz. serving of coffee may contain 80\xe2\x80\x93175 mg,[95] studies have shown psychoactive effects in caffeine doses as low as 9 mg,[96] and a dose as low as 12.5 mg was shown to have effects on cognitive performance.[97]\n\nExcessive consumption of large quantities of any energy-rich food, such as chocolate, without a corresponding increase in activity to expend the associated calories, can cause weight gain and possibly lead to obesity.[81] Raw chocolate is high in cocoa butter, a fat which is removed during chocolate refining and then added back in varying proportions during the manufacturing process. Manufacturers may add other fats, sugars, and milk, all of which increase the caloric content of chocolate.[81]\n\nPhytochemicals\n\nIn comparison to most foods, cocoa contains more phenolic antioxidants.[98] Cocoa solids are a source of flavonoids[99] and alkaloids, such as theobromine, phenethylamine, and caffeine.[100]\n\nLabeling\n\nSome manufacturers provide the percentage of chocolate in a finished chocolate confection as a label quoting percentage of ""cocoa"" or ""cacao"". This refers to the combined percentage of both cocoa solids and cocoa butter in the bar, not just the percentage of cocoa solids.[101] The Belgian AMBAO certification mark indicates that no non-cocoa vegetable fats have been used in making the chocolate.[102][103] A long-standing dispute between Britain on the one hand and Belgium and France over British use of vegetable fats in chocolate ended in 2000 with the adoption of new standards which permitted the use of up to five percent vegetable fats in clearly labelled products.[104] This British style of chocolate has sometimes been pejoratively referred to as ""vegelate"".[104]\n\nChocolates that are organic[105] or fair trade certified[106] carry labels accordingly.\n\nIn the United States, some large chocolate manufacturers lobbied the federal government to permit confections containing cheaper hydrogenated vegetable oil in place of cocoa butter to be sold as ""chocolate"". In June 2007, in response to consumer concern about the proposal, the FDA reiterated ""Cacao fat, as one of the signature characteristics of the product, will remain a principal component of standardized chocolate.""[107]\n\nIndustry\n\nChocolate, prevalent throughout the world, is a steadily growing, US$50 billion-a-year worldwide business.[108] Europe accounts for 45% of the world\'s chocolate revenue,[109] and the US spent $20 billion in 2013.[110] Big Chocolate is the grouping of major international chocolate companies in Europe and the U.S. U.S. companies Mars and Hershey\'s alone generated $13 billion a year in chocolate sales and account for two-thirds of U.S. production in 2004.[111] Despite the expanding reach of the chocolate industry internationally, cocoa farmers and labourers in the Ivory Coast are unaware of the uses of the beans; the high cost of chocolate products in the Ivory Coast make it inaccessible to the majority of the population, who do not know what it tastes like.[112]\n\nManufacturers\n\nChocolate with various fillings\n\nChocolate manufacturers produce a range of products from chocolate bars to fudge. Large manufacturers of chocolate products include Cadbury (the world\'s largest confectionery manufacturer), Ferrero, Guylian, The Hershey Company, Lindt & Spr\xc3\xbcngli, Mars, Incorporated, Milka, Neuhaus and Suchard.\n\nGuylian is best known for its chocolate sea shells; Cadbury for its Dairy Milk and Creme Egg. The Hershey Company, the largest chocolate manufacturer in North America, produces the Hershey Bar and Hershey\'s Kisses.[113] Mars Incorporated, a large privately owned U.S. corporation, produces Mars Bar, Milky Way, M&M\'s, Twix, and Snickers. Lindt is known for its truffle balls and gold foil-wrapped Easter bunnies.\n\nFood conglomerates Nestl\xc3\xa9 SA and Kraft Foods both have chocolate brands. Nestl\xc3\xa9 acquired Rowntree\'s in 1988 and now markets chocolates under their brand, including Smarties (a chocolate candy) and Kit Kat (a chocolate bar); Kraft Foods through its 1990 acquisition of Jacobs Suchard, now owns Milka and Suchard. In February 2010, Kraft also acquired British-based Cadbury;[114] Fry\'s, Trebor Basset and the fair trade brand Green & Black\'s also belongs to the group.\n\nChild labor in cocoa harvesting\n\nThe widespread use of children in cocoa production is controversial, not only for the concerns about child labor and exploitation, but also because up to 12,000 of the 200,000 children working in C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire, the world\'s biggest producer of cocoa,[115] may be victims of trafficking or slavery.[116] Most attention on this subject has focused on West Africa, which collectively supplies 69 percent of the world\'s cocoa, and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire in particular, which supplies 35 percent of the world\'s cocoa. Thirty percent of children under age 15 in sub-Saharan Africa are child laborers, mostly in agricultural activities including cocoa farming.[118] Major chocolate producers, such as Nestl\xc3\xa9, buy cocoa at commodities exchanges where Ivorian cocoa is mixed with other cocoa.[119]\n\nIn 2009, Salvation Army International Development (SAID) UK stated that 12,000 children have been trafficked on cocoa farms in the Ivory Coast of Africa, where half of the world\'s chocolate is made.[120] SAID UK states that it is these child slaves who are likely to be working in ""harsh and abusive""[121] conditions for the production of chocolate,[120] and an increasing number of health-food[122] and anti-slavery[123] organisations are highlighting and campaigning against the use of trafficking in the chocolate industry.\n\nAs of 2017, approximately 2.1 million children in Ghana and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire were involved in farming cocoa, carrying heavy loads, clearing forests, and being exposed to pesticides.[5] According to Sona Ebai, the former secretary-general of the Alliance of Cocoa Producing Countries: ""I think child labor cannot be just the responsibility of industry to solve. I think it\'s the proverbial all-hands-on-deck: government, civil society, the private sector. And there, you need leadership.""[116] Reported in 2018, a 3-year pilot program \xe2\x80\x93 conducted by Nestl\xc3\xa9 with 26,000 farmers mostly located in C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire \xe2\x80\x93 observed a 51% decrease in the number of children doing hazardous jobs in cocoa farming.[4] The US Department of Labor formed the Child Labor Cocoa Coordinating Group as a public-private partnership with the governments of Ghana and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire to address child labor practices in the cocoa industry.[124] The International Cocoa Initiative involving major cocoa manufacturers established the Child Labor Monitoring and Remediation System intended to monitor thousands of farms in Ghana and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire for child labor conditions,[4][5] but the program reached less than 20% of the child laborers.[125] Despite these efforts, goals to reduce child labor in West Africa by 70% before 2020 are frustrated by persistent poverty, absence of schools, expansion of cocoa farmland, and increased demand for cocoa.[4][126]\n\nIn April 2018, the Cocoa Barometer report stated: ""Not a single company or government is anywhere near reaching the sector-wide objective of the elimination of child labor, and not even near their commitments of a 70% reduction of child labor by 2020"".[126]\n\nFair trade\n\nIn the 2000s, some chocolate producers began to engage in fair trade initiatives, to address concerns about the marginalization of cocoa laborers in developing countries. Traditionally, Africa and other developing countries received low prices for their exported commodities such as cocoa, which caused poverty to abound. Fairtrade seeks to establish a system of direct trade from developing countries to counteract this unfair system.[127] One solution for fair labor practices is for farmers to become part of an Agricultural cooperative. Cooperatives pay farmers a fair price for their cocoa so farmers have enough money for food, clothes, and school fees.[128] One of the main tenets of fair trade is that farmers receive a fair price, but this does not mean that the larger amount of money paid for fair trade cocoa goes directly to the farmers. The effectiveness of fair trade has been questioned. In a 2014 article, The Economist stated that workers on fair trade farms have a lower standard of living than on similar farms outside the fair trade system.[129]\n\nUsage and consumption\n\ns\'more topped with melted chocolate from a chocolate bar\n\nChocolate cake with chocolate frosting\n\nBars\n\nChocolate is sold in chocolate bars, which come in dark chocolate, milk chocolate and white chocolate varieties. Some bars that are mostly chocolate have other ingredients blended into the chocolate, such as nuts, raisins, or crisped rice. Chocolate is used as an ingredient in a huge variety of bars, which typically contain various confectionary ingredients (e.g., nougat, wafers, caramel, nuts, etc.) which are coated in chocolate.\n\nCoating and filling\n\nChocolate is used as a flavouring product in many desserts, such as chocolate cakes, chocolate brownies, chocolate mousse and chocolate chip cookies. Numerous types of candy and snacks contain chocolate, either as a filling (e.g., M&M\'s) or as a coating (e.g., chocolate-coated raisins or chocolate-coated peanuts).\n\nBeverages\n\nSome non-alcoholic beverages contain chocolate, such as chocolate milk, hot chocolate, chocolate milkshakes and tejate. Some alcoholic liqueurs are flavoured with chocolate, such as chocolate liqueur and creme de cacao. Chocolate is a popular flavour of ice cream and pudding, and chocolate sauce is a commonly added as a topping on ice cream sundaes. The caff\xc3\xa8 mocha is an espresso beverage containing chocolate.\n\nSee also\n\nReferences'";"Other";"301.txt-Other"

"304.txt";"b'Chocolate is the most popular sweet treat in the world. People around the world (but mostly in Europe and the United States) consume more than 3 million tons of cocoa beans a year, according to the World Cocoa Foundation. And, not only does eating chocolate make you feel good, it may also be good for your heart and your brain.\n\nWhat is chocolate?\n\nChocolate is prepared from the fruit of the Theobroma cacao, a tropical tree whose name means ""food of the gods"" in Greek, according to ""Chocolate: Food of the Gods,"" an online exhibit by the Cornell University Library.\n\nTheobroma cacao trees are native to the Amazon and Orinoco river basins in South America. The trees are widely distributed from southeastern Mexico to the Amazon River. They thrive in hot, humid areas within about 20 degrees of the equator, according to Cornell. As the popularity of chocolate spread, growers established plantations in other regions, such as West Africa and South and Southeast Asia. Today, Ghana, C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire, Nigeria, Indonesia and Brazil account for 79 percent of the world\'s cacao production.\n\nCacao trees bear fruit that are about the same size and shape of a papaya, according to Patric Chocolate. These bumpy, lumpy berries, or pods, are full of up to 50 sour seeds, or beans, covered in white pulp.\n\nCacao seeds are harvested by hand because machines could injure the trees, according to Cornell. Workers remove the pods, which are orange when they are ripe, and open them with a machete. The seeds are placed in large fermentation trays that are stacked and covered in banana leaves, where they are left for two to seven days. Fermentation produces the chocolate flavor and aroma. It also destroys the seed\'s embryo, preventing unwanted germination, and causes the white pulp to fall away from the seeds.\n\nAfter fermenting, the beans dry out on sunny platforms. Workers turn them several times a day for three to five days to complete drying. The beans can dry faster in rotary driers but sun-dried beans taste the best, according to Cornell.\n\nNext, the beans are taken to the chocolate factory, where they are cleaned and debris is removed. The beans are roasted in large, rotating ovens. The roasting draws out flavor and removes the beans from their hulls. Roasted beans go into a winnowing machine, which cracks the beans and removes hulls. The remaining part of the bean is called the nib. Nibs become chocolate.\n\nThe nibs are ground down under a series of rollers. This process results in a thick paste called chocolate liquor. Chocolate liquor does not contain alcohol (however, chocolate liqueur does). It is the main source of unsweetened baking chocolate, according to Pam Williams, co-founder and past president of the Fine Chocolate Industry Association (FCIA) and founder and lead instructor of Ecole Cocolat Professional School of Chocolate Arts.\n\nAt this stage, the type of chocolate being produced is determined. According to the FCIA, ingredients separate fine chocolate from that of average quality. ""Fine chocolate,"" as designated by the FCIA, contains only cacao liquor, cacao butter (optional), sugar, lecithin, vanilla (optional) and possibly milk fats and solids. Additional flavors or ingredients like nuts can be added later.\n\n(Image credit: Dreamstime)\n\nTypes of chocolate\n\nFine chocolate falls into three categories: dark chocolate, milk chocolate and white chocolate, Williams said.\n\nDark chocolate has chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, lecithin, sugar and vanilla.\n\nMilk chocolate has all of the above plus milk fats and milk solids.\n\nWhite chocolate contains everything milk chocolate does except chocolate liquor.\n\nChocolatiers debate whether white chocolate is really chocolate. Until 2002, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration considered it a confectionary rather than chocolate because it does not contain chocolate liquor. The Hershey Food Corp. and the Chocolate Manufacturers Association petitioned the FDA, which added a standard of identity for white chocolate. Because the FDA refers to it as white chocolate, rather than confectionary, some experts, like Williams, accept white chocolate as chocolate.\n\nWithin the three categories, the FDA also acknowledges several grades, Williams said. They include unsweetened or brute, which can be up to 99 percent chocolate liquor; bittersweet; semisweet; and dark milk chocolate. The type of chocolate depends on what ingredients are present and the percentage of cocoa, in addition to where the beans are from and the way they are prepared.\n\nHealth benefits of chocolate\n\nGood heart food\n\nSeveral recent studies have examined the role that chocolate may have on heart health. Cacao beans are full of phytonutrients, which act as antioxidants and provide additional benefits. Furthermore, cacao beans are rich sources of iron, copper, magnesium, zinc and phosphorus, according to the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Dark chocolate contains two to three times more beneficial flavanols than milk chocolate because milk chocolate\'s cacao concentration is diluted with milk and possibly more sugar.\n\nWhile most studies have found some correlation between chocolate consumption and reduced risk of heart problems, the amount and type of chocolate needed requires further study. A 2017 meta-analysis of the effects of chocolate on coronary heart disease, stroke and diabetes published in the journal Nutrients concluded that the most benefit was associated with moderate chocolate intake. The authors found little benefit in heart disease or stroke reduction among people who consumed chocolate more than three times a week. Protective effects against diabetes emerged at two servings a week, but that benefit disappeared if people had more than six servings a week.\n\nOn the other hand, the findings of a large-scale study of more than 150,000 primarily male U.S. veterans who did not have coronary artery disease at the beginning of the study, suggest that eating an ounce of chocolate at least five times a week may help prevent the risk of coronary artery disease-related events like heart attack and heart failure.\n\nChocolate may also help prevent the development of atrial fibrillation, a type of irregular heartbeat that increases the risk of heart failure, stroke and more. A study, published in the journal Heart in 2017, found that adults who ate chocolate at least once a month had 10 to 20 percent lower rates of developing atrial fibrillation than those who never or rarely ate chocolate.\n\nGood brain food\n\nChocolate may be good for the brain. Some studies have focused on chocolate\'s ability to improve cognitive function. A study published in the Journal of Alzheimer\'s Disease in 2016 found that chocolate consumption might lower the risk of cognitive decline in older people. The study looked at nearly 400 Portuguese citizens over age 65 and saw that those who ate a moderate amount of chocolate \xe2\x80\x94 on average, one chocolate snack a week; the study did not differentiate between milk and dark chocolate \xe2\x80\x94 decreased their risk of cognitive decline by 40 percent over two years. Those who ate more chocolate, or those who had more caffeine, saw fewer cognitive benefits.\n\nGood mood food\n\nChocolate is often associated with positive effects on mood, but the reasons why it makes some people feel good are debatable. Chocolate contains substances that stimulate the brain in the same way cannabis does, such as anandamines, and substances that have similar effects as amphetamine, such as tyramine and phenylethylamine, according to the Dartmouth Undergraduate Journal of Science. However, these substances are in very low concentrations \xe2\x80\x94 too low to induce an antidepressant effect.\n\nChocolate may interact with neurotransmitter systems that contribute to appetite, reward and mood regulation, such as dopamine, serotonin and endorphins, according to the 2013 article in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology. However, the authors noted, the effects may have more to do with chocolate\'s taste and smell than its chemical effects.\n\nA 2010 study published in Archives of Internal Medicine found a link between depression and chocolate consumption. The results showed that people who scored high on a screening test for depression consumed more chocolate than those who weren\'t considered depressed. However, the study pointed out that there is only a link, and cannot explain why. Since the participants were not followed over time, the researchers don\'t know whether eating chocolate ameliorates or amplifies a sad mood. The possibilities are many \xe2\x80\x94 from using chocolate as a sort of natural Prozac to the idea that chocolate might have some role in driving depression.\n\nHealth risks of eating chocolate\n\nLike many foods, chocolate is healthiest when eaten in moderation. The sugars and fats that are added to chocolate make it high in calories, which may lead to weight gain. Furthermore, many of the protective effects that chocolate may offer might be mitigated by overconsumption.\n\nHistory of chocolate\n\nScientists debate how long humans have been using and consuming cacao beans. Chocolate\'s history goes back at least 2,000 years, while historians Sophie and Michael Coe, authors of ""The True History of Chocolate"" (Thames and Hudson, 2013), suggest that it might go back four millennia. The word chocolate can be traced back to the Aztec word ""xocoatl,"" the name for a bitter drink made from cacao beans. This was the way chocolate was consumed until the Spanish conquistadors came to Central America.\n\nIn several pre-Columbian Latin American societies, cacao beans were used as currency, according to Smithsonian magazine. Mayans and Aztecs believed the beans had mystical properties and used them during important rituals. When the Spanish arrived, sweetened chocolate came into existence. Legend has it that the Aztec king Montezuma gave conquistador Hern\xc3\xa1n Cort\xc3\xa9s a bitter chocolate drink, which he said was disgusting. But Cort\xc3\xa9s\' men added cane sugar and honey to it and took it back to Spain, where it quickly became popular.\n\nChocolate was a fashionable drink for rich Europeans throughout the 18th century. The Industrial Revolution allowed chocolate to be mass-produced and brought the treat to the masses. The popularity led to the development of cacao tree plantations.\n\nEnslaved people farmed most of the plantations. Initially, Spanish colonizers forced Mesoamericans to farm the cacao plantations, according to ""The Biography of Chocolate"" (Crabtree Publishing Co., 2005), by Adrianna Morganelli. When the indigenous peoples began to die in large numbers from diseases brought by Europeans, enslaved Africans were brought over to make up the labor shortage. In addition to sugarcane, indigo and other crops, enslaved Africans planted, maintained and harvested cacao trees throughout the Caribbean, Central and South America to feed the new European taste for chocolate.\n\nIn 1815, Dutch physicist Coenraad Van Houten experimented with removing varied amounts of the cocoa butter from chocolate liquor, according to Cornell University. This led to the creation of cocoa powder and soon solid chocolate.\n\nIn 1847, a Bristol, England, chocolate company, Fry\'s, created the first mass-produced chocolate bar when Joseph Fry added additional cocoa butter to Van Houten\'s chocolate, which turned it into a moldable paste, according to Bristol Museums. Milk chocolate was invented soon after with the help of Henri Nestl\xc3\xa9, who went on to found the major food company that bears his name. Major European chocolate brands Lindt and Cadbury also got their start in the 1800s; Rodolphe Lindt invented the conching machine, which gives chocolate a velvety texture.\n\nMass chocolate consumption hit the United States in the late 1800s when Milton S. Hershey began selling chocolate-coated caramels. He then developed his own formula for milk chocolate, purchased chocolate factory equipment and introduced mass-produced chocolate bars and other shapes, like Hershey\'s Kisses, in 1900.\n\nIn 1923, the Mars Co. developed the Milky Way bar by putting nougat inside a chocolate bar. That same year, former Hershey employee H.B. Reese introduced Reese\'s Peanut Butter Cups, which later became part of the Hershey brand.\n\nAs the years progressed, chocolate concoctions from both small and large producers became increasingly innovative. In September 2017, Swiss chocolate company Barry Callebaut introduced ruby chocolate. Ruby chocolate comes from isolating specific compounds in cocoa beans, according to Confectionary News. That, along with a modified processing technique, results in a rosy pink chocolate that has a sweet but sour berry taste and no traditional chocolate flavor, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. Other colored chocolates are made from dyed white chocolate.\n\nThreats to chocolate\n\nChocolate production is threatened by climate change. According to a 2016 report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the primary cacao-producing countries of C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire, Ghana, and Indonesia will experience a 2.1 degree Celsius (3.7 degrees Fahrenheit) increase in temperature by 2050. Rainfall will not rise along with the temperature, causing lowered humidity levels. As a result, viable land for cacao production will significantly shrink. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\'s Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability report, 89.5 percent of the 294 chocolate-producing locations studied would become less suitable by 2050.\n\nFarmers and scientists are working to develop strategies to maintain chocolate production. Some farmers are planting taller trees next to cacao trees to increase shade and decrease moisture loss, according to the NOAA. Cacao plantations may also move to higher elevations with cooler temperatures and greater rainfall.\n\nGenetic scientists are taking a different approach. A January 2018 press release from the Innovative Genomics Institute announced a project to develop disease-resistant cacao. Condensing cacao plantations because of climate change could increase the spread of disease. The project will use CRISPR DNA-editing technology to make a heartier cacao seed.\n\nEthics of chocolate production\n\nAccording to Slave Free Chocolate, 2.3 million children work in chocolate production in Ghana and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire, where they are vulnerable to trafficking, slavery and other violent labor practices. The International Labor Rights Forum reports that these children are often exposed to chemicals, work long hours and are denied education. According to Epicure and Culture, many children are sold into slavery and never see their families again. Others are kidnapped.\n\nThough the Harkin-Engel Protocol of 2001 was designed to stop child labor in the chocolate industry, according to the CNN Freedom Project, little has changed. The deadlines for action have been repeatedly pushed back.\n\nConsumers who want ethical chocolate should look for certifications designating Fair Trade, Rain Forest Alliance, UTZ, and Fair for Life, according to Slave Free Chocolate\xe2\x80\x99s guide to chocolate companies.\n\nChocolate production can also harm the environment. Farmers often clear forests to make room for cacao plantations. According to the World Wildlife Fund, about 70 percent of C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire\'s illegal deforestation is related to cacao farming. One danger of deforestation is soil erosion, which can make land less fertile for cacao plants, creating a vicious cycle, according to Confectionary News.\n\nAdditional resources'";"Other";"304.txt-Other"
"308.txt";"b'The history of chocolate can be traced back more than 3,000 years to the Maya, Toltec, and Aztec people who prepared a beverage from the fruit of the cocoa bean. The Maya considered chocolate to be the food of the gods, held the cacao tree to be sacred, and buried dignitaries with bowls of chocolate.\n\nFull Article\n\nchocolate , food product made from cocoa beans , consumed as candy and used to make beverages and to flavour or coat various confections and bakery products. Rich in carbohydrates , it is an excellent source of quick energy, and it also contains minute amounts of the stimulating alkaloids theobromine and caffeine .\n\nHistory of chocolate\n\nThe cacao tree was cultivated more than 3,000 years ago by the Maya, Toltec, and Aztec peoples, who prepared a beverage from its fruit, the cocoa bean (sometimes using it as a ceremonial drink) and also used the bean as a currency. The Maya considered chocolate to be the food of the gods, held the cacao tree to be sacred, and even buried dignitaries with bowls of the substance (along with other items deemed useful in the afterlife). In fact, the identification of the (Olmec-originated) word ka-ka-w (\xe2\x80\x9ccacao\xe2\x80\x9d) inscribed on those containers was key to deciphering the Maya\xe2\x80\x99s phonetic manner of writing.\n\nSpain was the earliest European country to incorporate chocolate into its cuisine, but exactly how that happened is vague. It is known that Christopher Columbus took cocoa beans to Spain after his fourth voyage in 1502, though little was made of it at that time. It has been commonly thought (though there appears to be no evidence) that in 1519 Montezuma II, the Aztec ruler of Mexico, served a bitter cocoa-bean drink to the Spanish conquistador Hern\xc3\xa1n Cort\xc3\xa9s, who subsequently introduced the drink to Spain. A strong possibility is that chocolate first arrived in Spain in 1544 with representatives of the Kekch\xc3\xad Mayan people of Guatemala, who came bearing gifts (including chocolate) to visit the court of Prince Philip. However, it was not until 1585 that the first recorded shipment of cocoa beans arrived in Spain from Veracruz, Mexico. Sweetened and flavoured with cinnamon and vanilla, chocolate was served as a hot beverage and became quite popular in the Spanish court. It was many years before chocolate had its introduction to France, England, and beyond.\n\nengraving of an Aztec with cocoa beans and chocolate beverage \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican with his chocolate pot and goblet,\xe2\x80\x9d an engraving of an Aztec with cocoa beans and chocolate beverage, from a French history of chocolate, tea, and coffee, 1685. From Traitez Nouveaux and curieux du caf\xc3\xa9 du th\xc3\xa9 et du chocolate, by Philippe Sylvestre Dufour, 1685\n\nIn 1657 a Frenchman opened a shop in London at which solid chocolate for making the beverage could be purchased at 10 to 15 shillings per pound. At that price only the wealthy could afford to drink it, and there appeared in London, Amsterdam, and other European capitals fashionable chocolate houses, some of which later developed into famous private clubs. In London many chocolate houses were used as political party meeting places as well as high-stakes gambling spots, notably Cocoa-Tree Chocolate-House (later the Cocoa-Tree Club), which opened in 1698, and White\xe2\x80\x99s, which was opened by Francis White in 1693 as White\xe2\x80\x99s Chocolate-House. About 1700 the English improved chocolate by the addition of milk. The reduction of the cost of the beverage was hampered in Great Britain by the imposition of high import duties on the raw cocoa bean, and it was not until the mid-19th century, when the duty was lowered to a uniform rate of one penny per pound, that chocolate became popular.\n\nMeanwhile, the making of chocolate spread overseas and grew in sophistication. Chocolate manufacture started in the American colonies in 1765 at Dorchester, Massachusetts, using beans brought in by New England sea captains from their voyages to the West Indies. James Baker financed the first mill, which was operated by an Irish immigrant, John Hanan. Waterpower was used for grinding the beans. In the Netherlands in 1828, C.J. van Houten patented a process for pressing much of the fat, or cocoa butter, from ground and roasted cocoa beans and thus obtaining cocoa powder. In 1847 the English firm of Fry and Sons combined cocoa butter with chocolate liquor and sugar to produce sweet (eating) chocolate\xe2\x80\x94the base of most chocolate confectionary\xe2\x80\x94and in 1876 Daniel Peter of Switzerland added dried milk to make milk chocolate. The proliferation of flavoured, solid, and coated chocolate foods rapidly followed.'";"Other";"308.txt-Other"
"309.txt";"b'Share on Pinterest Screen Moment/Stocksy United Dark chocolate is loaded with nutrients that can positively affect your health. Made from the seed of the cacao tree, it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the best sources of antioxidants you can find. Studies show that dark chocolate can improve your health and lower the risk of heart disease. This article reviews 7 health benefits of dark chocolate or cocoa that are supported by science.\n\n1. Very nutritious If you buy quality dark chocolate with a high cocoa content, then it\xe2\x80\x99s quite nutritious. It contains a decent amount of soluble fiber and is loaded with minerals. A 100-gram bar of dark chocolate with 70\xe2\x80\x9385% cocoa contains (1): 11 grams of fiber\n\n67% of the DV for iron\n\n58% of the DV for magnesium\n\n89% of the DV for copper\n\n98% of the DV for manganese In addition, it has plenty of potassium, phosphorus, zinc, and selenium. Of course, 100 grams (3.5 ounces) is a fairly large amount and not something you should be consuming daily. These nutrients also come with 600 calories and moderate amounts of sugar. For this reason, dark chocolate is best consumed in moderation. The fatty acid profile of cocoa and dark chocolate is also good. The fats consist mostly of oleic acid (a heart-healthy fat also found in olive oil), stearic acid, and palmitic acid. The stearic acid has a neutral effect on body cholesterol. Palmitic acid can raise cholesterol levels, but it only makes up one-third of the total fat calories. Dark chocolate also contains stimulants like caffeine and theobromine, but it\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely to keep you awake at night, as the amount of caffeine is very small compared with coffee. Summary Quality dark chocolate is rich in fiber, iron, magnesium, copper, manganese, and a few other minerals.\n\n2. Powerful source of antioxidants ORAC stands for oxygen radical absorbance capacity. It\xe2\x80\x99s a measure of the antioxidant activity of foods. Basically, researchers set a bunch of free radicals (bad) against a sample of a food and see how well the antioxidants in the food can disarm the free radicals. The biological relevance of ORAC values is questioned, as it\xe2\x80\x99s measured in a test tube and may not have the same effect in the body. However, it\xe2\x80\x99s worth mentioning that raw, unprocessed cocoa beans are among the highest-scoring foods that have been tested. Dark chocolate is loaded with organic compounds that are biologically active and function as antioxidants. These include polyphenols, flavanols and catechins, among others. One study showed that cocoa and dark chocolate had more antioxidant activity, polyphenols, and flavanols than any other fruits tested, which included blueberries and acai berries (2). Summary Cocoa and dark chocolate have a wide variety of powerful antioxidants. In fact, they have way more than most other foods.\n\n3. May improve blood flow and lower blood pressure The flavanols in dark chocolate can stimulate the endothelium, the lining of arteries, to produce nitric oxide (NO) ( 3 ). One of the functions of NO is to send signals to the arteries to relax, which lowers the resistance to blood flow and therefore reduces blood pressure. Many controlled studies show that cocoa and dark chocolate can improve blood flow and lower blood pressure, though the effects are usually mild ( 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ). However, one study in people with high blood pressure showed no effect, so take this with a grain of salt ( 8 ). Given the great variation between studies on this subject, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that more research is needed ( 9 , 10). Summary The bioactive compounds in cocoa may improve blood flow in the arteries and cause a small but statistically significant decrease in blood pressure.\n\n4. Raises HDL and protects LDL from oxidation Consuming dark chocolate can improve several important risk factors for heart disease. In a controlled study, cocoa powder was found to significantly decrease oxidized LDL (bad) cholesterol in men. It also increased HDL and lowered total LDL for those with high cholesterol ( 11 ). Oxidized LDL means that the LDL cholesterol has reacted with free radicals. This makes the LDL particle itself reactive and capable of damaging other tissues, such as the lining of the arteries in your heart. It makes perfect sense that cocoa lowers oxidized LDL. It contains an abundance of powerful antioxidants that do make it into the bloodstream and protect lipoproteins against oxidative damage ( 12 , 13 , 14 ). The flavanols in dark chocolate can also reduce insulin resistance, which is another common risk factor for diseases like heart disease and diabetes ( 15 , 16 , 17 ). However, dark chocolate also contains sugar, which can have the opposite effect. Summary Dark chocolate improves several important risk factors for disease. It lowers the susceptibility of LDL to oxidative damage while increasing HDL and improving insulin sensitivity.\n\n5. May reduce heart disease risk The compounds in dark chocolate appear to be highly protective against the oxidation of LDL. In the long term, this should cause much less cholesterol to lodge in the arteries, resulting in a lower risk of heart disease. In fact, several long-term observational studies show a fairly drastic improvement. In a study of 470 older men, cocoa was found to reduce the risk of death from heart disease by 50% over 15 years ( 18 ). Another study revealed that eating chocolate two or more times per week lowered the risk of having calcified plaque in the arteries by 32%. Eating chocolate less frequently had no effect ( 19 ). Yet another study showed that eating dark chocolate more than five times per week lowered the risk of heart disease by 57% ( 20 ). A 2017 clinical trial found that subjects who consumed almonds with or without dark chocolate showed improved LDL cholesterol levels (21). Of course, these four studies are observational, so it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear exactly if it was the chocolate that reduced the risk. However, since the biological process is known (lower blood pressure and oxidized LDL), it\xe2\x80\x99s plausible that regularly eating dark chocolate may reduce the risk of heart disease. Summary Observational studies show a drastic reduction in heart disease risk among those who consume the most chocolate.\n\n6. May protect your skin from the sun The bioactive compounds in dark chocolate may also be great for your skin. The flavanols can protect against sun damage, improve blood flow to the skin, and increase skin density and hydration ( 22 ). The minimal erythemal dose (MED) is the minimum amount of UVB rays required to cause redness in the skin 24 hours after exposure. In one study of 30 people, the MED more than doubled after consuming dark chocolate high in flavanols for 12 weeks ( 23 ). If you\xe2\x80\x99re planning a beach vacation, consider enjoying some extra dark chocolate in the prior weeks and months. But check with your doctor or dermatologist before forgoing your normal skin care routine in favor of more dark chocolate. Summary Studies show that the flavanols from cocoa can improve blood flow to the skin and protect it from sun damage.\n\n7. Could improve brain function The good news isn\xe2\x80\x99t over yet. Dark chocolate may also improve the function of your brain. One study of healthy volunteers showed that eating high flavanol cocoa for 5 days improved blood flow to the brain ( 24 ). Cocoa may also significantly improve cognitive function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment. It may improve verbal fluency and several risk factors for disease, as well ( 25 ). Additionally, cocoa contains stimulant substances like caffeine and theobromine, which may be a key reason why it can improve brain function in the short term ( 26 ). Summary Cocoa or dark chocolate may improve brain function by increasing blood flow. It also contains stimulants like caffeine and theobromine.'";"Other";"309.txt-Other"

"317.txt";"b'When most of us hear the word chocolate, we picture a bar, a box of bonbons, or a bunny. The verb that comes to mind is probably ""eat,"" not ""drink,"" and the most apt adjective would seem to be ""sweet."" But for about 90 percent of chocolate\'s long history, it was strictly a beverage, and sugar didn\'t have anything to do with it.\n\n""I often call chocolate the best-known food that nobody knows anything about,"" said Alexandra Leaf, a self-described ""chocolate educator"" who runs a business called Chocolate Tours of New York City.\n\nThe terminology can be a little confusing, but most experts these days use the term ""cacao"" to refer to the plant or its beans before processing, while the term ""chocolate"" refers to anything made from the beans, she explained. ""Cocoa"" generally refers to chocolate in a powdered form, although it can also be a British form of ""cacao.""\n\nEtymologists trace the origin of the word ""chocolate"" to the Aztec word ""xocoatl,"" which referred to a bitter drink brewed from cacao beans. The Latin name for the cacao tree, Theobroma cacao, means ""food of the gods.""\n\nMany modern historians have estimated that chocolate has been around for about 2000 years, but recent research suggests that it may be even older.\n\nIn the book The True History of Chocolate, authors Sophie and Michael Coe make a case that the earliest linguistic evidence of chocolate consumption stretches back three or even four millennia, to pre-Columbian cultures of Mesoamerica such as the Olmec.\n\nLast November, anthropologists from the University of Pennsylvania announced the discovery of cacao residue on pottery excavated in Honduras that could date back as far as 1400 B.C.E. It appears that the sweet pulp of the cacao fruit, which surrounds the beans, was fermented into an alcoholic beverage of the time.\n\n""Who would have thought, looking at this, that you can eat it?"" said Richard Hetzler, executive chef of the caf\xc3\xa9 at the Smithsonian\'s National Museum of the American Indian, as he displayed a fresh cacao pod during a recent chocolate-making demonstration. ""You would have to be pretty hungry, and pretty creative!""\n\nIt\'s hard to pin down exactly when chocolate was born, but it\'s clear that it was cherished from the start. For several centuries in pre-modern Latin America, cacao beans were considered valuable enough to use as currency. One bean could be traded for a tamale, while 100 beans could purchase a good turkey hen, according to a 16th-century Aztec document.\n\nBoth the Mayans and Aztecs believed the cacao bean had magical, or even divine, properties, suitable for use in the most sacred rituals of birth, marriage and death. According to Chloe Doutre-Roussel\'s book The Chocolate Connoisseur, Aztec sacrifice victims who felt too melancholy to join in ritual dancing before their death were often given a gourd of chocolate (tinged with the blood of previous victims) to cheer them up. Sweetened chocolate didn\'t appear until Europeans discovered the Americas and sampled the native cuisine. Legend has it that the Aztec king Montezuma welcomed the Spanish explorer Hernando Cortes with a banquet that included drinking chocolate, having tragically mistaken him for a reincarnated deity instead of a conquering invader. Chocolate didn\'t suit the foreigners\' tastebuds at first \xe2\x80\x93one described it in his writings as ""a bitter drink for pigs"" \xe2\x80\x93 but once mixed with honey or cane sugar, it quickly became popular throughout Spain. By the 17th century, chocolate was a fashionable drink throughout Europe, believed to have nutritious, medicinal and even aphrodisiac properties (it\'s rumored that Casanova was especially fond of the stuff). But it remained largely a privilege of the rich until the invention of the steam engine made mass production possible in the late 1700s. In 1828, a Dutch chemist found a way to make powdered chocolate by removing about half the natural fat (cacao butter) from chocolate liquor, pulverizing what remained and treating the mixture with alkaline salts to cut the bitter taste. His product became known as ""Dutch cocoa,"" and it soon led to the creation of solid chocolate. The creation of the first modern chocolate bar is credited to Joseph Fry, who in 1847 discovered that he could make a moldable chocolate paste by adding melted cacao butter back into Dutch cocoa. By 1868, a little company called Cadbury was marketing boxes of chocolate candies in England. Milk chocolate hit the market a few years later, pioneered by another name that may ring a bell \xe2\x80\x93 Nestle. In America, chocolate was so valued during the Revolutionary War that it was included in soldiers\' rations and used in lieu of wages. While most of us probably wouldn\'t settle for a chocolate paycheck these days, statistics show that the humble cacao bean is still a powerful economic force. Chocolate manufacturing is a more than 4-billion-dollar industry in the United States, and the average American eats at least half a pound of the stuff per month. In the 20th century, the word ""chocolate"" expanded to include a range of affordable treats with more sugar and additives than actual cacao in them, often made from the hardiest but least flavorful of the bean varieties (forastero). But more recently, there\'s been a ""chocolate revolution,"" Leaf said, marked by an increasing interest in high-quality, handmade chocolates and sustainable, effective cacao farming and harvesting methods. Major corporations like Hershey\'s have expanded their artisanal chocolate lines by purchasing smaller producers known for premium chocolates, such as Scharffen Berger and Dagoba, while independent chocolatiers continue to flourish as well. ""I see more and more American artisans doing incredible things with chocolate,"" Leaf said. ""Although, I admit that I tend to look at the world through cocoa-tinted glasses.""'";"Other";"317.txt-Other"

They can be found in a variety of foods, such as fruits and vegetables. When we eat foods rich in flavonoids, it appears that we also benefit from this ""antioxidant"" power.\n\nAntioxidants are believed to help the body\'s cells resist damage caused by free radicals that are formed by normal bodily processes, such as breathing, and from environmental contaminants, like cigarette smoke. If your body does not have enough antioxidants to combat the amount of oxidation that occurs, it can become damaged by free radicals. For example, an increase in oxidation can cause low-density lipoprotein (LDL), also known as ""bad"" cholesterol, to form plaque on the artery walls.\n\nFlavanols are the main type of flavonoid found in cocoa and chocolate. In addition to having antioxidant qualities, research shows that flavanols have other potential influences on vascular health, such as lowering blood pressure, improving blood flow to the brain and heart, and making blood platelets less sticky and able to clot.\n\nThese plant chemicals aren\xe2\x80\x99t only found in chocolate. In fact, a wide variety of foods and beverages are rich in flavonols. These include cranberries, apples, peanuts, onions, tea and red wine.\n\nAre all types of chocolate healthy?\n\nBefore you grab a chocolate candy bar or slice of chocolate cake, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand that not all forms of chocolate contain high levels of flavanols.\n\nCocoa naturally has a very strong, pungent taste, which comes from the flavanols. When cocoa is processed into your favorite chocolate products, it goes through several steps to reduce this taste. The more chocolate is processed (through things like fermentation, alkalizing, roasting, etc.), the more flavanols are lost.\n\nMost commercial chocolates are highly processed. Although it was once believed that dark chocolate contained the highest levels of flavanols, recent research indicates that, depending on how the dark chocolate was processed, this may not be true. The good news is that most major chocolate manufacturers are looking for ways to keep the flavanols in their processed chocolates. But for now, your best choices are likely dark chocolate over milk chocolate (especially milk chocolate that is loaded with other fats and sugars) and cocoa powder that has not undergone Dutch processing (cocoa that is treated with an alkali to neutralize its natural acidity).\n\nWhat about all of the fat in chocolate?\n\nYou may be surprised to learn that chocolate isn\xe2\x80\x99t as bad for you as once believed.\n\nThe fat in chocolate comes from cocoa butter and is made up of equal amounts of oleic acid (a heart-healthy monounsaturated fat also found in olive oil), stearic and palmitic acids. Stearic and palmitic acids are forms of saturated fat. You may know that saturated fats are linked to increases in LDL cholesterol and the risk of heart disease.\n\nBut, research shows that stearic acid appears to have a neutral effect on cholesterol, neither raising nor lowering it. Although palmitic acid does affect cholesterol levels, it only makes up one-third of the fat calories in chocolate. Still, this does not mean you can eat all the dark chocolate you\xe2\x80\x99d like.\n\nFirst, be careful about the type of dark chocolate you choose: chewy caramel-marshmallow-nut-covered dark chocolate is by no means a heart-healthy food option. Watch out for those extra ingredients that can add lots of extra fat and calories. Second, there is currently no established serving size of chocolate to help you reap the cardiovascular benefits it may offer, and more research is needed in this area. However, we do know that you no longer need to feel guilty if you enjoy a small piece of dark chocolate once in a while.\n\nSo, for now, enjoy moderate portions of chocolate (e.g., 1 ounce) a few times per week, and don\xe2\x80\x99t forget to eat other flavonoid-rich foods like apples, red wine, tea, onions and cranberries.'";"Other";"323.txt-Other"

"330.txt";"b""Originally consumed as a bitter drink, it was prized as both an aphrodisiac and an energy booster.\n\nMankind\xe2\x80\x99s love affair with chocolate stretches back more than five millennia. Produced from the seeds of tropical cacao trees native to the rainforests of Central and South America, chocolate was long considered the \xe2\x80\x9cfood of the gods,\xe2\x80\x9d and later, a delicacy for the elite. But for most of its history, it was actually consumed as a bitter beverage rather than the sweet, edible treat it has become worldwide.\n\nWhat Is the Birthplace of Chocolate?\n\nMayan cacao drink Ren Photo/Getty Images\n\nArchaeologists have discovered the earliest traces of cacao in pottery used by the ancient Mayo-Chinchipe culture 5,300 years ago in the upper Amazon region of Ecuador. Chocolate played an important political, spiritual and economic role in ancient Mesoamerican civilizations, which ground roasted cacao beans into a paste that they mixed with water, vanilla, chili peppers and other spices to brew a frothy chocolate drink.\n\nAncient Mesoamericans believed chocolate was an energy booster and aphrodisiac with mystical and medicinal qualities. The Mayans, who considered cacao a gift from the gods, used chocolate for sacred ceremonies and funeral offerings. Wealthy Mayans drank foaming chocolate drinks, while commoners consumed chocolate in a cold porridge-like dish.\n\nAs people of the Aztec empire spread across Mesoamerica in the 1400s, they too began to prize cacao. Since they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t grow it in the dry highlands of central Mexico, they traded with the Mayans for the beans, which they even used as currency. (In the 1500s, Aztecs could purchase a turkey hen or a hare for 100 beans.) By one account, the 16th-century Aztec ruler Moctezuma II drank 50 cups of chocolate a day out of a golden goblet to increase his libido.\n\nWATCH: Season 1 of The Food That Built America without signing in now.\n\nSpaniards Introduce Chocolate to Europe\xe2\x80\x99s Elite\n\nChocolate arrived in Europe during the 1500s, likely brought by both Spanish friars and conquistadors who had traveled to the Americas. Although the Spanish sweetened the bitter drink with cane sugar and cinnamon, one thing remained unchanged: Chocolate reigned as a delectable symbol of luxury, wealth and power\xe2\x80\x94an expensive import sipped by royal lips, and affordable only to Spanish elites.\n\nChocolate\xe2\x80\x99s popularity eventually spread to other European courts, where aristocrats consumed it as a magic elixir with health benefits. To slake their growing thirst for chocolate, European powers established colonial plantations in equatorial regions around the world to grow cacao and sugar. When diseases brought by Europeans depleted the native Mesoamerican labor pool, African slaves were imported to the Americas to work on the plantations and maintain chocolate production.\n\nChocolate remained an aristocratic nectar until the 1828 invention of the cocoa press revolutionized its production. Attributed in varying accounts to either Dutch chemist Coenraad Johannes van Houten or his father, Casparus, the cocoa press squeezed the fatty butter from roasted cacao beans, leaving behind a dry cake that could be pulverized into a fine powder that could be mixed with liquids and other ingredients, poured into molds and solidified into edible, easily digestible chocolate. The cocoa press ushered in the modern era of chocolate by enabling it to be used as a confectionary ingredient, and the resulting drop in production costs made chocolate much more affordable.\n\nREAD MORE: Why the Candy Bar Market Exploded After WWI\n\nChocolate Becomes a Treat for the Masses\n\n10 Gallery 10 Images\n\nIn 1847, British chocolate company J.S. Fry & Sons created the first edible chocolate bar from cocoa butter, cocoa powder and sugar. Rival chocolatier Cadbury\xe2\x80\x99s, credited with pioneering the Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day chocolate box and chocolate Easter egg, followed suit soon after and in 1854 earned a royal warrant as purveyors of chocolate to Queen Victoria.\n\nIt was in Switzerland that chocolate production took one of its greatest leaps forward. In the 1870s, Swiss chocolatier Daniel Peter utilized a powdered milk developed several years earlier by his neighbor Henri Nestl\xc3\xa9 to produce the first milk chocolate bar, and the pair eventually formed the Nestl\xc3\xa9 Company. Swiss chocolatier Rodolphe Lindt\xe2\x80\x99s 1879 invention of the conching machine\xe2\x80\x94which used large stone rollers to mix and aerate chocolate to give it a velvety texture and superior taste\xe2\x80\x94allowed for the mass production of smooth, creamy milk chocolate.\n\nIn the United States, Milton Hershey pioneered the assembly-line production of milk chocolate. After selling his caramel candy company for $1 million and producing his first milk chocolate bar in 1900, Hershey bought farmland near his birthplace in rural Pennsylvania and built an entire factory town devoted to chocolate. The grass-fed Holsteins on the surrounding dairy farms supplied the company\xe2\x80\x99s milk, and a company town in Cuba supplied its sugar.\n\nREAD MORE: How Hershey's Chocolate Helped Power Allied Troops in WWII\n\nChocolate bars soared in popularity during the Roaring Twenties. By the end of the decade, more than 40,000 different candy bars were being made in the U.S., according to Susan Benjamin, candy historian and author of Sweet as Sin: The Unwrapped Story of How Candy Became America\xe2\x80\x99s Favorite Pleasure. Father-and-son duo Frank C. Mars and Forrest Mars Sr. collaborated on the idea for the Milky Way bar, which hit the market in 1923 with the chocolate for its coating supplied by Hershey\xe2\x80\x99s. The family-owned business would rival Hershey\xe2\x80\x99s, and Forrest Mars Sr. later partnered with the son of a Hershey\xe2\x80\x99s executive to begin production of M&M candies in 1941.\n\nH.B. Reese, who had worked as a dairy farmer and shipping foreman for Hershey\xe2\x80\x99s, launched his own candy company in 1923 and five years later introduced Reese\xe2\x80\x99s Peanut Butter Cups. They later came to be produced by Hershey\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94and one of the top-selling candies in the United States.\n\nFrom its roots more than 5,000 years ago, chocolate has become a big business. According to research by Statista, retail sales of chocolate worldwide in 2016 totaled nearly $100 billion, including almost $25 billion in the United States alone. While the cacao plant is native to the Americas, its cultivation has now shifted to Africa, which is now the source of more than two-thirds of worldwide cocoa production.\n\nWATCH: Full episodes of The Food That Built America online now.""";"Other";"330.txt-Other"

"358.txt";"b'Cocoa butter composition\n\nPrior to any refining, the fatty-acid composition of the CB used in this study was determined by gas-liquid chromatography. The CB used in this study is mainly composed of stearic acid (37.3%), palmitic acid (25.4%), and oleic acid (33.5%) (Supplementary Table 1), which closely matches typical literature values4. The phosphorus content of the unrefined CB is 88 \xc2\xb1 1 ppm, or 0.263 \xc2\xb1 0.004% equivalent phosphatides by weight (Supplementary Table 2), which is similar to the 0.34 \xc2\xb1 0.07% reported by Arruda and Dimick6. After refining, the phospholipids are completely removed from the CB. The FFA content of the unrefined CB is 1.65 \xc2\xb1 0.01% (as oleic acid) (Supplementary Table 3), which complies with the requirement of having <1.75% FFAs as oleic acid in Codex standards. This is reduced to 0.06% after neutralization and bleaching.\n\nCrystal structure and polymorphism\n\nPowder X-ray diffraction is the most unambiguous method for determining CB TAG polymorphism. In this study, CB samples were melted at 80 \xc2\xb0C for 30 min to clear the memory of crystallization and then crystallized statically at 23 \xc2\xb0C in an incubator for 1 day. Form IV displays wide-angle reflections corresponding to short spacings of 4.35, 4.15, 3.97, and 3.81 \xc3\x85, Form V has short spacings of 4.58, 3.98, 3.87, 3.75, and 3.67 \xc3\x85, while Form VI has short spacings of 4.59, 3.86, and 3.70 \xc3\x8510. Unrefined CB displays reflections corresponding to short spacings of 4.61, 3.88, and 3.71 \xc3\x85, which is characteristic of Form VI, matching literature values closely (Fig. 1; Supplementary Table 4)10. Additionally, the small-angle reflections corresponding to long spacings of 68.16 and 32.89 \xc3\x85 further suggest a Form VI polymorphism and a 3 L structure (polytype)11. CB TAGs in Forms V and VI stack as lamellae in the [001] direction with a dimension, which is proportional to three fatty-acid chain lengths, hence the nomenclature \xe2\x80\x9c3 L\xe2\x80\x9d. Other polymorphic forms stack as 2 L structures, the more common polytypic arrangement12.\n\nFig. 1: Powder X-ray diffraction patterns and differential scanning calorimetric traces (inset) of unrefined native CB, refined CB, and refined CB with added minor lipidic components. Samples included a unrefined native CB, b refined CB, c refined CB with added 0.1% (w/w) dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, and d refined CB with added 0.1% (w/w) dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine. Samples were crystallized statically at 23 \xc2\xb0C for 24 h. Full size image\n\nIn contrast, the refined CB sample displays a pattern that resembles a blend of Forms IV and V. Short spacings of 4.35 and 4.18 \xc3\x85 agree with literature values for Form IV, while 4.60, 3.99, 3.88, and 3.77 \xc3\x85 match those of Form V11. Furthermore, the long spacings include both 2 L (45.20 \xc3\x85) and 3 L (65.57 and 32.69 \xc3\x85) arrangements, indicative of the presence of Forms IV and V, respectively11. Thus, it appears that the removal of minor components in CB through refining drastically changes the crystal structure of CB.\n\nThe wide-angle region of powder XRD spectra of refined CB with minor components added back is generally characteristic of Form V, or a blend of Forms IV and V (Fig. 1c, d and Supplementary Fig. 1 (a\xe2\x80\x93f)). In the small-angle region, diffraction patterns suggest that the 3 L structure is present in all samples. Long spacings in the range 64\xe2\x80\x9368 \xc3\x85 correspond to the reflections of the (001) crystal plane. Higher-order reflections, up to ones corresponding to the (009) plane of this lamellar crystal, are also evident. However, there is also varying amounts of the 2 L structure present in the various samples, specifically Form IV, which imparts undesirable properties and stability to CB and chocolate, including a low melting point and excessive softness12. The DMPC, GMP, GMO, and FFA samples have little to no 2 L structure present, indicated by the lack of a (001) plane reflection corresponding to ~45 \xc3\x85. In contrast, DPPE and GMS CB samples display a strong 2 L reflection, suggesting a mixture of 2 L and 3 L structures.\n\nMelting point and enthalpy of fusion\n\nThe melting points and enthalpies of fusion determined by DSC were compared across the CB samples and are shown in Table 1. Example DSC curves are presented for each sample in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2. Wille and Lutton reported the melting temperatures for Forms I through VI as 17.3, 23.3. 25.5, 27.5, 33.9, and 36.3 \xc2\xb0C10, while Lovegren et al.13 reported lower melting temperatures for the same six polymorphs as 13, 20, 23, 25, 30, and 33.5 \xc2\xb0C. The melting point of the unrefined CB used in our study closely matches that of Form VI, as reported by Willie and Lutton10. However, once the CB is refined, the melting point drops to 28.8 \xc2\xb0C, indicative of Form IV. After adding specific minor components back into the refined CB, the melting temperature increases again. Phospholipid and MAG addition to refined CB yield samples with melting points in the range of 29.8\xe2\x80\x9332.2 \xc2\xb0C, suggesting that the CB crystals are in transition from Form IV to Form V, as reported by Wille and Lutton10. Finally, when FFAs are added to refined CB, the melting temperature increases back to about 34 \xc2\xb0C, which may indicate a mixture of Forms V and VI, as it is also similar to Form VI\xe2\x80\x99s melting point of 33.5 \xc2\xb0C13. These results are all in agreement with the XRD data.\n\nTable 1 Melting point and enthalpy of fusion of unrefined native CB, refined CB, and refined CB with added minor lipidic components. Full size table\n\nThe enthalpies of fusion follow a similar trend, with a higher enthalpy of fusion (143.9 J/g) for unrefined CB, which decreases significantly after refining (110.9 J/g). Again, the phospholipids and MAGs have a much smaller effect, if any, compared to the FFAs. With the FFA samples, the enthalpies of fusion are similar to that of the unrefined CB. Guthrie reported an enthalpy of 147 J/g for Form V CB, which decreased for less stable forms14.\n\nCrystallization kinetics\n\nThe crystallization kinetics of the CB samples were quantified using half-times derived from the Avrami model fitted to the SFC-temperature data, as shown in Fig. 2, with the calculated Avrami constants shown in Supplementary Table 515.\n\nFig. 2: Static crystallization growth curve of unrefined native CB, refined CB, and refined CB with added minor lipidic components crystallized at 23 \xc2\xb0C (symbols) and corresponding fits to the Avrami model (solid lines). The inset table indicates the half-times of crystallization derived form model fits. Refining CB accelerates its crystallization (a), as does 0.1% (w/w) phospholipid addition (b). Addition of 0.5% (w/w) saturated monoacylglycerols, glycerol monostearate, and glycerol monopalmitate, do not significantly affect crystallization kinetics, while addition of the unsaturated glycerol monooletate does (c). Free fatty-acid addition to refined CB at 0.5% (w/w) levels accelerates crystallization for stearic, palmitic, and oleic acids equally (d). Values represent means and standard errors of three replicates and values with the same superscript letter are not significantly different (P > 0.05). Full size image\n\nUnrefined CB has the longest half-time of crystallization at 281.9 min, which decreases to 202.3 min after refining. Statistically significant decreases (P < 0.05) in the half time of crystallization of unrefined CB are observed after addition of DMPC, DPPE, GMO, and all free fatty acids tested, including palmitic, stearic, and oleic acids. Chaiseri and Dimick reported that different phospholipids had different effects on crystallization rate, with certain phospholipids such as lysophosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol retarding nucleation, while others such as phosphatidylcholine promoting nucleation. They also highlighted that removing phospholipids through refining decreased the crystallization rate, indicating that phospholids may be necessary as initial crystallization seeds in CB1. This agrees with the data presented in this study, with the addition of phospholipids increasing crystallization rate. Arruda and Dimick reported a much higher relative concentration of phospholipids in seed crystals than in bulk CB, with the majority being phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine6. Thus, it appears that the added phospholipids may aid in the nucleation of CB TAGs.\n\nThe FFA and GMO CB samples have a slightly shorter half-time of crystallization relative to the refined CB sample, but the effects of palmitic and oleic acid are not statistically significant (P > 0.05). M\xc3\xbcller and Careglio focused their study specifically on FFAs, and reported slower crystal growth of unrefined CB with added stearic, palmitic, and oleic acids7. However, we do not observe this in our study. Chaiseri and Dimick reported that saturated free fatty acids increased the crystallization rate in the early stages of CB crystallization1.\n\nFew studies have been conducted on the effect of MAGs on CB crystallization. Chaiseri and Dimick suggested that their effects are small due to their low concentration in CB1. In our study, GMS and GMP, both saturated monoglycerides, do not significantly affect CB crystallization kinetics. Surprisingly, the unsaturated monoglyceride GMO enhances CB crystallization.\n\nPolarized light microscopy\n\nLight microscopy revealed subtle differences in the microstructure of the different CB samples (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 3). Although all images display feather-like spherulitic structures, the unrefined sample has smaller spherulites. DPPE addition, interestingly, leads to the formation of larger spherulites with a different texture than upon DMPC addition. The spherulites of the refined and DPPE samples display granular structures in the centre of the spherulites and feather-like crystallites in the periphery. The MAG samples all exhibit similar crystal morphologies, with both granular structures and small feather-like spherulites present. This is similar to the stearic and palmitic acid samples, though the FFA samples display a more granular structure. It appears that the MAG and FFA samples, excluding the oleic acid sample, revert the CB to the morphology of the unrefined sample. However, the oleic acid sample differs greatly from the rest, displaying large spherulites analogous to the refined CB sample.\n\nFig. 3: Polarized light microscopy images of unrefined native CB, refined CB, and refined CB with and without added minor lipidic components. Samples included a unrefined native CB, b refined CB, c refined CB with added 0.1% (w/w) dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, and d refined CB with added 0.1% (w/w) dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine. Samples were crystallized statically at 23 \xc2\xb0C for 24 h. Intensity and contrast were auto-levelled. Full size image\n\nAn aspect that became clear during the microscopy studies is that the spatial distribution of mass of CB is affected by the refining process and subsequent addition of minor lipidic components. One way to quantify this spatial distribution of mass is by determining the box-counting fractal dimension (D box ) of the images. A high fractal dimension is associated with a greater fill of the available embedding space with crystalline mass, as well as a higher order in the distribution of this crystalline mass. The box-counting fractal dimension provides a value that quantifies the level of space-filling, as well as self-similarity within a structure, which can be related to the nucleation process of CB. Supplementary Table 6 lists these values. The unrefined and stearic acid samples have the lowest average fractal dimension, with D box = 1.63 and 1.62, respectively. In contrast, the sample with the highest fractal dimension is the refined sample at D box = 1.75, followed by the phospholipid samples at ~1.72. Samples with a higher fractal dimension are expected to have originated from a higher nucleation rate, as this leads to more homogenous growth across an area. On the other hand, slower nucleation rates would result in more heterogeneous growth, leading to a lower fractal dimension for the resulting mass distribution 16.\n\nInterestingly, here we also discovered a statistically significant (r = 0.77, P < 0.01) inverse correlation between the melting temperature of the samples and their fractal dimension, as shown in Fig. 4. This may be related to the polymorphism of each sample and its corresponding nucleation process. For the unrefined sample, a high melting temperature of 36.4 \xc2\xb0C indicates the presence of the Form VI polymorph. The higher free energy of nucleation for this most stable polymorph results in low nucleation rates, leading to a more heterogeneous mass distribution and a lower fractal dimension. Conversely, the lower melting temperature of the refined sample suggests a mixture of Forms IV and V, which are metastable polymorphs. These polymorphic forms have greater rates of nucleation, resulting in a more homogeneous mass distribution and a higher fractal dimension16.\n\nFig. 4: Global relationship between the box-counting fractal dimension (D box ) of polarized light microscopy images of CB samples and their corresponding melting temperature (T m ). Fractal dimension values plotted represent the means of six images, while melting temperature values plotted represent the means of three replicates. Full size image\n\nMechanical properties\n\nThe hardness of both CB and chocolate samples containing some of the minor components was determined by 3-point bending, and the elastic bending modulus calculated. The elastic bending moduli (E B ) of unrefined CB, refined CB, and DMPC CB are 44.1 \xc2\xb1 3.4, 35.4 \xc2\xb1 4.4, and 39.0 \xc2\xb1 3.7 N/mm2, respectively. There is no statistically significant difference between these values (P > 0.05). The melting temperatures for these samples are the same as well, with the average being 34.3 \xc2\xb1 0.1 \xc2\xb0C.\n\nFor the chocolate samples, the addition of phospholipids to molten commercial chocolate (90% cocoa solids) allows the chocolate to maintain hardness without complex tempering procedures, such as crystallization at 5 \xc2\xb0C for 1 h and subsequent storage at 20 \xc2\xb0C for 4 days. Other trials with static crystallization at 23 and 26 \xc2\xb0C yield chocolates with undesirable mechanical and surface properties, suggesting that the use of phospholipids to promote proper tempering still requires some optimization of crystallization temperatures. DMPC and DPPE were added chocolate at 0.1% (w/w) levels, and their properties were compared to commercial chocolate both directly from the package and recrystallized under the same conditions as the doped samples (Table 2). The E B is similar between the commercial chocolate and the phospholipid-containing samples, but is significantly lower for the recrystallized commercial chocolate (P < 0.05). When the chocolate is melted and recrystallized without any additive addition, it becomes much softer. A greater E B indicates a stiffer chocolate, relating to the property of snap, which is desirable in chocolate. However, DSC analysis revealed that all the chocolate samples have similar melting temperatures, all indicative of Form V CB crystals. XRD patterns further confirm the presence of Form V CB crystals in all samples (Fig. 5). Thus, it appears that the polymorphism of CB in chocolate does not wholly determine its mechanical properties, and these mechanical properties may be attributed to the microstructure instead.\n\nTable 2 Elastic bending modulus (E B ), melting temperature, and whiteness index (WI) of commercial chocolate samples with added phospholipids. Full size table\n\nFig. 5: Powder X-ray diffraction patterns for commercial chocolate with added minor lipidic components. Chocolate samples were molten, blended with the minor components and crystallized at 5 \xc2\xb0C for 1 h, followed by 20 \xc2\xb0C for 4 days. The a commercial chocolate, b molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate, c molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added 0.1% (w/w) dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, and d molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added 0.1% (w/w) dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine, all display powder X-ray diffraction patterns characteristic of well-tempered \xce\xb2 2 , triclinic, Form V cocoa butter crystals. This crystal form displays a strong reflection corresponding to a short spacing of ~4.6 \xc3\x85 in the wide-angle diffraction region, and characteristic wide-angle reflections in the 2\xce\xb8 region 20\xe2\x80\x9325\xc2\xb0. In the small-angle diffraction region, only reflections from the 3 L (001) plane corresponding to ~62\xe2\x80\x9363-\xc3\x85 were observed. The absence of reflections from (001) plane of the 2 L polytype indicates the formation of the optimal polytypic form in the cocoa butter in all samples. Reflections at higher angles in the small-angle region correspond to higher-order reflections for these two crystal planes. Full size image\n\nProper chocolate tempering typically focuses on the melting behavior of the chocolate, in other words, the polymorphism of the chocolate\xe2\x80\x99s CB triacylglycerol crystals2,3. However, there is little consideration for the microstructure and mechanical properties when determining whether chocolate has been properly tempered or not. Here we show that addition of DMPC and DPPE helps achieve the desired hardness and fracture properties in chocolate, without directly impacting the polymorphism. This likely results from changes in the microstructure of the underlying CB fat crystal network, which arises from the phospholipids affecting the nucleation behavior of the CB.\n\nSurface reflectance\n\nProper tempering of chocolate results in a smooth surface with high surface gloss17. Bloom, for example, is often characterized by the appearance of a grayish white film on the surface of chocolate, attributed to the uncontrolled polymorphic transformation from Form V to Form VI18. This white appearance is due to the presence of large surface crystals, which scatter light impinging upon them19. This can be quantified using the Whiteness Index (WI), calculated from RGB surface color measurements17. A higher WI indicates a greater level of fat bloom on the surface of the chocolate, or may also indicate a rougher surface. The WI for each of the chocolate samples is shown in Table 2. The commercial chocolate and the DMPC chocolate sample have similar WI, suggesting a properly tempered chocolate for the DMPC sample. Moreover, a statistically significant difference is evident between the DMPC chocolate sample and the recrystallized commercial chocolate sample (P < 0.05), which was not tempered properly. The lower WI of the DMPC chocolate sample suggests that the addition of this phospholipid aided in the stability of the chocolate, resulting in less fat bloom and/or a smoother surface compared to the recrystallized commercial chocolate sample. The effect of DPPE addition to molten and recrystallized chocolate is not as clear since the WI is not statistically different from the commercial, DMPC or molten and recrystallized chocolates.\n\nChocolate microstructure by synchrotron-based micro-computed tomography (SR-\xc2\xb5CT)\n\nSynchrotron \xc2\xb5CT analysis revealed similarities between chocolate microstructure among all samples imaged at a <450 \xc2\xb5m length scale. CT voxel intensity is directly proportional to material density. The number of voxels with a given intensity is then representative of the number of volume fractions with a given density in the analyzed volume. The molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate sample (Lindt-R) displays the largest difference between samples, with a narrowing and shift of the histogram compared to the fresh commercial chocolate (Lindt-F), molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added DMPC, and molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added DPPE. This indicates a difference in material structure upon recrystallization. This is visually represented in volume renderings where the most notable difference is a reduction in the green intensity for Lindt-R, compared to the Lindt-F, DMPC, and DPPE samples, as seen in Fig. 6. Volume rendering movies of each sample can be seen in the corresponding links in Fig. 6.\n\nFig. 6: Volume renderings of reconstructed slices, plotted histograms, and correlation matrix of SR-\xc2\xb5CT data. Samples included a molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added 0.1% (w/w) dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC), Supplementary Movie 1; b molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added 0.1% (w/w) dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DPPE), Supplementary Movie 2; c fresh commercial chocolate (Lindt-F), Supplementary Movie 3; d molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate (Lindt-R), Supplementary Movie 4; e plotted histograms, and f correlation matrix. Full size image\n\nA comparison of the histograms shows qualitative differences in the overall density distributions, which make up the sample volumes in the images. A correlation matrix was generated by inputting the voxel count values for each binned 16-bit gray-value and generating a table of correlation coefficients between the four chocolates density distributions. The correlation matrices show a high positive correlation in the material\xe2\x80\x99s density distribution regardless of treatment; however, the least variance is observed between DMPC vs. Lindt-F and DPPE vs. Lindt-F. The highest correlation coefficient is found between DMPC and fresh Lindt, and DPPE vs. fresh Lindt samples, with a value of 0.9987. This suggests that the complex microstructure of Lindt chocolate with added DMPC and DPPE and crystallized isothermally, is more similar to that of tempered fresh Lindt chocolate than without these additives.\n\nOverall, we find that the presence of various minor components within CB results in major changes to its polymorphism, crystallization kinetics, and crystal morphology. By refining CB through neutralization and bleaching, the unrefined CB transitioned from Form VI to a blend of Forms IV and V, in addition to displaying faster crystal growth. Although adding MAGs and FFAs back into refined CB results in some small differences, phospholipid addition has the largest impact.\n\nAt 0.1% (w/w) levels, DMPC and DPPE both significantly increase the crystal growth rate of refined CB. However, the DPPE sample exhibits significant amounts of the 2 L polytype, while the DMPC sample only displays 3 L polytypism, which is the more stable and preferred nanostructure. When added to a commercial chocolate sample, DMPC and DPPE both template the Form V polymorph with optimal mechanical properties, surface gloss and microstructure. This may allow for the production of chocolate products without the need for laborious and complex tempering protocols.\n\nProper tempering is often judged by the resulting melting temperature, a function of the CB polymorphic form2. However, as we show in this study, the various chocolate samples were all in Form V as determined by DSC and XRD analysis, but display different mechanical properties. This suggests that there is more to tempering than achieving the Form V polymorph, and important qualities such as gloss and snap may be heavily dependent on surface and bulk microstructure. Thus, DMPC, DPPE, and possibly other saturated phospholipids can potentially be employed as effective additives for engineering the crystallization behavior, polymorphism, nanostructure, and microstructure in CB and chocolate products.'";"Other";"358.txt-Other"
"366.txt";"b'Is chocolate toxic to dogs?\n\nYes, chocolate is toxic to dogs. While rarely fatal, chocolate ingestion can result in significant illness. Chocolate is toxic because it contains a chemical called theobromine, as well as caffeine. Theobromine is the main toxin in chocolate and is very similar to caffeine. Both chemicals are used medicinally as a diuretic, heart stimulant, blood vessel dilator, and a smooth muscle relaxant. Dogs cannot metabolize theobromine and caffeine as well as people can. That is why dogs are more sensitive to the chemicals\xe2\x80\x99 effects.\n\nHow much chocolate is poisonous to a dog?\n\nThe amount of toxic theobromine varies with the type of chocolate. The darker and more bitter the chocolate, the more dangerous it is to dogs. Baking chocolate and gourmet dark chocolate are highly concentrated and contain 130-450 mg of theobromine per ounce. Common milk chocolate only contains about 44-58 mg/ounce. White chocolate rarely poses any threat of chocolate poisoning with only 0.25 mg of theobromine per ounce of chocolate. Even if the amount ingested is not a toxicity concern, dogs can still become ill from the fat and sugar in chocolate. These can cause pancreatitis in severe cases or in dogs that have more sensitive stomachs. To put this in perspective, a medium-sized dog weighing 50 pounds would only need to eat 1 ounce of baker\'s chocolate, or 9 ounces of milk chocolate, to potentially show signs of poisoning. For many dogs, ingesting small amounts of milk chocolate is not harmful.\n\nWhat are the clinical signs of chocolate poisoning?\n\nClinical signs depend on the amount and type of chocolate ingested. For many dogs, the most common clinical signs are vomiting, diarrhea, increased thirst, panting or restlessness, excessive urination, and racing heart rate. In severe cases, symptoms can include muscle tremors, seizures, and heart failure. Complications such as developing aspiration pneumonia from vomiting, can make the prognosis for chocolate poisoning worse. When in doubt, immediate treatment by your veterinarian is recommended if a poisonous amount of chocolate is ingested.\n\n""Clinical signs of chocolate poisoning can take hours to develop and last for days.""\n\nClinical signs of chocolate poisoning can take several hours to develop. Signs due to large exposures can last for days due to the long half-life of theobromine. This means that it remains in the bloodstream for a longer period. Theobromine may be re-absorbed from the bladder, so intravenous fluids and frequent walks to encourage urination may be necessary. It is important to seek medical attention by calling your veterinarian or Pet Poison Helpline as soon as you suspect that your dog has eaten chocolate.\n\nWhat should I do if my dog eats chocolate?\n\nContact your veterinarian or Pet Poison Helpline to see if a poisonous amount of chocolate was ingested. If a toxic amount is ingested, you should have your dog examined by a veterinarian immediately. The sooner treatment begins, the better your dog\'s prognosis.\n\nWhat is the treatment for chocolate poisoning?\n\nTreatment depends on the amount and type of chocolate eaten. If treated early, decontamination including inducing vomiting and administering activated charcoal to prevent absorption of theobromine into the body may be all that is necessary. Treatments of activated charcoal may be repeated to reduce the continued resorption and recirculation of theobromine.\n\nIt is very common to provide supportive treatments such as intravenous fluid therapy to help stabilize a dog and promote theobromine excretion. All dogs ingesting a toxic amount of chocolate should be closely monitored for any signs of agitation, vomiting, diarrhea, nervousness, irregular heart rhythm, and high blood pressure. Medication to treat restlessness and other signs may also be necessary\n\nI saw a treat made for dogs that contains chocolate. Isn\'t this dangerous?\n\nMany gourmet dog treats use carob as a chocolate substitute.\n\n""Carob looks similar to chocolate and the two are often confused.""\n\nCarob looks similar to chocolate and the two are often confused. Some specialty dog bakeries will use a small amount of milk chocolate in treats. Since the amount of theobromine is typically low, this may be safe for most dogs. However, most veterinarians recommend that you avoid giving your dog chocolate in any form.\n\nPet Poison Helpline, an animal poison control center based out of Minneapolis, MN is available 24/7 for pet owners and veterinary professionals that require assistance treating a potentially poisoned pet. The staff provides treatment advice for poisoning cases of all species, including dogs, cats, birds, small mammals, large animals and exotic species. As the most cost-effective option for animal poison control care, Pet Poison Helpline\xe2\x80\x99s fee of $65 per incident includes follow-up consultations for the duration of the poison case.

"389.txt";"b'Chocolate is toxic to dogs, and depending on the type and amount of chocolate consumed and the weight of your dog, it could cause a serious medical emergency. If you know your dog has eaten chocolate, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to monitor him for signs of toxicity (see below), and it\xe2\x80\x99s recommended that you contact your veterinarian or the Pet Poison Helpline (855-213-6680, fee applies) for advice.\n\nLearn how much is too much, which types of chocolate are the most dangerous, and what signs to look for that may signal your dog needs treatment.\n\nWhy Chocolate Is Toxic to Dogs\n\nChocolate contains both theobromine and caffeine, both of which can speed the heart rate and stimulate the nervous system of dogs, the Merck/Merial Manual for Veterinary Health explains. The risk of your dog becoming sick from ingesting chocolate depends on the type and amount of chocolate consumed and the weight of the dog (calculate your dog\xe2\x80\x99s risk of toxicity with this easy-to-use program). The concentrations of these toxic substances vary among different types of chocolates. Here are a few types of chocolate listed in order of theobromine content:\n\nCocoa powder (most toxic) Unsweetened baker\xe2\x80\x99s chocolate Semisweet chocolate Dark chocolate Milk chocolate\n\nKnowing how much and what kind of chocolate your dog ate can help you and your vet determine if you have an emergency. In general, mild symptoms of chocolate toxicity occur when a dog consumes 20 mg of methylxanthines per kilogram of body weight. Cardiac symptoms of chocolate toxicity occur around 40 to 50 mg/kg, and seizures occur at dosages greater than 60 mg/kg.\n\nIn simpler terms, that means a very concerning dose of chocolate is approximately one ounce of milk chocolate per pound of body weight. Since an average Hershey\xe2\x80\x99s Milk Chocolate bar is 1.55 ounces, consuming even one chocolate bar can have serious consequences, especially for small dogs. Eating a crumb of chocolate cake or a very small piece of a chocolate bar, on the other hand, probably won\xe2\x80\x99t kill your dog, especially if it is a larger breed, but chocolate should never be fed as a treat.\n\nWhat are the Signs of Chocolate Poisoning?\n\nSigns of chocolate poisoning usually appear within 6 to 12 hours after your dog has eaten it, may last up to 72 hours, and include the following:\n\nVomiting\n\nDiarrhea\n\nRestlessness\n\nIncreased urination\n\nTremors\n\nElevated or abnormal heart rate\n\nSeizures\n\nCollapse and death\n\nNote: Older dogs and dogs with heart conditions are more at risk of sudden death from chocolate poisoning.\n\nWhat to Do If Your Dog Ate Chocolate\n\nIf you believe your dog ate chocolate, call your veterinarian immediately or call the Pet Poison Helpline (855-213-6680) for advice. Based on your dog\xe2\x80\x99s size and the amount and type of chocolate consumed, your veterinarian may recommend that you monitor your dog for the clinical signs listed above and call back if his condition worsens.\n\nIn other cases, the veterinarian may prefer you bring the dog into the clinic. If your pet consumed the chocolate less than two hours ago, your veterinarian may induce vomiting and give him several doses of activated charcoal, which works to move the toxins out of the body without being absorbed into the bloodstream. For more severe cases, veterinary intervention may be needed to provide supplemental treatment, such as medications or IV fluids, to resolve the effects of the poisoning. Dogs suffering from seizures may need to be monitored at the clinic overnight.\n\nHow to Prevent Your Dog from Eating Chocolate\n\nEven though small amounts of milk chocolate may not cause a problem in larger dogs, it\xe2\x80\x99s still not recommended that pet owners offer their dog chocolate as a treat. To prevent your dog from sneaking chocolate, follow these tips:\n\nPut it away: Make sure all chocolate items, including cocoa powder and hot chocolate mix, are stored where the dog cannot reach them, such as on a high shelf in a closed-door pantry. Remind your children and guests that chocolate should be kept out of the dog\xe2\x80\x99s reach and not left on countertops, tables, or in purses. Keep this in mind during the holidays, too, making sure to place trick-or-treat bags, Easter baskets, Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day candy, Christmas stockings, and Hanukkah coins (gelt), for example, in a place where a dog cannot get to them.\n\nTeach \xe2\x80\x9cleave it\xe2\x80\x9d: The command \xe2\x80\x9cleave it\xe2\x80\x9d is extremely effective in preventing dogs from eating something that falls onto the ground or is left within reach during a walk. It\xe2\x80\x99s also a very easy command to teach.\n\nCrate train your dog: The safest way to ensure your dog doesn\xe2\x80\x99t eat anything harmful while you\xe2\x80\x99re not supervising him is to crate train him. Find a sturdy crate that is large enough for your dog to stand up and turn around and make it a comfortable, safe place for him to retreat to when he wants to be alone or when you can\xe2\x80\x99t watch him.

"393.txt";"b""Many home chefs know that tempering chocolate to achieve a perfect finish and a satisfying 'snap' is no easy feat. Small variations in the quality of ingredients, temperature, mixing and timing can all set you up to fail, even when you learn from the best.\n\nThe results of a new study by food scientists from the University of Guelph in Canada suggest the addition of two common, naturally occurring fats \xe2\x80\x93 in the right proportions \xe2\x80\x93 might make chocolate tempering less of a gamble.\n\nPick up just about any block of milk chocolate from your local store, and you'll find it's more or less made out of the same things \xe2\x80\x93 cocoa butter for the form, cocoa mass (or chocolate liquor) for that familiar bitter taste, and additives like sugar or vanilla for sweetness and flavor.\n\nCrafting a solid bar of chocolate is a matter of encouraging the right size and distribution of crystals. In chocolate, crystalline forms of cocoa butter triglycerides (TAGs) are what give the food its characteristic shine, smooth texture, brittleness, and melting point.\n\nNot just any crystalline structure will do, either. Of the six distinct configurations of this class of molecule known to exist, Form V is the one that gives us a perfect temper.\n\nTempering \xe2\x80\x93 transforming the diverse mix of molecules into something that resists your bite while feeling heavenly smooth on your tongue \xe2\x80\x93 is a culinary process that has been gradually perfected over time, relying on a fine-tuned sequence of heating, mixing, and cooling.\n\nWhile researchers have investigated the influence TAG composition has on the success of tempering, little is known about how minor components of cocoa butter might make or break the process, including things like free fatty acids and phospholipids.\n\nGiven they make up just a few percent of the chemicals in cocoa butter, differences in their origins and refining might significantly alter the make-up of this key ingredient, either by helping the right crystals generate or interfering with their growth.\n\nPrevious research hinted at roles certain minor components had in the formation of the 'seed' crystals. For example, having a lot of free fatty acids seems to poison the crystallization process. Phospholipids, on the other hand, appeared to help them grow.\n\nTo nail down the precise proportions and chemical nature of these components, the researchers analyzed the exact make-up of a sample of cocoa butter, varying its composition by adding ingredients or bleaching out existing ones.\n\nThey then subjected it to a variety of tests to determine how variations in fat content might affect the growth time and proportion of crystal types, as well as things like melting point, surface reflection, micro-structure, and flex.\n\nWhile the amount of molecules such as free fatty acids had some effect, the real game-changer was the proportion of phospholipids, specifically saturated phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. Don't let the tongue-twister names fool you, though: these are garden variety biological molecules found in the membranes of living cells.\n\nBoth of these molecules in higher concentrations saw to the formation of Form V crystals, giving the cocoa butter the optimal glass, micro-structure, and mechanical properties.\n\nAdding the right amount of each to chocolate just might take the anxiety out of the tempering process, either by simplifying it or even eliminating it altogether.\n\nThis won't necessarily turn all of us into home kitchen dessertiers. But for professionals relying on recipes they can count on, knowing a little more about the chemistry of their chocolate creations just might give them the formula they need.\n\nThis research was published in Nature Communications.""";"Other";"393.txt-Other"

I had been wanting something sweet and since it was so hot outside, I decided I wanted ice cream. At the store, I saw the talenti pints of gelato and thought, ""how cute, I can reuse these."" I chose the coffee chocolate chip and I\'m so glad I did. It is creamy, has a full coffee flavor, and the chips are so thin and small they just melt away. I normally dislike chips in my frozen treats, but like I said, these just melted away nicely. My husband chose a the Belgian chocolate flavor and we were both disappointed with it compared to the coffee one. I ended up having to share mine with him which was fine since it is so rich I could only eat a little at a time.\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by DoctorEsq from Outstanding I have never been a coffee lover. Yes, in today\'s coffee addicted world that\'s strange but there you have it. I am, however, a tried and true Chocoholic. Yet the way Talenti has blended traditional coffee flavor with chocolate chips is truly outstanding. And the texture is perfect ~ a bit more solid then the other chocolate chip flavors especially in contrast to the Mediterranean Mint, Chocolate Chip, Peppermint Bark, etc ~ although all yummy, they melt far to quickly for my taste as I enjoy savoring the experience!! True, I pretty much love just about all the Talenti flavors and eat 1/2 a pint every night for my treat. But Talenti\'s Coffee Chocolate Chip has become one of my favorite flavors!\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by Auditory from This is what coffee flavor is all about In the mid-1960s when I was just a tot, my Sisters used to take me to a little shack that doubled as an ice cream parlor. The place featured a big name ice cream brand that is still one of the major players today. That\'s where I had my first taste of a coffee flavored frozen confection. Regrettably, the band name product today tastes nothing like I remembered it to have been. Fortunately, Talenti gelato has made that memory come back to life. With every spoonful, there is no guessing where the flavor is. Talenti has crafted a frozen dessert with an uncompromisingly strong coffee flavor that punches the tastebuds every time.\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by Kath12 from Delicious! My favorite ice cream flavor since I was young was Mocha. That flavor has disappeared. One night my daughter brought over brownies with a complimentary Talenti flavor. I fell in love with this gelato. Next time I went shopping I decided to buy the coffee with the chocolate chips. The first spoonful brought back the flavor I had longer for. It is now my nightly treat. All I need is 2-3 tablespoons full and I am totally satisfied until the next night. Sometimes I will mix it with one of your vanilla flavors & it is so yummy! No longer am I searching for this delicious flavor. I am totally hooked on Talenti brand gelato. I have enjoyed every flavor so far & I still have many more to try.\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by Baddie13 from Great Ice Cream This ice cream is delicious and is a great blend. I can taste the coffee and chocolate chips great together.\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by Mina from My life is now complete I was having a miserable day and I saw this in the store. Not much of a coffee person unless it\'s loaded with chocolate. Tried this as one of those what-the-hey-I\'ll-give-it-a-try moments and that first taste? [Insert angels singing here] DE-LOVIN-LICIOUS!!! The perfect amount of coffee taste, a ton of chocolate chips so no spoonful is left wanting, and my day got infinitely better after I downed half the jar in five minutes. Perfection in a jar. My only problem is trying to make it last before I can buy more! Yum yum yummy yummy yum! :D\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by best one so far from Best one so far Previous flavors I tried were super hard to open because they spilled gelato on the edge, making it extremely difficult to open. These were finally clean so it was easy to open. That was the first major PLUS in my book. Then I tried the gelato and was so impressed. It\'s the best coffee flavor I\'ve ever tasted. It\'s bolder than any other coffee flavored brands I\'ve tried so far. Normally I don\'t like ""stuff"" in my ice cream/gelato, but the ""chips"" in this one is more like shavings so it\'s not as noticeable (unlike their Double Dark Chocolate gelato which has chucks of chips).

Remove from the heat (reserve the saucepan of water) and immediately pour the peanut butter layer over the warm shortbread and use a small offset spatula to spread in an even layer. Transfer the pan to the refrigerator and refrigerate until the peanut butter layer is set, about 30 minutes.\n\nReturn the saucepan of water to a simmer for the chocolate layer . In a medium heat-proof bowl, combine the chocolate, corn syrup and butter. Cook, stirring, until the butter and chocolate have melted and the mixture is smooth. Remove from the heat and let cool for a few minutes, then remove the pan from the refrigerator and pour the chocolate mixture over the peanut butter layer, using the offset spatula to spread it into a thin layer that completely covers the peanut butter layer. Scatter the chopped peanuts over, then return to the refrigerator and refrigerate until the chocolate layer is set.\n\nTo serve: Remove the bars from the pan using the parchment paper to help lift. While the bars are still cool, use a sharp knife to cut the bars into 1-inch by 2-inch bars. Let come to room temperature before eating.'";"Other";"396.txt-Other"

"4.txt";"b'Chocolate is the most popular sweet treat in the world. People around the world (but mostly in Europe and the United States) consume more than 3 million tons of cocoa beans a year, according to the World Cocoa Foundation. And, not only does eating chocolate make you feel good, it may also be good for your heart and your brain.\n\nWhat is chocolate?\n\nChocolate is prepared from the fruit of the Theobroma cacao, a tropical tree whose name means ""food of the gods"" in Greek, according to ""Chocolate: Food of the Gods,"" an online exhibit by the Cornell University Library.\n\nTheobroma cacao trees are native to the Amazon and Orinoco river basins in South America. The trees are widely distributed from southeastern Mexico to the Amazon River. They thrive in hot, humid areas within about 20 degrees of the equator, according to Cornell. As the popularity of chocolate spread, growers established plantations in other regions, such as West Africa and South and Southeast Asia. Today, Ghana, C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire, Nigeria, Indonesia and Brazil account for 79 percent of the world\'s cacao production.\n\nCacao trees bear fruit that are about the same size and shape of a papaya, according to Patric Chocolate. These bumpy, lumpy berries, or pods, are full of up to 50 sour seeds, or beans, covered in white pulp.\n\nCacao seeds are harvested by hand because machines could injure the trees, according to Cornell. Workers remove the pods, which are orange when they are ripe, and open them with a machete. The seeds are placed in large fermentation trays that are stacked and covered in banana leaves, where they are left for two to seven days. Fermentation produces the chocolate flavor and aroma. It also destroys the seed\'s embryo, preventing unwanted germination, and causes the white pulp to fall away from the seeds.\n\nAfter fermenting, the beans dry out on sunny platforms. Workers turn them several times a day for three to five days to complete drying. The beans can dry faster in rotary driers but sun-dried beans taste the best, according to Cornell.\n\nNext, the beans are taken to the chocolate factory, where they are cleaned and debris is removed. The beans are roasted in large, rotating ovens. The roasting draws out flavor and removes the beans from their hulls. Roasted beans go into a winnowing machine, which cracks the beans and removes hulls. The remaining part of the bean is called the nib. Nibs become chocolate.\n\nThe nibs are ground down under a series of rollers. This process results in a thick paste called chocolate liquor. Chocolate liquor does not contain alcohol (however, chocolate liqueur does). It is the main source of unsweetened baking chocolate, according to Pam Williams, co-founder and past president of the Fine Chocolate Industry Association (FCIA) and founder and lead instructor of Ecole Cocolat Professional School of Chocolate Arts.\n\nAt this stage, the type of chocolate being produced is determined. According to the FCIA, ingredients separate fine chocolate from that of average quality. ""Fine chocolate,"" as designated by the FCIA, contains only cacao liquor, cacao butter (optional), sugar, lecithin, vanilla (optional) and possibly milk fats and solids. Additional flavors or ingredients like nuts can be added later.\n\n(Image credit: Dreamstime)\n\nTypes of chocolate\n\nFine chocolate falls into three categories: dark chocolate, milk chocolate and white chocolate, Williams said.\n\nDark chocolate has chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, lecithin, sugar and vanilla.\n\nMilk chocolate has all of the above plus milk fats and milk solids.\n\nWhite chocolate contains everything milk chocolate does except chocolate liquor.\n\nChocolatiers debate whether white chocolate is really chocolate. Until 2002, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration considered it a confectionary rather than chocolate because it does not contain chocolate liquor. The Hershey Food Corp. and the Chocolate Manufacturers Association petitioned the FDA, which added a standard of identity for white chocolate. Because the FDA refers to it as white chocolate, rather than confectionary, some experts, like Williams, accept white chocolate as chocolate.\n\nWithin the three categories, the FDA also acknowledges several grades, Williams said. They include unsweetened or brute, which can be up to 99 percent chocolate liquor; bittersweet; semisweet; and dark milk chocolate. The type of chocolate depends on what ingredients are present and the percentage of cocoa, in addition to where the beans are from and the way they are prepared.\n\nHealth benefits of chocolate\n\nGood heart food\n\nSeveral recent studies have examined the role that chocolate may have on heart health. Cacao beans are full of phytonutrients, which act as antioxidants and provide additional benefits. Furthermore, cacao beans are rich sources of iron, copper, magnesium, zinc and phosphorus, according to the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Dark chocolate contains two to three times more beneficial flavanols than milk chocolate because milk chocolate\'s cacao concentration is diluted with milk and possibly more sugar.\n\nWhile most studies have found some correlation between chocolate consumption and reduced risk of heart problems, the amount and type of chocolate needed requires further study. A 2017 meta-analysis of the effects of chocolate on coronary heart disease, stroke and diabetes published in the journal Nutrients concluded that the most benefit was associated with moderate chocolate intake. The authors found little benefit in heart disease or stroke reduction among people who consumed chocolate more than three times a week. Protective effects against diabetes emerged at two servings a week, but that benefit disappeared if people had more than six servings a week.\n\nOn the other hand, the findings of a large-scale study of more than 150,000 primarily male U.S. veterans who did not have coronary artery disease at the beginning of the study, suggest that eating an ounce of chocolate at least five times a week may help prevent the risk of coronary artery disease-related events like heart attack and heart failure.\n\nChocolate may also help prevent the development of atrial fibrillation, a type of irregular heartbeat that increases the risk of heart failure, stroke and more. A study, published in the journal Heart in 2017, found that adults who ate chocolate at least once a month had 10 to 20 percent lower rates of developing atrial fibrillation than those who never or rarely ate chocolate.\n\nGood brain food\n\nChocolate may be good for the brain. Some studies have focused on chocolate\'s ability to improve cognitive function. A study published in the Journal of Alzheimer\'s Disease in 2016 found that chocolate consumption might lower the risk of cognitive decline in older people. The study looked at nearly 400 Portuguese citizens over age 65 and saw that those who ate a moderate amount of chocolate \xe2\x80\x94 on average, one chocolate snack a week; the study did not differentiate between milk and dark chocolate \xe2\x80\x94 decreased their risk of cognitive decline by 40 percent over two years. Those who ate more chocolate, or those who had more caffeine, saw fewer cognitive benefits.\n\nGood mood food\n\nChocolate is often associated with positive effects on mood, but the reasons why it makes some people feel good are debatable. Chocolate contains substances that stimulate the brain in the same way cannabis does, such as anandamines, and substances that have similar effects as amphetamine, such as tyramine and phenylethylamine, according to the Dartmouth Undergraduate Journal of Science. However, these substances are in very low concentrations \xe2\x80\x94 too low to induce an antidepressant effect.\n\nChocolate may interact with neurotransmitter systems that contribute to appetite, reward and mood regulation, such as dopamine, serotonin and endorphins, according to the 2013 article in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology. However, the authors noted, the effects may have more to do with chocolate\'s taste and smell than its chemical effects.\n\nA 2010 study published in Archives of Internal Medicine found a link between depression and chocolate consumption. The results showed that people who scored high on a screening test for depression consumed more chocolate than those who weren\'t considered depressed. However, the study pointed out that there is only a link, and cannot explain why. Since the participants were not followed over time, the researchers don\'t know whether eating chocolate ameliorates or amplifies a sad mood. The possibilities are many \xe2\x80\x94 from using chocolate as a sort of natural Prozac to the idea that chocolate might have some role in driving depression.\n\nHealth risks of eating chocolate\n\nLike many foods, chocolate is healthiest when eaten in moderation. The sugars and fats that are added to chocolate make it high in calories, which may lead to weight gain. Furthermore, many of the protective effects that chocolate may offer might be mitigated by overconsumption.\n\nHistory of chocolate\n\nScientists debate how long humans have been using and consuming cacao beans. Chocolate\'s history goes back at least 2,000 years, while historians Sophie and Michael Coe, authors of ""The True History of Chocolate"" (Thames and Hudson, 2013), suggest that it might go back four millennia. The word chocolate can be traced back to the Aztec word ""xocoatl,"" the name for a bitter drink made from cacao beans. This was the way chocolate was consumed until the Spanish conquistadors came to Central America.\n\nIn several pre-Columbian Latin American societies, cacao beans were used as currency, according to Smithsonian magazine. Mayans and Aztecs believed the beans had mystical properties and used them during important rituals. When the Spanish arrived, sweetened chocolate came into existence. Legend has it that the Aztec king Montezuma gave conquistador Hern\xc3\xa1n Cort\xc3\xa9s a bitter chocolate drink, which he said was disgusting. But Cort\xc3\xa9s\' men added cane sugar and honey to it and took it back to Spain, where it quickly became popular.\n\nChocolate was a fashionable drink for rich Europeans throughout the 18th century. The Industrial Revolution allowed chocolate to be mass-produced and brought the treat to the masses. The popularity led to the development of cacao tree plantations.\n\nEnslaved people farmed most of the plantations. Initially, Spanish colonizers forced Mesoamericans to farm the cacao plantations, according to ""The Biography of Chocolate"" (Crabtree Publishing Co., 2005), by Adrianna Morganelli. When the indigenous peoples began to die in large numbers from diseases brought by Europeans, enslaved Africans were brought over to make up the labor shortage. In addition to sugarcane, indigo and other crops, enslaved Africans planted, maintained and harvested cacao trees throughout the Caribbean, Central and South America to feed the new European taste for chocolate.\n\nIn 1815, Dutch physicist Coenraad Van Houten experimented with removing varied amounts of the cocoa butter from chocolate liquor, according to Cornell University. This led to the creation of cocoa powder and soon solid chocolate.\n\nIn 1847, a Bristol, England, chocolate company, Fry\'s, created the first mass-produced chocolate bar when Joseph Fry added additional cocoa butter to Van Houten\'s chocolate, which turned it into a moldable paste, according to Bristol Museums. Milk chocolate was invented soon after with the help of Henri Nestl\xc3\xa9, who went on to found the major food company that bears his name. Major European chocolate brands Lindt and Cadbury also got their start in the 1800s; Rodolphe Lindt invented the conching machine, which gives chocolate a velvety texture.\n\nMass chocolate consumption hit the United States in the late 1800s when Milton S. Hershey began selling chocolate-coated caramels. He then developed his own formula for milk chocolate, purchased chocolate factory equipment and introduced mass-produced chocolate bars and other shapes, like Hershey\'s Kisses, in 1900.\n\nIn 1923, the Mars Co. developed the Milky Way bar by putting nougat inside a chocolate bar. That same year, former Hershey employee H.B. Reese introduced Reese\'s Peanut Butter Cups, which later became part of the Hershey brand.\n\nAs the years progressed, chocolate concoctions from both small and large producers became increasingly innovative. In September 2017, Swiss chocolate company Barry Callebaut introduced ruby chocolate. Ruby chocolate comes from isolating specific compounds in cocoa beans, according to Confectionary News. That, along with a modified processing technique, results in a rosy pink chocolate that has a sweet but sour berry taste and no traditional chocolate flavor, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. Other colored chocolates are made from dyed white chocolate.\n\nThreats to chocolate\n\nChocolate production is threatened by climate change. According to a 2016 report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the primary cacao-producing countries of C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire, Ghana, and Indonesia will experience a 2.1 degree Celsius (3.7 degrees Fahrenheit) increase in temperature by 2050. Rainfall will not rise along with the temperature, causing lowered humidity levels. As a result, viable land for cacao production will significantly shrink. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\'s Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability report, 89.5 percent of the 294 chocolate-producing locations studied would become less suitable by 2050.\n\nFarmers and scientists are working to develop strategies to maintain chocolate production. Some farmers are planting taller trees next to cacao trees to increase shade and decrease moisture loss, according to the NOAA. Cacao plantations may also move to higher elevations with cooler temperatures and greater rainfall.\n\nGenetic scientists are taking a different approach. A January 2018 press release from the Innovative Genomics Institute announced a project to develop disease-resistant cacao. Condensing cacao plantations because of climate change could increase the spread of disease. The project will use CRISPR DNA-editing technology to make a heartier cacao seed.\n\nEthics of chocolate production\n\nAccording to Slave Free Chocolate, 2.3 million children work in chocolate production in Ghana and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire, where they are vulnerable to trafficking, slavery and other violent labor practices. The International Labor Rights Forum reports that these children are often exposed to chemicals, work long hours and are denied education. According to Epicure and Culture, many children are sold into slavery and never see their families again. Others are kidnapped.\n\nThough the Harkin-Engel Protocol of 2001 was designed to stop child labor in the chocolate industry, according to the CNN Freedom Project, little has changed. The deadlines for action have been repeatedly pushed back.\n\nConsumers who want ethical chocolate should look for certifications designating Fair Trade, Rain Forest Alliance, UTZ, and Fair for Life, according to Slave Free Chocolate\xe2\x80\x99s guide to chocolate companies.\n\nChocolate production can also harm the environment. Farmers often clear forests to make room for cacao plantations. According to the World Wildlife Fund, about 70 percent of C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire\'s illegal deforestation is related to cacao farming. One danger of deforestation is soil erosion, which can make land less fertile for cacao plants, creating a vicious cycle, according to Confectionary News.\n\nAdditional resources'";"Other";"4.txt-Other"
"401.txt";"b'Food produced from the seed of Theobroma cacao\n\nChocolate is a food product made from roasted and ground cacao pods, that is available as a liquid, solid or paste, on its own or as a flavoring agent in other foods. Cacao has been consumed in some form since at least the Olmec civilization (19th-11th century BCE),[1][2] and the majority of Mesoamerican people - including the Maya and Aztecs - made chocolate beverages.[3]\n\nThe seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor. After fermentation, the beans are dried, cleaned, and roasted. The shell is removed to produce cocoa nibs, which are then ground to cocoa mass, unadulterated chocolate in rough form. Once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating, it is called chocolate liquor. The liquor may also be cooled and processed into its two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter. Baking chocolate, also called bitter chocolate, contains cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions, without any added sugar. Powdered baking cocoa, which contains more fiber than cocoa butter, can be processed with alkali to produce dutch cocoa. Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, a combination of cocoa solids, cocoa butter or added vegetable oils, and sugar. Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder or condensed milk. White chocolate contains cocoa butter, sugar, and milk, but no cocoa solids.\n\nChocolate is one of the most popular food types and flavors in the world, and many foodstuffs involving chocolate exist, particularly desserts, including cakes, pudding, mousse, chocolate brownies, and chocolate chip cookies. Many candies are filled with or coated with sweetened chocolate. Chocolate bars, either made of solid chocolate or other ingredients coated in chocolate, are eaten as snacks. Gifts of chocolate molded into different shapes (such as eggs, hearts, coins) are traditional on certain Western holidays, including Christmas, Easter, Valentine\'s Day, and Hanukkah. Chocolate is also used in cold and hot beverages, such as chocolate milk and hot chocolate, and in some alcoholic drinks, such as creme de cacao.\n\nAlthough cocoa originated in the Americas, West African countries, particularly C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire and Ghana, are the leading producers of cocoa in the 21st century, accounting for some 60% of the world cocoa supply.\n\nWith some two million children involved in the farming of cocoa in West Africa, child slavery and trafficking were major concerns in 2018,[4][5] and continue to be. International attempts to improve conditions for children were doomed to failure because of persistent poverty, absence of schools, increasing world cocoa demand, more intensive farming of cocoa, and continued exploitation of child labor.[4]\n\nHistory\n\nMesoamerican usage\n\nTwo Mayans sit around a container of frothed chocolate.\n\nChocolate has been prepared as a drink for nearly all of its history. For example, one vessel found at an Olmec archaeological site on the Gulf Coast of Veracruz, Mexico, dates chocolate\'s preparation by pre-Olmec peoples as early as 1750 BC.[6] On the Pacific coast of Chiapas, Mexico, a Mokaya archaeological site provides evidence of cocoa beverages dating even earlier, to 1900 BC.[7][6] The residues and the kind of vessel in which they were found indicate the initial use of cocoa was not simply as a beverage, but the white pulp around the cocoa beans was likely used as a source of fermentable sugars for an alcoholic drink.[8]\n\nMan Carrying a Cacao Pod, 1440\xe2\x80\x931521. Volcanic stone, traces of red pigment. Aztec., 1440\xe2\x80\x931521. Volcanic stone, traces of red pigment. Brooklyn Museum\n\nAn early Classic-period (460\xe2\x80\x93480 AD) Mayan tomb from the site in Rio Azul had vessels with the Maya glyph for cocoa on them with residue of a chocolate drink, suggests the Maya were drinking chocolate around 400 AD.[9] Documents in Maya hieroglyphs stated chocolate was used for ceremonial purposes, in addition to everyday life.[10] The Maya grew cacao trees in their backyards,[11] and used the cocoa seeds the trees produced to make a frothy, bitter drink.[12]\n\nBy the 15th century, the Aztecs gained control of a large part of Mesoamerica and adopted cocoa into their culture. They associated chocolate with Quetzalcoatl, who, according to one legend, was cast away by the other gods for sharing chocolate with humans,[13] and identified its extrication from the pod with the removal of the human heart in sacrifice.[14] In contrast to the Maya, who liked their chocolate warm, the Aztecs drank it cold, seasoning it with a broad variety of additives, including the petals of the Cymbopetalum penduliflorum tree, chile pepper, allspice, vanilla, and honey.\n\nThe Aztecs were unable to grow cocoa themselves, as their home in the Mexican highlands was unsuitable for it, so chocolate was a luxury imported into the empire.[13] Those who lived in areas ruled by the Aztecs were required to offer cocoa seeds in payment of the tax they deemed ""tribute"".[13] Cocoa beans were often used as currency.[15] For example, the Aztecs used a system in which one turkey cost 100 cocoa beans and one fresh avocado was worth three beans.[16]\n\nThe Maya and Aztecs associated cocoa with human sacrifice, and chocolate drinks specifically with sacrificial human blood. The Spanish royal chronicler Gonzalo Fern\xc3\xa1ndez de Oviedo y Vald\xc3\xa9s described a chocolate drink he had seen in Nicaragua in 1528, mixed with achiote: ""because those people are fond of drinking human blood, to make this beverage seem like blood, they add a little achiote, so that it then turns red. ... and part of that foam is left on the lips and around the mouth, and when it is red for having achiote, it seems a horrific thing, because it seems like blood itself.""\n\nEuropean adaptation\n\nThe morning chocolate by Chocolate soon became a fashionable drink of the European nobility after the discovery of the Americas.by Pietro Longhi ; Venice, 1775\xe2\x80\x931780\n\nUntil the 16th century, no European had ever heard of the popular drink from the Central American peoples.[13] Christopher Columbus and his son Ferdinand encountered the cocoa bean on Columbus\'s fourth mission to the Americas on 15 August 1502, when he and his crew seized a large native canoe that proved to contain cocoa beans among other goods for trade.[19] Spanish conquistador Hern\xc3\xa1n Cort\xc3\xa9s may have been the first European to encounter it, as the frothy drink was part of the after-dinner routine of Montezuma.[9][20] Jos\xc3\xa9 de Acosta, a Spanish Jesuit missionary who lived in Peru and then Mexico in the later 16th century, wrote of its growing influence on the Spaniards:\n\nAlthough bananas are more profitable, cocoa is more highly esteemed in Mexico. . . Cocoa is a smaller fruit than almonds and thicker, which toasted do not taste bad. It is so prized among the Indians and even among Spaniards. . . because since it is a dried fruit it can be stored for a long time without deterioration, and they brings ships loaded with them from the province of Guatemala. . . It also serves as currency, because with five cocoas you can buy one thing, with thirty another, and with a hundred something else, without there being contradiction; and they give these cocoas as alms to the poor who beg for them. The principal product of this cocoa is a concoction which they make that they call \xe2\x80\x9cchocolate,\xe2\x80\x9d which is a crazy thing treasured in that land, and those who are not accustomed are disgusted by it, because it has a foam on top and a bubbling like that of feces, which certainly takes a lot to put up with. Anyway, it is the prized beverage which the Indians offer to nobles who come to or pass through their lands; and the Spaniards, especially Spanish women born in those lands die for black chocolate. This aforementioned chocolate is said to the be made in various forms and temperaments, hot, cold, and lukewarm. They are wont to use spices and much chili; they also make it into a paste, and it is said that it is a medicine to treat coughs, the stomach, and colds. Whatever may be the case, in fact those who have not been reared on this opinion are not appetized by it.[21]\n\n""Trait\xc3\xa9s nouveaux & curieux du caf\xc3\xa9 du th\xc3\xa9 et du chocolate"", by Philippe Sylvestre Dufour, 1685 , by Philippe Sylvestre Dufour, 1685\n\nWhile Columbus had taken cocoa beans with him back to Spain,[19] chocolate made no impact until Spanish friars introduced it to the Spanish court.[13] After the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs, chocolate was imported to Europe. There, it quickly became a court favorite. It was still served as a beverage, but the Spanish added sugar, as well as honey (the original sweetener used by the Aztecs for chocolate), to counteract the natural bitterness.[22] Vanilla, another indigenous American introduction, was also a popular additive, with pepper and other spices sometimes used to give the illusion of a more potent vanilla flavor. Unfortunately, these spices tended to unsettle the European constitution; the Encyclop\xc3\xa9die states, ""The pleasant scent and sublime taste it imparts to chocolate have made it highly recommended; but a long experience having shown that it could potentially upset one\'s stomach"", which is why chocolate without vanilla was sometimes referred to as ""healthy chocolate"".[23] By 1602, chocolate had made its way from Spain to Austria.[24] By 1662, Pope Alexander VII had declared that religious fasts were not broken by consuming chocolate drinks. Within about a hundred years, chocolate established a foothold throughout Europe.[13]\n\nmoulinet or swizzle stick, London 1714\xe2\x80\x9315 ( Silver chocolate pot with hinged finial to insert aor swizzle stick, London 1714\xe2\x80\x9315 ( Victoria and Albert Museum\n\nThe new craze for chocolate brought with it a thriving slave market, as between the early 1600s and late 1800s, the laborious and slow processing of the cocoa bean was manual.[13] Cocoa plantations spread, as the English, Dutch, and French colonized and planted. With the depletion of Mesoamerican workers, largely to disease, cocoa production was often the work of poor wage laborers and African slaves. Wind-powered and horse-drawn mills were used to speed production, augmenting human labor. Heating the working areas of the table-mill, an innovation that emerged in France in 1732, also assisted in extraction.[25]\n\nNew processes that sped the production of chocolate emerged early in the Industrial Revolution. In 1815, Dutch chemist Coenraad van Houten introduced alkaline salts to chocolate, which reduced its bitterness.[13] A few years thereafter, in 1828, he created a press to remove about half the natural fat (cocoa butter or cocoa butter) from chocolate liquor, which made chocolate both cheaper to produce and more consistent in quality. This innovation introduced the modern era of chocolate.[19]\n\nKnown as ""Dutch cocoa"", this machine-pressed chocolate was instrumental in the transformation of chocolate to its solid form when, in 1847, English chocolatier Joseph Fry discovered a way to make chocolate moldable when he mixed the ingredients of cocoa powder and sugar with melted cocoa butter.[22] Subsequently, his chocolate factory, Fry\'s of Bristol, England, began mass-producing chocolate bars, Fry\'s Chocolate Cream, launched in 1866, and they became very popular.[26] Milk had sometimes been used as an addition to chocolate beverages since the mid-17th century, but in 1875 Swiss chocolatier Daniel Peter invented milk chocolate by mixing a powdered milk developed by Henri Nestl\xc3\xa9 with the liquor.[13][19] In 1879, the texture and taste of chocolate was further improved when Rudolphe Lindt invented the conching machine.[27]\n\nBesides Nestl\xc3\xa9, several notable chocolate companies had their start in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Rowntree\'s of York set up and began producing chocolate in 1862, after buying out the Tuke family business. Cadbury was manufacturing boxed chocolates in England by 1868.[13] Manufacturing their first Easter egg in 1875, Cadbury created the modern chocolate Easter egg after developing a pure cocoa butter that could easily be molded into smooth shapes.[28] In 1893, Milton S. Hershey purchased chocolate processing equipment at the World\'s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, and soon began the career of Hershey\'s chocolates with chocolate-coated caramels.\n\nIntroduction to the United States\n\nThe Baker Chocolate Company, which makes Baker\'s Chocolate, is the oldest producer of chocolate in the United States. In 1765 Dr. James Baker and John Hannon founded the company in Boston. Using cocoa beans from the West Indies, the pair built their chocolate business, which is still in operation.[29][30]\n\nWhite chocolate was first introduced to the U.S. in 1946 by Frederick E. Hebert of Hebert Candies in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, near Boston, after he had tasted ""white coat"" candies while traveling in Europe.[31][30]\n\nEtymology\n\nCocoa, pronounced by the Olmecs as kakawa,[1] dates to 1000 BC or earlier.[1] The word ""chocolate"" entered the English language from Spanish in about 1600.[32] The word entered Spanish from the word chocol\xc4\x81tl in Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs. The origin of the Nahuatl word is uncertain, as it does not appear in any early Nahuatl source, where the word for chocolate drink is cacahuatl, ""cocoa water"". It is possible that the Spaniards coined the word (perhaps in order to avoid caca, a vulgar Spanish word for ""faeces"") by combining the Yucatec Mayan word chocol, ""hot"", with the Nahuatl word atl, ""water"". A widely-cited proposal is that the derives from unattested xocolatl meaning ""bitter drink"" is unsupported; the change from x- to ch- is unexplained, as is the -l-. Another proposed etymology derives it from the word chicolatl, meaning ""beaten drink"", which may derive from the word for the frothing stick, chicoli.[34] Other scholars reject all these proposals, considering the origin of first element of the name to be unknown.[35] The term ""chocolatier"", for a chocolate confection maker, is attested from 1888.[36]\n\nTypes\n\nChocolate is commonly used as a coating for various fruits such as cherries and/or fillings, such as liqueurs\n\nSeveral types of chocolate can be distinguished. Pure, unsweetened chocolate, often called ""baking chocolate"", contains primarily cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions. Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, which combines chocolate with sugar.\n\nMilk\n\nMilk chocolate is sweet chocolate that also contains milk powder or condensed milk. In the UK and Ireland, milk chocolate must contain a minimum of 20% total dry cocoa solids; in the rest of the European Union, the minimum is 25%.[37]\n\nWhite\n\nWhite chocolate\n\nWhite chocolate, although similar in texture to that of milk and dark chocolate, does not contain any cocoa solids that impart a dark color. In 2002, the US Food and Drug Administration established a standard for white chocolate as the ""common or usual name of products made from cocoa fat (i.e., cocoa butter), milk solids, nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners, and other safe and suitable ingredients, but containing no nonfat cocoa solids"".[38]\n\nDark\n\nDark chocolate is produced by adding fat and sugar to the cocoa mixture. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration calls this ""sweet chocolate"", and requires a 15% concentration of chocolate liquor. European rules specify a minimum of 35% cocoa solids.[37] A higher amount of cocoa solids indicates more bitterness. Semisweet chocolate is dark chocolate with low sugar content. Bittersweet chocolate is chocolate liquor to which some sugar (typically a third), more cocoa butter and vanilla are added.[39] It has less sugar and more liquor than semisweet chocolate, but the two are interchangeable in baking. It is also known to last for two years if stored properly. As of 2017 , there is no high-quality evidence that dark chocolate affects blood pressure significantly or provides other health benefits.[40]\n\nUnsweetened\n\nUnsweetened chocolate is pure chocolate liquor, also known as bitter or baking chocolate. It is unadulterated chocolate: the pure, ground, roasted chocolate beans impart a strong, deep chocolate flavor. It is typically used in baking or other products to which sugar and other ingredients are added. Raw chocolate, often referred to as raw cocoa, is always dark and a minimum of 75% cocoa.\n\nUnsweetened ""Baking"" Chocolate\n\nPoorly tempered or untempered chocolate may have whitish spots on the dark chocolate part, called chocolate bloom; it is an indication that sugar or fat has separated due to poor storage. It is not toxic and can be safely consumed.[41]\n\nProduction\n\nChocolate is created from the cocoa bean. A cacao tree with fruit pods in various stages of ripening.\n\nRoughly two-thirds of the entire world\'s cocoa is produced in West Africa, with 43% sourced from C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire,[42] where, as of 2007 , child labor is a common practice to obtain the product.[43][44] According to the World Cocoa Foundation, in 2007 some 50 million people around the world depended on cocoa as a source of livelihood.[45] As of 2007 in the UK, most chocolatiers purchase their chocolate from them, to melt, mold and package to their own design.[46] According to the WCF\'s 2012 report, the Ivory Coast is the largest producer of cocoa in the world.[47] The two main jobs associated with creating chocolate candy are chocolate makers and chocolatiers. Chocolate makers use harvested cocoa beans and other ingredients to produce couverture chocolate (covering). Chocolatiers use the finished couverture to make chocolate candies (bars, truffles, etc.).[48]\n\nProduction costs can be decreased by reducing cocoa solids content or by substituting cocoa butter with another fat. Cocoa growers object to allowing the resulting food to be called ""chocolate"", due to the risk of lower demand for their crops.[45]\n\nGenome\n\nThe sequencing in 2010 of the genome of the cacao tree may allow yields to be improved.[49] Due to concerns about global warming effects on lowland climate in the narrow band of latitudes where cocoa is grown (20 degrees north and south of the equator), the commercial company Mars, Incorporated and the University of California, Berkeley are conducting genomic research in 2017\xe2\x80\x9318 to improve the survivability of cacao plants in hot climates.[50]\n\nCacao varieties\n\nChocolate is made from cocoa beans, the dried and fermented seeds of the cacao tree (Theobroma cacao), a small, 4\xe2\x80\x938 m tall (15\xe2\x80\x9326 ft tall) evergreen tree native to the deep tropical region of the Americas. Recent genetic studies suggest the most common genotype of the plant originated in the Amazon basin and was gradually transported by humans throughout South and Central America. Early forms of another genotype have also been found in what is now Venezuela. The scientific name, Theobroma, means ""food of the gods"".[51] The fruit, called a cocoa pod, is ovoid, 15\xe2\x80\x9330 cm (6\xe2\x80\x9312 in) long and 8\xe2\x80\x9310 cm (3\xe2\x80\x934 in) wide, ripening yellow to orange, and weighing about 500 g (1.1 lb) when ripe.\n\nCacao trees are small, understory trees that need rich, well-drained soils. They naturally grow within 20\xc2\xb0 of either side of the equator because they need about 2000 mm of rainfall a year, and temperatures in the range of 21 to 32 \xc2\xb0C (70 to 90 \xc2\xb0F). Cacao trees cannot tolerate a temperature lower than 15 \xc2\xb0C (59 \xc2\xb0F).[52]\n\nThe three main varieties of cocoa beans used in chocolate are criollo, forastero, and trinitario.\n\nCriollo\n\nRepresenting only 5% of all cocoa beans grown as of 2008 ,[53] criollo is the rarest and most expensive cocoa on the market, and is native to Central America, the Caribbean islands and the northern tier of South American states.[54] The genetic purity of cocoas sold today as criollo is disputed, as most populations have been exposed to the genetic influence of other varieties.\n\nCriollos are particularly difficult to grow, as they are vulnerable to a variety of environmental threats and produce low yields of cocoa per tree. The flavor of criollo is described as delicate yet complex, low in classic chocolate flavor, but rich in ""secondary"" notes of long duration.[55]\n\nForastero\n\nThe most commonly grown bean is forastero,[53] a large group of wild and cultivated cocoas, most likely native to the Amazon basin. The African cocoa crop is entirely made up of forastero. They are significantly hardier and of higher yield than criollo. The source of most chocolate marketed,[53] forastero cocoas are typically strong in classic ""chocolate"" flavor, but have a short duration and are unsupported by secondary flavors, producing ""quite bland"" chocolate.[53]\n\nTrinitario\n\nTrinitario is a natural hybrid of criollo and forastero. Trinitario originated in Trinidad after an introduction of forastero to the local criollo crop. Nearly all cocoa produced over the past five decades is of the forastero or lower-grade trinitario varieties.[56]\n\nProcessing\n\nCocoa pods are harvested by cutting them from the tree using a machete, or by knocking them off the tree using a stick. The beans with their surrounding pulp are removed from the pods and placed in piles or bins, allowing access to micro-organisms so fermentation of the pectin-containing material can begin. Yeasts produce ethanol, lactic acid bacteria produce lactic acid, and acetic acid bacteria produce acetic acid. The fermentation process, which takes up to seven days, also produces several flavor precursors, eventually resulting in the familiar chocolate taste.[57]\n\nIt is important to harvest the pods when they are fully ripe, because if the pod is unripe, the beans will have a low cocoa butter content, or sugars in the white pulp will be insufficient for fermentation, resulting in a weak flavor. After fermentation, the beans must be quickly dried to prevent mold growth. Climate and weather permitting, this is done by spreading the beans out in the sun from five to seven days.[58]\n\nThe dried beans are then transported to a chocolate manufacturing facility. The beans are cleaned (removing twigs, stones, and other debris), roasted, and graded. Next, the shell of each bean is removed to extract the nib. Finally, the nibs are ground and liquefied, resulting in pure chocolate in fluid form: chocolate liquor.[59] The liquor can be further processed into two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter.[60]\n\nBlending\n\nChocolate liquor is blended with the cocoa butter in varying quantities to make different types of chocolate or couverture. The basic blends of ingredients for the various types of chocolate (in order of highest quantity of cocoa liquor first), are:\n\nFountain chocolate is made with high levels of cocoa butter, allowing it to flow gently over a chocolate fountain to serve as dessert fondue\n\nDark chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa liquor, and (sometimes) vanilla\n\nMilk chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa liquor, milk or milk powder, and vanilla\n\nWhite chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, milk or milk powder, and vanilla\n\nUsually, an emulsifying agent, such as soy lecithin, is added, though a few manufacturers prefer to exclude this ingredient for purity reasons and to remain GMO-free, sometimes at the cost of a perfectly smooth texture. Some manufacturers are now using PGPR, an artificial emulsifier derived from castor oil that allows them to reduce the amount of cocoa butter while maintaining the same mouthfeel.\n\nThe texture is also heavily influenced by processing, specifically conching (see below). The more expensive chocolate tends to be processed longer and thus has a smoother texture and mouthfeel, regardless of whether emulsifying agents are added.\n\nDifferent manufacturers develop their own ""signature"" blends based on the above formulas, but varying proportions of the different constituents are used. The finest, plain dark chocolate couverture contains at least 70% cocoa (both solids and butter), whereas milk chocolate usually contains up to 50%. High-quality white chocolate couverture contains only about 35% cocoa butter.\n\nProducers of high-quality, small-batch chocolate argue that mass production produces bad-quality chocolate.[53] Some mass-produced chocolate contains much less cocoa (as low as 7% in many cases), and fats other than cocoa butter. Vegetable oils and artificial vanilla flavor are often used in cheaper chocolate to mask poorly fermented and/or roasted beans.[53]\n\nIn 2007, the Chocolate Manufacturers Association in the United States, whose members include Hershey, Nestl\xc3\xa9, and Archer Daniels Midland, lobbied the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to change the legal definition of chocolate to let them substitute partially hydrogenated vegetable oils for cocoa butter, in addition to using artificial sweeteners and milk substitutes.[61] Currently, the FDA does not allow a product to be referred to as ""chocolate"" if the product contains any of these ingredients.[62][63]\n\nIn the EU a product can be sold as chocolate if it contains up to 5% vegetable oil, and must be labeled as ""family milk chocolate"" rather than ""milk chocolate"" if it contains 20% milk.[64]\n\nAccording to Canadian Food and Drug Regulations,[65] a ""chocolate product"" is a food product that is sourced from at least one ""cocoa product"" and contains at least one of the following: ""chocolate, bittersweet chocolate, semi-sweet chocolate, dark chocolate, sweet chocolate, milk chocolate, or white chocolate"". A ""cocoa product"" is defined as a food product that is sourced from cocoa beans and contains ""cocoa nibs, cocoa liquor, cocoa mass, unsweetened chocolate, bitter chocolate, chocolate liquor, cocoa, low-fat cocoa, cocoa powder, or low-fat cocoa powder"".\n\nConching\n\nChocolate melanger mixing raw ingredients\n\nThe penultimate process is called conching. A conche is a container filled with metal beads, which act as grinders. The refined and blended chocolate mass is kept in a liquid state by frictional heat. Chocolate before conching has an uneven and gritty texture. The conching process produces cocoa and sugar particles smaller than the tongue can detect (typically around 20 \xce\xbcm) and reduces rough edges, hence the smooth feel in the mouth. The length of the conching process determines the final smoothness and quality of the chocolate. High-quality chocolate is conched for about 72 hours, and lesser grades about four to six hours. After the process is complete, the chocolate mass is stored in tanks heated to about 45 to 50 \xc2\xb0C (113 to 122 \xc2\xb0F) until final processing.[66]\n\nTempering\n\nVideo of cocoa beans being ground and mixed with other ingredients to make chocolate at a Mayordomo store in Oaxaca\n\nThe final process is called tempering. Uncontrolled crystallization of cocoa butter typically results in crystals of varying size, some or all large enough to be seen with the naked eye. This causes the surface of the chocolate to appear mottled and matte, and causes the chocolate to crumble rather than snap when broken.[67][68] The uniform sheen and crisp bite of properly processed chocolate are the results of consistently small cocoa butter crystals produced by the tempering process.\n\nThe fats in cocoa butter can crystallize in six different forms (polymorphous crystallization).[67][69] The primary purpose of tempering is to assure that only the best form is present. The six different crystal forms have different properties.\n\nCrystal Melting temp. Notes I 17 \xc2\xb0C (63 \xc2\xb0F) Soft, crumbly, melts too easily II 21 \xc2\xb0C (70 \xc2\xb0F) Soft, crumbly, melts too easily III 26 \xc2\xb0C (79 \xc2\xb0F) Firm, poor snap, melts too easily IV 28 \xc2\xb0C (82 \xc2\xb0F) Firm, good snap, melts too easily V 34 \xc2\xb0C (93 \xc2\xb0F) Glossy, firm, best snap, melts near body temperature (37 \xc2\xb0C) VI 36 \xc2\xb0C (97 \xc2\xb0F) Hard, takes weeks to form\n\nMolten chocolate and a piece of a chocolate bar\n\nAs a solid piece of chocolate, the cocoa butter fat particles are in a crystalline rigid structure that gives the chocolate its solid appearance. Once heated, the crystals of the polymorphic cocoa butter can break apart from the rigid structure and allow the chocolate to obtain a more fluid consistency as the temperature increases \xe2\x80\x93 the melting process. When the heat is removed, the cocoa butter crystals become rigid again and come closer together, allowing the chocolate to solidify.[70]\n\nThe temperature in which the crystals obtain enough energy to break apart from their rigid conformation would depend on the milk fat content in the chocolate and the shape of the fat molecules, as well as the form of the cocoa butterfat. Chocolate with a higher fat content will melt at a lower temperature.[71]\n\nMaking chocolate considered ""good"" is about forming as many type V crystals as possible. This provides the best appearance and texture and creates the most stable crystals, so the texture and appearance will not degrade over time. To accomplish this, the temperature is carefully manipulated during the crystallization.\n\npistoles and callets Chocolate cubes,and\n\nGenerally, the chocolate is first heated to 45 \xc2\xb0C (113 \xc2\xb0F) to melt all six forms of crystals.[67][69] Next, the chocolate is cooled to about 27 \xc2\xb0C (81 \xc2\xb0F), which will allow crystal types IV and V to form. At this temperature, the chocolate is agitated to create many small crystal ""seeds"" which will serve as nuclei to create small crystals in the chocolate. The chocolate is then heated to about 31 \xc2\xb0C (88 \xc2\xb0F) to eliminate any type IV crystals, leaving just type V. After this point, any excessive heating of the chocolate will destroy the temper and this process will have to be repeated. Other methods of chocolate tempering are used as well. The most common variant is introducing already tempered, solid ""seed"" chocolate. The temper of chocolate can be measured with a chocolate temper meter to ensure accuracy and consistency. A sample cup is filled with the chocolate and placed in the unit which then displays or prints the results.\n\nTwo classic ways of manually tempering chocolate are:\n\nWorking the molten chocolate on a heat-absorbing surface, such as a stone slab, until thickening indicates the presence of sufficient crystal ""seeds""; the chocolate is then gently warmed to working temperature.\n\nStirring solid chocolate into molten chocolate to ""inoculate"" the liquid chocolate with crystals (this method uses the already formed crystals of the solid chocolate to ""seed"" the molten chocolate).\n\nChocolate tempering machines (or temperers) with computer controls can be used for producing consistently tempered chocolate. In particular, continuous tempering machines are used in large volume applications. Various methods and apparatuses for continuous flow tempering have been described by Aasted, Sollich and Buhler, three manufacturers of commercial chocolate equipment, with a focus now on energy efficiency. In general, molten chocolate coming in at 40\xe2\x80\x9350 \xc2\xb0C is cooled in heat exchangers to crystallization temperates of about 26\xe2\x80\x9330 \xc2\xb0C, passed through a tempering column consisting of spinning plates to induce shear, then warmed slightly to re-melt undesirable crystal formations.[72][73]\n\nShaping\n\nChocolate is molded in different shapes for different uses:[74]\n\nChocolate bars (tablets) are rectangular blocks of chocolate meant to be broken down to cubes (or other predefined shapes), which can then be used for consumption, cooking and baking. The term is also used for combination bars, which are a type of candy bars\n\nChocolate chips are small pieces of chocolate, usually drop-like, which are meant for decoration and baking\n\nPistoles , callets and f\xc3\xa8ves are small, coin-like or bean-like pieces of chocolate meant for baking and patisserie applications (also see Pistole (coin) and F\xc3\xa8ve (trinket))\n\n, and are small, coin-like or bean-like pieces of chocolate meant for baking and patisserie applications (also see Pistole (coin) and F\xc3\xa8ve (trinket)) Chocolate blocks are large, cuboid chunks of chocolate meant for professional use and further processing\n\nOther, more specialized shapes for chocolate include sticks, curls and hollow semi-spheres\n\nStorage\n\nChocolate is very sensitive to temperature and humidity. Ideal storage temperatures are between 15 and 17 \xc2\xb0C (59 and 63 \xc2\xb0F), with a relative humidity of less than 50%. If refrigerated or frozen without containment, chocolate can absorb enough moisture to cause a whitish discoloration, the result of fat or sugar crystals rising to the surface. Various types of ""blooming"" effects can occur if chocolate is stored or served improperly.[75]\n\nChocolate bloom is caused by storage temperature fluctuating or exceeding 24 \xc2\xb0C (75 \xc2\xb0F), while sugar bloom is caused by temperature below 15 \xc2\xb0C (59 \xc2\xb0F) or excess humidity. To distinguish between different types of bloom, one can rub the surface of the chocolate lightly, and if the bloom disappears, it is fat bloom. Moving chocolate between temperature extremes, can result in an oily texture. Although visually unappealing, chocolate suffering from bloom is safe for consumption and taste unaffected.[76][77][78] Bloom can be reversed by retempering the chocolate or using it for any use that requires melting the chocolate.[79]\n\nChocolate is generally stored away from other foods, as it can absorb different aromas. Ideally, chocolates are packed or wrapped, and placed in proper storage with the correct humidity and temperature. Additionally, chocolate is frequently stored in a dark place or protected from light by wrapping paper. The glossy shine, snap, aroma, texture, and taste of the chocolate can show the quality and if it was stored well.[80]\n\nComposition\n\nNutrition\n\nA 100-gram serving of milk chocolate supplies 540 calories. It is 59% carbohydrates (52% as sugar and 3% as dietary fiber), 30% fat and 8% protein (table). Approximately 65% of the fat in milk chocolate is saturated, mainly palmitic acid and stearic acid, while the predominant unsaturated fat is oleic acid (table).\n\n100-grams of milk chocolate is an excellent source (over 19% of the Daily Value, DV) of riboflavin, vitamin B12 and the dietary minerals, manganese, phosphorus and zinc. Chocolate is a good source (10\xe2\x80\x9319% DV) of calcium, magnesium and iron.\n\nEffects on health\n\nChocolate may be a factor for heartburn in some people because one of its constituents, theobromine, may affect the esophageal sphincter muscle in a way that permits stomach acids to enter the esophagus.[81] Theobromine poisoning is an overdosage reaction to the bitter alkaloid, which happens more frequently in domestic animals than humans. However, daily intake of 50\xe2\x80\x93100 g cocoa (0.8\xe2\x80\x931.5 g theobromine) by humans has been associated with sweating, trembling and severe headache.[82] Chocolate contains alkaloids such as theobromine and phenethylamine, which have physiological effects in humans, but the presence of theobromine renders it toxic to some animals, including dogs and cats.[83]\n\nAccording to a 2005 study, the average lead concentration of cocoa beans is \xe2\x89\xa4 0.5 ng/g, which is one of the lowest reported values for a natural food.[84] However, during cultivation and production, chocolate may absorb lead from the environment (such as in atmospheric emissions of leaded gasoline, which is still being used in Nigeria).[84] Reports from 2014 indicate that ""chocolate might be a significant source"" of lead ingestion for children if consumption is high (with dark chocolate containing higher amounts),[85][86] and ""one 10 g cube of dark chocolate may contain as much as 20% of the daily lead oral limit.""[85]\n\nChocolate and cocoa contain moderate to high amounts of oxalate,[87][88] which may increase the risk of kidney stones.[89]\n\nA few studies have documented allergic reactions from chocolate in children.[81] Other research has shown that dark chocolate can aggravate acne in men who are prone to it.[90] Research has also shown that consuming dark chocolate does not substantially affect blood pressure.[40] Chocolate and cocoa are under preliminary research to determine if consumption affects the risk of certain cardiovascular diseases[91] or cognitive abilities.[92]\n\nOne tablespoonful (5 grams) of dry unsweetened cocoa powder has 12.1 mg of caffeine[93] and a 25-g single serving of dark chocolate has 22.4 mg of caffeine.[94] Although a single 7 oz. serving of coffee may contain 80\xe2\x80\x93175 mg,[95] studies have shown psychoactive effects in caffeine doses as low as 9 mg,[96] and a dose as low as 12.5 mg was shown to have effects on cognitive performance.[97]\n\nExcessive consumption of large quantities of any energy-rich food, such as chocolate, without a corresponding increase in activity to expend the associated calories, can cause weight gain and possibly lead to obesity.[81] Raw chocolate is high in cocoa butter, a fat which is removed during chocolate refining and then added back in varying proportions during the manufacturing process. Manufacturers may add other fats, sugars, and milk, all of which increase the caloric content of chocolate.[81]\n\nPhytochemicals\n\nIn comparison to most foods, cocoa contains more phenolic antioxidants.[98] Cocoa solids are a source of flavonoids[99] and alkaloids, such as theobromine, phenethylamine, and caffeine.[100]\n\nLabeling\n\nSome manufacturers provide the percentage of chocolate in a finished chocolate confection as a label quoting percentage of ""cocoa"" or ""cacao"". This refers to the combined percentage of both cocoa solids and cocoa butter in the bar, not just the percentage of cocoa solids.[101] The Belgian AMBAO certification mark indicates that no non-cocoa vegetable fats have been used in making the chocolate.[102][103] A long-standing dispute between Britain on the one hand and Belgium and France over British use of vegetable fats in chocolate ended in 2000 with the adoption of new standards which permitted the use of up to five percent vegetable fats in clearly labelled products.[104] This British style of chocolate has sometimes been pejoratively referred to as ""vegelate"".[104]\n\nChocolates that are organic[105] or fair trade certified[106] carry labels accordingly.\n\nIn the United States, some large chocolate manufacturers lobbied the federal government to permit confections containing cheaper hydrogenated vegetable oil in place of cocoa butter to be sold as ""chocolate"". In June 2007, in response to consumer concern about the proposal, the FDA reiterated ""Cacao fat, as one of the signature characteristics of the product, will remain a principal component of standardized chocolate.""[107]\n\nIndustry\n\nChocolate, prevalent throughout the world, is a steadily growing, US$50 billion-a-year worldwide business.[108] Europe accounts for 45% of the world\'s chocolate revenue,[109] and the US spent $20 billion in 2013.[110] Big Chocolate is the grouping of major international chocolate companies in Europe and the U.S. U.S. companies Mars and Hershey\'s alone generated $13 billion a year in chocolate sales and account for two-thirds of U.S. production in 2004.[111] Despite the expanding reach of the chocolate industry internationally, cocoa farmers and labourers in the Ivory Coast are unaware of the uses of the beans; the high cost of chocolate products in the Ivory Coast make it inaccessible to the majority of the population, who do not know what it tastes like.[112]\n\nManufacturers\n\nChocolate with various fillings\n\nChocolate manufacturers produce a range of products from chocolate bars to fudge. Large manufacturers of chocolate products include Cadbury (the world\'s largest confectionery manufacturer), Ferrero, Guylian, The Hershey Company, Lindt & Spr\xc3\xbcngli, Mars, Incorporated, Milka, Neuhaus and Suchard.\n\nGuylian is best known for its chocolate sea shells; Cadbury for its Dairy Milk and Creme Egg. The Hershey Company, the largest chocolate manufacturer in North America, produces the Hershey Bar and Hershey\'s Kisses.[113] Mars Incorporated, a large privately owned U.S. corporation, produces Mars Bar, Milky Way, M&M\'s, Twix, and Snickers. Lindt is known for its truffle balls and gold foil-wrapped Easter bunnies.\n\nFood conglomerates Nestl\xc3\xa9 SA and Kraft Foods both have chocolate brands. Nestl\xc3\xa9 acquired Rowntree\'s in 1988 and now markets chocolates under their brand, including Smarties (a chocolate candy) and Kit Kat (a chocolate bar); Kraft Foods through its 1990 acquisition of Jacobs Suchard, now owns Milka and Suchard. In February 2010, Kraft also acquired British-based Cadbury;[114] Fry\'s, Trebor Basset and the fair trade brand Green & Black\'s also belongs to the group.\n\nChild labor in cocoa harvesting\n\nThe widespread use of children in cocoa production is controversial, not only for the concerns about child labor and exploitation, but also because up to 12,000 of the 200,000 children working in C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire, the world\'s biggest producer of cocoa,[115] may be victims of trafficking or slavery.[116] Most attention on this subject has focused on West Africa, which collectively supplies 69 percent of the world\'s cocoa, and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire in particular, which supplies 35 percent of the world\'s cocoa. Thirty percent of children under age 15 in sub-Saharan Africa are child laborers, mostly in agricultural activities including cocoa farming.[118] Major chocolate producers, such as Nestl\xc3\xa9, buy cocoa at commodities exchanges where Ivorian cocoa is mixed with other cocoa.[119]\n\nIn 2009, Salvation Army International Development (SAID) UK stated that 12,000 children have been trafficked on cocoa farms in the Ivory Coast of Africa, where half of the world\'s chocolate is made.[120] SAID UK states that it is these child slaves who are likely to be working in ""harsh and abusive""[121] conditions for the production of chocolate,[120] and an increasing number of health-food[122] and anti-slavery[123] organisations are highlighting and campaigning against the use of trafficking in the chocolate industry.\n\nAs of 2017, approximately 2.1 million children in Ghana and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire were involved in farming cocoa, carrying heavy loads, clearing forests, and being exposed to pesticides.[5] According to Sona Ebai, the former secretary-general of the Alliance of Cocoa Producing Countries: ""I think child labor cannot be just the responsibility of industry to solve. I think it\'s the proverbial all-hands-on-deck: government, civil society, the private sector. And there, you need leadership.""[116] Reported in 2018, a 3-year pilot program \xe2\x80\x93 conducted by Nestl\xc3\xa9 with 26,000 farmers mostly located in C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire \xe2\x80\x93 observed a 51% decrease in the number of children doing hazardous jobs in cocoa farming.[4] The US Department of Labor formed the Child Labor Cocoa Coordinating Group as a public-private partnership with the governments of Ghana and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire to address child labor practices in the cocoa industry.[124] The International Cocoa Initiative involving major cocoa manufacturers established the Child Labor Monitoring and Remediation System intended to monitor thousands of farms in Ghana and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire for child labor conditions,[4][5] but the program reached less than 20% of the child laborers.[125] Despite these efforts, goals to reduce child labor in West Africa by 70% before 2020 are frustrated by persistent poverty, absence of schools, expansion of cocoa farmland, and increased demand for cocoa.[4][126]\n\nIn April 2018, the Cocoa Barometer report stated: ""Not a single company or government is anywhere near reaching the sector-wide objective of the elimination of child labor, and not even near their commitments of a 70% reduction of child labor by 2020"".[126]\n\nFair trade\n\nIn the 2000s, some chocolate producers began to engage in fair trade initiatives, to address concerns about the marginalization of cocoa laborers in developing countries. Traditionally, Africa and other developing countries received low prices for their exported commodities such as cocoa, which caused poverty to abound. Fairtrade seeks to establish a system of direct trade from developing countries to counteract this unfair system.[127] One solution for fair labor practices is for farmers to become part of an Agricultural cooperative. Cooperatives pay farmers a fair price for their cocoa so farmers have enough money for food, clothes, and school fees.[128] One of the main tenets of fair trade is that farmers receive a fair price, but this does not mean that the larger amount of money paid for fair trade cocoa goes directly to the farmers. The effectiveness of fair trade has been questioned. In a 2014 article, The Economist stated that workers on fair trade farms have a lower standard of living than on similar farms outside the fair trade system.[129]\n\nUsage and consumption\n\ns\'more topped with melted chocolate from a chocolate bar\n\nChocolate cake with chocolate frosting\n\nBars\n\nChocolate is sold in chocolate bars, which come in dark chocolate, milk chocolate and white chocolate varieties. Some bars that are mostly chocolate have other ingredients blended into the chocolate, such as nuts, raisins, or crisped rice. Chocolate is used as an ingredient in a huge variety of bars, which typically contain various confectionary ingredients (e.g., nougat, wafers, caramel, nuts, etc.) which are coated in chocolate.\n\nCoating and filling\n\nChocolate is used as a flavouring product in many desserts, such as chocolate cakes, chocolate brownies, chocolate mousse and chocolate chip cookies. Numerous types of candy and snacks contain chocolate, either as a filling (e.g., M&M\'s) or as a coating (e.g., chocolate-coated raisins or chocolate-coated peanuts).\n\nBeverages\n\nSome non-alcoholic beverages contain chocolate, such as chocolate milk, hot chocolate, chocolate milkshakes and tejate. Some alcoholic liqueurs are flavoured with chocolate, such as chocolate liqueur and creme de cacao. Chocolate is a popular flavour of ice cream and pudding, and chocolate sauce is a commonly added as a topping on ice cream sundaes. The caff\xc3\xa8 mocha is an espresso beverage containing chocolate.\n\nSee also\n\nReferences'";"Other";"401.txt-Other"

Its earliest use dates back to the Olmec civilization in Mesoamerica.\n\nThe next time you eat a piece of chocolate, you may not have to feel so guilty about it. Despite its bad reputation for causing weight gain, a number of health benefits may be associated with this delicious treat.\n\nShare on Pinterest Recent research suggests that chocolate may have some health benefits.\n\nChocolate receives a lot of bad press because of its high fat and sugar content. Its consumption has been associated with acne, obesity, high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, and diabetes.\n\nHowever, according to a review of chocolate\xe2\x80\x99s health effects published in the Netherlands Journal of Medicine, it\xe2\x80\x99s not all bad news.\n\nThe authors point to the discovery that cocoa, the key ingredient in chocolate, contains biologically active phenolic compounds.\n\nThis has changed people\xe2\x80\x99s views on chocolate, and it has stimulated research into how it might impact aging, and conditions such as oxidative stress, blood pressure regulation, and atherosclerosis.\n\nChocolate\xe2\x80\x99s antioxidant potential may have a range of health benefits. The higher the cocoa content, as in dark chocolate, the more benefits there are. Dark chocolate may also contain less fat and sugar, but it is important to check the label.\n\nEating chocolate may have the following benefits:\n\nlowering cholesterol levels\n\npreventing cognitive decline\n\nreducing the risk of cardiovascular problems\n\nIt is important to note that the possible health benefits mentioned below came from single studies. More research is needed to confirm that eating chocolate can really improve people\xe2\x80\x99s health.\n\nIn addition, chocolate bars do not contain only cocoa. The benefits and risks of any other ingredients, such as sugar and fat, need to be considered.\n\n1) Cholesterol\n\nOne study, published in The Journal of Nutrition, suggests that chocolate consumption might help reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, also known as \xe2\x80\x9cbad cholesterol.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe researchers set out to investigate whether chocolate bars containing plant sterols (PS) and cocoa flavanols (CF) have any effect on cholesterol levels.\n\nThe authors concluded: \xe2\x80\x9cRegular consumption of chocolate bars containing PS and CF, as part of a low-fat diet, may support cardiovascular health by lowering cholesterol and improving blood pressure.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n2) Cognitive function\n\nScientists at Harvard Medical School have suggested that drinking two cups of hot chocolate a day could help keep the brain healthy and reduce memory decline in older people.\n\nThe researchers found that hot chocolate helped improve blood flow to parts of the brain where it was needed.\n\nLead author, Farzaneh A. Sorond, said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs different areas of the brain need more energy to complete their tasks, they also need greater blood flow. This relationship, called neurovascular coupling, may play an important role in diseases such as Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nResults of a lab experiment, published in 2014, indicated that a cocoa extract, called lavado, might reduce or prevent damage to nerve pathways found in patients with Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s disease. This extract could help slow symptoms such as cognitive decline.\n\nAnother study, published in 2016 in the journal Appetite, suggests eating chocolate at least once weekly could improve cognitive function.\n\n3) Heart disease\n\nResearch published in The BMJ, suggests that consuming chocolate could help lower the risk of developing heart disease by one-third .\n\nBased on their observations, the authors concluded that higher levels of chocolate consumption could be linked to a lower risk of cardiometabolic disorders.\n\nThey call for further experimental studies to confirm whether consuming chocolate is beneficial.\n\n4) Stroke\n\nCanadian scientists, in a study involving 44,489 individuals, found that people who ate one serving of chocolate were 22 percent less likely to experience a stroke than those who did not. Also, those who had about two ounces of chocolate a week were 46 percent less likely to die from a stroke.\n\nA further study, published in the journal Heart in 2015, tracked the impact of diet on the long-term health of 25,000 men and women.\n\nThe findings suggested that eating up to 100 grams (g) of chocolate each day may be linked to a lower risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\n5) Fetal growth and development\n\nEating 30 g (about one ounce) of chocolate every day during pregnancy might benefit fetal growth and development, according to a study presented at the 2016 Pregnancy Meeting of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine in Atlanta, GA.\n\n6) Athletic performance\n\nShare on Pinterest Chocolate may help athletes cover more distance while using less oxygen.\n\nFindings published in The Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition suggest that a little dark chocolate might boost oxygen availability during fitness training.\n\nResearchers who studied cyclists doing time trials in the United Kingdom found that \xe2\x80\x9cAfter eating dark chocolate, the riders used less oxygen when cycling at a moderate pace and also covered more distance in a two-minute flat-out time trial.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe scientists believe that the success of dark chocolate in this case is that it contains flavonols known as epicatechins, which enhance the release of nitric oxide in the body.

"404.txt";"b'Chocolate is the most popular sweet treat in the world. People around the world (but mostly in Europe and the United States) consume more than 3 million tons of cocoa beans a year, according to the World Cocoa Foundation. And, not only does eating chocolate make you feel good, it may also be good for your heart and your brain.\n\nWhat is chocolate?\n\nChocolate is prepared from the fruit of the Theobroma cacao, a tropical tree whose name means ""food of the gods"" in Greek, according to ""Chocolate: Food of the Gods,"" an online exhibit by the Cornell University Library.\n\nTheobroma cacao trees are native to the Amazon and Orinoco river basins in South America. The trees are widely distributed from southeastern Mexico to the Amazon River. They thrive in hot, humid areas within about 20 degrees of the equator, according to Cornell. As the popularity of chocolate spread, growers established plantations in other regions, such as West Africa and South and Southeast Asia. Today, Ghana, C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire, Nigeria, Indonesia and Brazil account for 79 percent of the world\'s cacao production.\n\nCacao trees bear fruit that are about the same size and shape of a papaya, according to Patric Chocolate. These bumpy, lumpy berries, or pods, are full of up to 50 sour seeds, or beans, covered in white pulp.\n\nCacao seeds are harvested by hand because machines could injure the trees, according to Cornell. Workers remove the pods, which are orange when they are ripe, and open them with a machete. The seeds are placed in large fermentation trays that are stacked and covered in banana leaves, where they are left for two to seven days. Fermentation produces the chocolate flavor and aroma. It also destroys the seed\'s embryo, preventing unwanted germination, and causes the white pulp to fall away from the seeds.\n\nAfter fermenting, the beans dry out on sunny platforms. Workers turn them several times a day for three to five days to complete drying. The beans can dry faster in rotary driers but sun-dried beans taste the best, according to Cornell.\n\nNext, the beans are taken to the chocolate factory, where they are cleaned and debris is removed. The beans are roasted in large, rotating ovens. The roasting draws out flavor and removes the beans from their hulls. Roasted beans go into a winnowing machine, which cracks the beans and removes hulls. The remaining part of the bean is called the nib. Nibs become chocolate.\n\nThe nibs are ground down under a series of rollers. This process results in a thick paste called chocolate liquor. Chocolate liquor does not contain alcohol (however, chocolate liqueur does). It is the main source of unsweetened baking chocolate, according to Pam Williams, co-founder and past president of the Fine Chocolate Industry Association (FCIA) and founder and lead instructor of Ecole Cocolat Professional School of Chocolate Arts.\n\nAt this stage, the type of chocolate being produced is determined. According to the FCIA, ingredients separate fine chocolate from that of average quality. ""Fine chocolate,"" as designated by the FCIA, contains only cacao liquor, cacao butter (optional), sugar, lecithin, vanilla (optional) and possibly milk fats and solids. Additional flavors or ingredients like nuts can be added later.\n\n(Image credit: Dreamstime)\n\nTypes of chocolate\n\nFine chocolate falls into three categories: dark chocolate, milk chocolate and white chocolate, Williams said.\n\nDark chocolate has chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, lecithin, sugar and vanilla.\n\nMilk chocolate has all of the above plus milk fats and milk solids.\n\nWhite chocolate contains everything milk chocolate does except chocolate liquor.\n\nChocolatiers debate whether white chocolate is really chocolate. Until 2002, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration considered it a confectionary rather than chocolate because it does not contain chocolate liquor. The Hershey Food Corp. and the Chocolate Manufacturers Association petitioned the FDA, which added a standard of identity for white chocolate. Because the FDA refers to it as white chocolate, rather than confectionary, some experts, like Williams, accept white chocolate as chocolate.\n\nWithin the three categories, the FDA also acknowledges several grades, Williams said. They include unsweetened or brute, which can be up to 99 percent chocolate liquor; bittersweet; semisweet; and dark milk chocolate. The type of chocolate depends on what ingredients are present and the percentage of cocoa, in addition to where the beans are from and the way they are prepared.\n\nHealth benefits of chocolate\n\nGood heart food\n\nSeveral recent studies have examined the role that chocolate may have on heart health. Cacao beans are full of phytonutrients, which act as antioxidants and provide additional benefits. Furthermore, cacao beans are rich sources of iron, copper, magnesium, zinc and phosphorus, according to the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Dark chocolate contains two to three times more beneficial flavanols than milk chocolate because milk chocolate\'s cacao concentration is diluted with milk and possibly more sugar.\n\nWhile most studies have found some correlation between chocolate consumption and reduced risk of heart problems, the amount and type of chocolate needed requires further study. A 2017 meta-analysis of the effects of chocolate on coronary heart disease, stroke and diabetes published in the journal Nutrients concluded that the most benefit was associated with moderate chocolate intake. The authors found little benefit in heart disease or stroke reduction among people who consumed chocolate more than three times a week. Protective effects against diabetes emerged at two servings a week, but that benefit disappeared if people had more than six servings a week.\n\nOn the other hand, the findings of a large-scale study of more than 150,000 primarily male U.S. veterans who did not have coronary artery disease at the beginning of the study, suggest that eating an ounce of chocolate at least five times a week may help prevent the risk of coronary artery disease-related events like heart attack and heart failure.\n\nChocolate may also help prevent the development of atrial fibrillation, a type of irregular heartbeat that increases the risk of heart failure, stroke and more. A study, published in the journal Heart in 2017, found that adults who ate chocolate at least once a month had 10 to 20 percent lower rates of developing atrial fibrillation than those who never or rarely ate chocolate.\n\nGood brain food\n\nChocolate may be good for the brain. Some studies have focused on chocolate\'s ability to improve cognitive function. A study published in the Journal of Alzheimer\'s Disease in 2016 found that chocolate consumption might lower the risk of cognitive decline in older people. The study looked at nearly 400 Portuguese citizens over age 65 and saw that those who ate a moderate amount of chocolate \xe2\x80\x94 on average, one chocolate snack a week; the study did not differentiate between milk and dark chocolate \xe2\x80\x94 decreased their risk of cognitive decline by 40 percent over two years. Those who ate more chocolate, or those who had more caffeine, saw fewer cognitive benefits.\n\nGood mood food\n\nChocolate is often associated with positive effects on mood, but the reasons why it makes some people feel good are debatable. Chocolate contains substances that stimulate the brain in the same way cannabis does, such as anandamines, and substances that have similar effects as amphetamine, such as tyramine and phenylethylamine, according to the Dartmouth Undergraduate Journal of Science. However, these substances are in very low concentrations \xe2\x80\x94 too low to induce an antidepressant effect.\n\nChocolate may interact with neurotransmitter systems that contribute to appetite, reward and mood regulation, such as dopamine, serotonin and endorphins, according to the 2013 article in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology. However, the authors noted, the effects may have more to do with chocolate\'s taste and smell than its chemical effects.\n\nA 2010 study published in Archives of Internal Medicine found a link between depression and chocolate consumption. The results showed that people who scored high on a screening test for depression consumed more chocolate than those who weren\'t considered depressed. However, the study pointed out that there is only a link, and cannot explain why. Since the participants were not followed over time, the researchers don\'t know whether eating chocolate ameliorates or amplifies a sad mood. The possibilities are many \xe2\x80\x94 from using chocolate as a sort of natural Prozac to the idea that chocolate might have some role in driving depression.\n\nHealth risks of eating chocolate\n\nLike many foods, chocolate is healthiest when eaten in moderation. The sugars and fats that are added to chocolate make it high in calories, which may lead to weight gain. Furthermore, many of the protective effects that chocolate may offer might be mitigated by overconsumption.\n\nHistory of chocolate\n\nScientists debate how long humans have been using and consuming cacao beans. Chocolate\'s history goes back at least 2,000 years, while historians Sophie and Michael Coe, authors of ""The True History of Chocolate"" (Thames and Hudson, 2013), suggest that it might go back four millennia. The word chocolate can be traced back to the Aztec word ""xocoatl,"" the name for a bitter drink made from cacao beans. This was the way chocolate was consumed until the Spanish conquistadors came to Central America.\n\nIn several pre-Columbian Latin American societies, cacao beans were used as currency, according to Smithsonian magazine. Mayans and Aztecs believed the beans had mystical properties and used them during important rituals. When the Spanish arrived, sweetened chocolate came into existence. Legend has it that the Aztec king Montezuma gave conquistador Hern\xc3\xa1n Cort\xc3\xa9s a bitter chocolate drink, which he said was disgusting. But Cort\xc3\xa9s\' men added cane sugar and honey to it and took it back to Spain, where it quickly became popular.\n\nChocolate was a fashionable drink for rich Europeans throughout the 18th century. The Industrial Revolution allowed chocolate to be mass-produced and brought the treat to the masses. The popularity led to the development of cacao tree plantations.\n\nEnslaved people farmed most of the plantations. Initially, Spanish colonizers forced Mesoamericans to farm the cacao plantations, according to ""The Biography of Chocolate"" (Crabtree Publishing Co., 2005), by Adrianna Morganelli. When the indigenous peoples began to die in large numbers from diseases brought by Europeans, enslaved Africans were brought over to make up the labor shortage. In addition to sugarcane, indigo and other crops, enslaved Africans planted, maintained and harvested cacao trees throughout the Caribbean, Central and South America to feed the new European taste for chocolate.\n\nIn 1815, Dutch physicist Coenraad Van Houten experimented with removing varied amounts of the cocoa butter from chocolate liquor, according to Cornell University. This led to the creation of cocoa powder and soon solid chocolate.\n\nIn 1847, a Bristol, England, chocolate company, Fry\'s, created the first mass-produced chocolate bar when Joseph Fry added additional cocoa butter to Van Houten\'s chocolate, which turned it into a moldable paste, according to Bristol Museums. Milk chocolate was invented soon after with the help of Henri Nestl\xc3\xa9, who went on to found the major food company that bears his name. Major European chocolate brands Lindt and Cadbury also got their start in the 1800s; Rodolphe Lindt invented the conching machine, which gives chocolate a velvety texture.\n\nMass chocolate consumption hit the United States in the late 1800s when Milton S. Hershey began selling chocolate-coated caramels. He then developed his own formula for milk chocolate, purchased chocolate factory equipment and introduced mass-produced chocolate bars and other shapes, like Hershey\'s Kisses, in 1900.\n\nIn 1923, the Mars Co. developed the Milky Way bar by putting nougat inside a chocolate bar. That same year, former Hershey employee H.B. Reese introduced Reese\'s Peanut Butter Cups, which later became part of the Hershey brand.\n\nAs the years progressed, chocolate concoctions from both small and large producers became increasingly innovative. In September 2017, Swiss chocolate company Barry Callebaut introduced ruby chocolate. Ruby chocolate comes from isolating specific compounds in cocoa beans, according to Confectionary News. That, along with a modified processing technique, results in a rosy pink chocolate that has a sweet but sour berry taste and no traditional chocolate flavor, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. Other colored chocolates are made from dyed white chocolate.\n\nThreats to chocolate\n\nChocolate production is threatened by climate change. According to a 2016 report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the primary cacao-producing countries of C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire, Ghana, and Indonesia will experience a 2.1 degree Celsius (3.7 degrees Fahrenheit) increase in temperature by 2050. Rainfall will not rise along with the temperature, causing lowered humidity levels. As a result, viable land for cacao production will significantly shrink. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\'s Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability report, 89.5 percent of the 294 chocolate-producing locations studied would become less suitable by 2050.\n\nFarmers and scientists are working to develop strategies to maintain chocolate production. Some farmers are planting taller trees next to cacao trees to increase shade and decrease moisture loss, according to the NOAA. Cacao plantations may also move to higher elevations with cooler temperatures and greater rainfall.\n\nGenetic scientists are taking a different approach. A January 2018 press release from the Innovative Genomics Institute announced a project to develop disease-resistant cacao. Condensing cacao plantations because of climate change could increase the spread of disease. The project will use CRISPR DNA-editing technology to make a heartier cacao seed.\n\nEthics of chocolate production\n\nAccording to Slave Free Chocolate, 2.3 million children work in chocolate production in Ghana and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire, where they are vulnerable to trafficking, slavery and other violent labor practices. The International Labor Rights Forum reports that these children are often exposed to chemicals, work long hours and are denied education. According to Epicure and Culture, many children are sold into slavery and never see their families again. Others are kidnapped.\n\nThough the Harkin-Engel Protocol of 2001 was designed to stop child labor in the chocolate industry, according to the CNN Freedom Project, little has changed. The deadlines for action have been repeatedly pushed back.\n\nConsumers who want ethical chocolate should look for certifications designating Fair Trade, Rain Forest Alliance, UTZ, and Fair for Life, according to Slave Free Chocolate\xe2\x80\x99s guide to chocolate companies.\n\nChocolate production can also harm the environment. Farmers often clear forests to make room for cacao plantations. According to the World Wildlife Fund, about 70 percent of C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire\'s illegal deforestation is related to cacao farming. One danger of deforestation is soil erosion, which can make land less fertile for cacao plants, creating a vicious cycle, according to Confectionary News.\n\nAdditional resources'";"Other";"404.txt-Other"
"408.txt";"b'The history of chocolate can be traced back more than 3,000 years to the Maya, Toltec, and Aztec people who prepared a beverage from the fruit of the cocoa bean. The Maya considered chocolate to be the food of the gods, held the cacao tree to be sacred, and buried dignitaries with bowls of chocolate.\n\nFull Article\n\nchocolate , food product made from cocoa beans , consumed as candy and used to make beverages and to flavour or coat various confections and bakery products. Rich in carbohydrates , it is an excellent source of quick energy, and it also contains minute amounts of the stimulating alkaloids theobromine and caffeine .\n\nHistory of chocolate\n\nThe cacao tree was cultivated more than 3,000 years ago by the Maya, Toltec, and Aztec peoples, who prepared a beverage from its fruit, the cocoa bean (sometimes using it as a ceremonial drink) and also used the bean as a currency. The Maya considered chocolate to be the food of the gods, held the cacao tree to be sacred, and even buried dignitaries with bowls of the substance (along with other items deemed useful in the afterlife). In fact, the identification of the (Olmec-originated) word ka-ka-w (\xe2\x80\x9ccacao\xe2\x80\x9d) inscribed on those containers was key to deciphering the Maya\xe2\x80\x99s phonetic manner of writing.\n\nSpain was the earliest European country to incorporate chocolate into its cuisine, but exactly how that happened is vague. It is known that Christopher Columbus took cocoa beans to Spain after his fourth voyage in 1502, though little was made of it at that time. It has been commonly thought (though there appears to be no evidence) that in 1519 Montezuma II, the Aztec ruler of Mexico, served a bitter cocoa-bean drink to the Spanish conquistador Hern\xc3\xa1n Cort\xc3\xa9s, who subsequently introduced the drink to Spain. A strong possibility is that chocolate first arrived in Spain in 1544 with representatives of the Kekch\xc3\xad Mayan people of Guatemala, who came bearing gifts (including chocolate) to visit the court of Prince Philip. However, it was not until 1585 that the first recorded shipment of cocoa beans arrived in Spain from Veracruz, Mexico. Sweetened and flavoured with cinnamon and vanilla, chocolate was served as a hot beverage and became quite popular in the Spanish court. It was many years before chocolate had its introduction to France, England, and beyond.\n\nengraving of an Aztec with cocoa beans and chocolate beverage \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican with his chocolate pot and goblet,\xe2\x80\x9d an engraving of an Aztec with cocoa beans and chocolate beverage, from a French history of chocolate, tea, and coffee, 1685. From Traitez Nouveaux and curieux du caf\xc3\xa9 du th\xc3\xa9 et du chocolate, by Philippe Sylvestre Dufour, 1685\n\nIn 1657 a Frenchman opened a shop in London at which solid chocolate for making the beverage could be purchased at 10 to 15 shillings per pound. At that price only the wealthy could afford to drink it, and there appeared in London, Amsterdam, and other European capitals fashionable chocolate houses, some of which later developed into famous private clubs. In London many chocolate houses were used as political party meeting places as well as high-stakes gambling spots, notably Cocoa-Tree Chocolate-House (later the Cocoa-Tree Club), which opened in 1698, and White\xe2\x80\x99s, which was opened by Francis White in 1693 as White\xe2\x80\x99s Chocolate-House. About 1700 the English improved chocolate by the addition of milk. The reduction of the cost of the beverage was hampered in Great Britain by the imposition of high import duties on the raw cocoa bean, and it was not until the mid-19th century, when the duty was lowered to a uniform rate of one penny per pound, that chocolate became popular.\n\nMeanwhile, the making of chocolate spread overseas and grew in sophistication. Chocolate manufacture started in the American colonies in 1765 at Dorchester, Massachusetts, using beans brought in by New England sea captains from their voyages to the West Indies. James Baker financed the first mill, which was operated by an Irish immigrant, John Hanan. Waterpower was used for grinding the beans. In the Netherlands in 1828, C.J. van Houten patented a process for pressing much of the fat, or cocoa butter, from ground and roasted cocoa beans and thus obtaining cocoa powder. In 1847 the English firm of Fry and Sons combined cocoa butter with chocolate liquor and sugar to produce sweet (eating) chocolate\xe2\x80\x94the base of most chocolate confectionary\xe2\x80\x94and in 1876 Daniel Peter of Switzerland added dried milk to make milk chocolate.

"409.txt";"b'Share on Pinterest Screen Moment/Stocksy United Dark chocolate is loaded with nutrients that can positively affect your health. Made from the seed of the cacao tree, it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the best sources of antioxidants you can find. Studies show that dark chocolate can improve your health and lower the risk of heart disease. This article reviews 7 health benefits of dark chocolate or cocoa that are supported by science.\n\n1. Very nutritious If you buy quality dark chocolate with a high cocoa content, then it\xe2\x80\x99s quite nutritious. It contains a decent amount of soluble fiber and is loaded with minerals. A 100-gram bar of dark chocolate with 70\xe2\x80\x9385% cocoa contains (1): 11 grams of fiber\n\n67% of the DV for iron\n\n58% of the DV for magnesium\n\n89% of the DV for copper\n\n98% of the DV for manganese In addition, it has plenty of potassium, phosphorus, zinc, and selenium. Of course, 100 grams (3.5 ounces) is a fairly large amount and not something you should be consuming daily. These nutrients also come with 600 calories and moderate amounts of sugar. For this reason, dark chocolate is best consumed in moderation. The fatty acid profile of cocoa and dark chocolate is also good. The fats consist mostly of oleic acid (a heart-healthy fat also found in olive oil), stearic acid, and palmitic acid. The stearic acid has a neutral effect on body cholesterol. Palmitic acid can raise cholesterol levels, but it only makes up one-third of the total fat calories. Dark chocolate also contains stimulants like caffeine and theobromine, but it\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely to keep you awake at night, as the amount of caffeine is very small compared with coffee. Summary Quality dark chocolate is rich in fiber, iron, magnesium, copper, manganese, and a few other minerals.\n\n2. Powerful source of antioxidants ORAC stands for oxygen radical absorbance capacity. It\xe2\x80\x99s a measure of the antioxidant activity of foods. Basically, researchers set a bunch of free radicals (bad) against a sample of a food and see how well the antioxidants in the food can disarm the free radicals. The biological relevance of ORAC values is questioned, as it\xe2\x80\x99s measured in a test tube and may not have the same effect in the body. However, it\xe2\x80\x99s worth mentioning that raw, unprocessed cocoa beans are among the highest-scoring foods that have been tested. Dark chocolate is loaded with organic compounds that are biologically active and function as antioxidants. These include polyphenols, flavanols and catechins, among others. One study showed that cocoa and dark chocolate had more antioxidant activity, polyphenols, and flavanols than any other fruits tested, which included blueberries and acai berries (2). Summary Cocoa and dark chocolate have a wide variety of powerful antioxidants. In fact, they have way more than most other foods.\n\n3. May improve blood flow and lower blood pressure The flavanols in dark chocolate can stimulate the endothelium, the lining of arteries, to produce nitric oxide (NO) ( 3 ). One of the functions of NO is to send signals to the arteries to relax, which lowers the resistance to blood flow and therefore reduces blood pressure. Many controlled studies show that cocoa and dark chocolate can improve blood flow and lower blood pressure, though the effects are usually mild ( 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ). However, one study in people with high blood pressure showed no effect, so take this with a grain of salt ( 8 ). Given the great variation between studies on this subject, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that more research is needed ( 9 , 10). Summary The bioactive compounds in cocoa may improve blood flow in the arteries and cause a small but statistically significant decrease in blood pressure.\n\n4. Raises HDL and protects LDL from oxidation Consuming dark chocolate can improve several important risk factors for heart disease. In a controlled study, cocoa powder was found to significantly decrease oxidized LDL (bad) cholesterol in men. It also increased HDL and lowered total LDL for those with high cholesterol ( 11 ). Oxidized LDL means that the LDL cholesterol has reacted with free radicals. This makes the LDL particle itself reactive and capable of damaging other tissues, such as the lining of the arteries in your heart. It makes perfect sense that cocoa lowers oxidized LDL. It contains an abundance of powerful antioxidants that do make it into the bloodstream and protect lipoproteins against oxidative damage ( 12 , 13 , 14 ). The flavanols in dark chocolate can also reduce insulin resistance, which is another common risk factor for diseases like heart disease and diabetes ( 15 , 16 , 17 ). However, dark chocolate also contains sugar, which can have the opposite effect. Summary Dark chocolate improves several important risk factors for disease. It lowers the susceptibility of LDL to oxidative damage while increasing HDL and improving insulin sensitivity.\n\n5. May reduce heart disease risk The compounds in dark chocolate appear to be highly protective against the oxidation of LDL. In the long term, this should cause much less cholesterol to lodge in the arteries, resulting in a lower risk of heart disease. In fact, several long-term observational studies show a fairly drastic improvement. In a study of 470 older men, cocoa was found to reduce the risk of death from heart disease by 50% over 15 years ( 18 ). Another study revealed that eating chocolate two or more times per week lowered the risk of having calcified plaque in the arteries by 32%. Eating chocolate less frequently had no effect ( 19 ). Yet another study showed that eating dark chocolate more than five times per week lowered the risk of heart disease by 57% ( 20 ). A 2017 clinical trial found that subjects who consumed almonds with or without dark chocolate showed improved LDL cholesterol levels (21). Of course, these four studies are observational, so it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear exactly if it was the chocolate that reduced the risk. However, since the biological process is known (lower blood pressure and oxidized LDL), it\xe2\x80\x99s plausible that regularly eating dark chocolate may reduce the risk of heart disease. Summary Observational studies show a drastic reduction in heart disease risk among those who consume the most chocolate.\n\n6. May protect your skin from the sun The bioactive compounds in dark chocolate may also be great for your skin. The flavanols can protect against sun damage, improve blood flow to the skin, and increase skin density and hydration ( 22 ). The minimal erythemal dose (MED) is the minimum amount of UVB rays required to cause redness in the skin 24 hours after exposure. In one study of 30 people, the MED more than doubled after consuming dark chocolate high in flavanols for 12 weeks ( 23 ). If you\xe2\x80\x99re planning a beach vacation, consider enjoying some extra dark chocolate in the prior weeks and months. But check with your doctor or dermatologist before forgoing your normal skin care routine in favor of more dark chocolate. Summary Studies show that the flavanols from cocoa can improve blood flow to the skin and protect it from sun damage.\n\n7. Could improve brain function The good news isn\xe2\x80\x99t over yet. Dark chocolate may also improve the function of your brain. One study of healthy volunteers showed that eating high flavanol cocoa for 5 days improved blood flow to the brain ( 24 ). Cocoa may also significantly improve cognitive function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment. It may improve verbal fluency and several risk factors for disease, as well ( 25 ). Additionally, cocoa contains stimulant substances like caffeine and theobromine, which may be a key reason why it can improve brain function in the short term ( 26 ). Summary Cocoa or dark chocolate may improve brain function by increasing blood flow. It also contains stimulants like caffeine and theobromine.'";"Other";"409.txt-Other"

"419.txt";"b'When most of us hear the word chocolate, we picture a bar, a box of bonbons, or a bunny. The verb that comes to mind is probably ""eat,"" not ""drink,"" and the most apt adjective would seem to be ""sweet."" But for about 90 percent of chocolate\'s long history, it was strictly a beverage, and sugar didn\'t have anything to do with it.\n\n""I often call chocolate the best-known food that nobody knows anything about,"" said Alexandra Leaf, a self-described ""chocolate educator"" who runs a business called Chocolate Tours of New York City.\n\nThe terminology can be a little confusing, but most experts these days use the term ""cacao"" to refer to the plant or its beans before processing, while the term ""chocolate"" refers to anything made from the beans, she explained. ""Cocoa"" generally refers to chocolate in a powdered form, although it can also be a British form of ""cacao.""\n\nEtymologists trace the origin of the word ""chocolate"" to the Aztec word ""xocoatl,"" which referred to a bitter drink brewed from cacao beans. The Latin name for the cacao tree, Theobroma cacao, means ""food of the gods.""\n\nMany modern historians have estimated that chocolate has been around for about 2000 years, but recent research suggests that it may be even older.\n\nIn the book The True History of Chocolate, authors Sophie and Michael Coe make a case that the earliest linguistic evidence of chocolate consumption stretches back three or even four millennia, to pre-Columbian cultures of Mesoamerica such as the Olmec.\n\nLast November, anthropologists from the University of Pennsylvania announced the discovery of cacao residue on pottery excavated in Honduras that could date back as far as 1400 B.C.E. It appears that the sweet pulp of the cacao fruit, which surrounds the beans, was fermented into an alcoholic beverage of the time.\n\n""Who would have thought, looking at this, that you can eat it?"" said Richard Hetzler, executive chef of the caf\xc3\xa9 at the Smithsonian\'s National Museum of the American Indian, as he displayed a fresh cacao pod during a recent chocolate-making demonstration. ""You would have to be pretty hungry, and pretty creative!""\n\nIt\'s hard to pin down exactly when chocolate was born, but it\'s clear that it was cherished from the start. For several centuries in pre-modern Latin America, cacao beans were considered valuable enough to use as currency. One bean could be traded for a tamale, while 100 beans could purchase a good turkey hen, according to a 16th-century Aztec document.\n\nBoth the Mayans and Aztecs believed the cacao bean had magical, or even divine, properties, suitable for use in the most sacred rituals of birth, marriage and death. According to Chloe Doutre-Roussel\'s book The Chocolate Connoisseur, Aztec sacrifice victims who felt too melancholy to join in ritual dancing before their death were often given a gourd of chocolate (tinged with the blood of previous victims) to cheer them up. Sweetened chocolate didn\'t appear until Europeans discovered the Americas and sampled the native cuisine. Legend has it that the Aztec king Montezuma welcomed the Spanish explorer Hernando Cortes with a banquet that included drinking chocolate, having tragically mistaken him for a reincarnated deity instead of a conquering invader. Chocolate didn\'t suit the foreigners\' tastebuds at first \xe2\x80\x93one described it in his writings as ""a bitter drink for pigs"" \xe2\x80\x93 but once mixed with honey or cane sugar, it quickly became popular throughout Spain. By the 17th century, chocolate was a fashionable drink throughout Europe, believed to have nutritious, medicinal and even aphrodisiac properties (it\'s rumored that Casanova was especially fond of the stuff). But it remained largely a privilege of the rich until the invention of the steam engine made mass production possible in the late 1700s. In 1828, a Dutch chemist found a way to make powdered chocolate by removing about half the natural fat (cacao butter) from chocolate liquor, pulverizing what remained and treating the mixture with alkaline salts to cut the bitter taste. His product became known as ""Dutch cocoa,"" and it soon led to the creation of solid chocolate. The creation of the first modern chocolate bar is credited to Joseph Fry, who in 1847 discovered that he could make a moldable chocolate paste by adding melted cacao butter back into Dutch cocoa. By 1868, a little company called Cadbury was marketing boxes of chocolate candies in England. Milk chocolate hit the market a few years later, pioneered by another name that may ring a bell \xe2\x80\x93 Nestle. In America, chocolate was so valued during the Revolutionary War that it was included in soldiers\' rations and used in lieu of wages. While most of us probably wouldn\'t settle for a chocolate paycheck these days, statistics show that the humble cacao bean is still a powerful economic force. Chocolate manufacturing is a more than 4-billion-dollar industry in the United States, and the average American eats at least half a pound of the stuff per month. In the 20th century, the word ""chocolate"" expanded to include a range of affordable treats with more sugar and additives than actual cacao in them, often made from the hardiest but least flavorful of the bean varieties (forastero). But more recently, there\'s been a ""chocolate revolution,"" Leaf said, marked by an increasing interest in high-quality, handmade chocolates and sustainable, effective cacao farming and harvesting methods. Major corporations like Hershey\'s have expanded their artisanal chocolate lines by purchasing smaller producers known for premium chocolates, such as Scharffen Berger and Dagoba, while independent chocolatiers continue to flourish as well. ""I see more and more American artisans doing incredible things with chocolate,"" Leaf said. ""Although, I admit that I tend to look at the world through cocoa-tinted glasses.""'";"Other";"419.txt-Other"
"423.txt";"b'Is Chocolate Good for Your Heart?\n\nWhy a little, in moderation, may be beneficial\n\nChocolate has gotten a lot of media coverage in recent years because it\'s believed that it may help protect your cardiovascular system. The reasoning being that the cocoa bean is rich in a class of plant nutrients called flavonoids.\n\nFlavonoids help protect plants from environmental toxins and help repair damage. They can be found in a variety of foods, such as fruits and vegetables. When we eat foods rich in flavonoids, it appears that we also benefit from this ""antioxidant"" power.\n\nAntioxidants are believed to help the body\'s cells resist damage caused by free radicals that are formed by normal bodily processes, such as breathing, and from environmental contaminants, like cigarette smoke. If your body does not have enough antioxidants to combat the amount of oxidation that occurs, it can become damaged by free radicals. For example, an increase in oxidation can cause low-density lipoprotein (LDL), also known as ""bad"" cholesterol, to form plaque on the artery walls.\n\nFlavanols are the main type of flavonoid found in cocoa and chocolate. In addition to having antioxidant qualities, research shows that flavanols have other potential influences on vascular health, such as lowering blood pressure, improving blood flow to the brain and heart, and making blood platelets less sticky and able to clot.\n\nThese plant chemicals aren\xe2\x80\x99t only found in chocolate. In fact, a wide variety of foods and beverages are rich in flavonols. These include cranberries, apples, peanuts, onions, tea and red wine.\n\nAre all types of chocolate healthy?\n\nBefore you grab a chocolate candy bar or slice of chocolate cake, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand that not all forms of chocolate contain high levels of flavanols.\n\nCocoa naturally has a very strong, pungent taste, which comes from the flavanols. When cocoa is processed into your favorite chocolate products, it goes through several steps to reduce this taste. The more chocolate is processed (through things like fermentation, alkalizing, roasting, etc.), the more flavanols are lost.\n\nMost commercial chocolates are highly processed. Although it was once believed that dark chocolate contained the highest levels of flavanols, recent research indicates that, depending on how the dark chocolate was processed, this may not be true. The good news is that most major chocolate manufacturers are looking for ways to keep the flavanols in their processed chocolates. But for now, your best choices are likely dark chocolate over milk chocolate (especially milk chocolate that is loaded with other fats and sugars) and cocoa powder that has not undergone Dutch processing (cocoa that is treated with an alkali to neutralize its natural acidity).\n\nWhat about all of the fat in chocolate?\n\nYou may be surprised to learn that chocolate isn\xe2\x80\x99t as bad for you as once believed.\n\nThe fat in chocolate comes from cocoa butter and is made up of equal amounts of oleic acid (a heart-healthy monounsaturated fat also found in olive oil), stearic and palmitic acids. Stearic and palmitic acids are forms of saturated fat. You may know that saturated fats are linked to increases in LDL cholesterol and the risk of heart disease.\n\nBut, research shows that stearic acid appears to have a neutral effect on cholesterol, neither raising nor lowering it. Although palmitic acid does affect cholesterol levels, it only makes up one-third of the fat calories in chocolate. Still, this does not mean you can eat all the dark chocolate you\xe2\x80\x99d like.\n\nFirst, be careful about the type of dark chocolate you choose: chewy caramel-marshmallow-nut-covered dark chocolate is by no means a heart-healthy food option. Watch out for those extra ingredients that can add lots of extra fat and calories. Second, there is currently no established serving size of chocolate to help you reap the cardiovascular benefits it may offer, and more research is needed in this area. However, we do know that you no longer need to feel guilty if you enjoy a small piece of dark chocolate once in a while.\n\nSo, for now, enjoy moderate portions of chocolate (e.g., 1 ounce) a few times per week, and don\xe2\x80\x99t forget to eat other flavonoid-rich foods like apples, red wine, tea, onions and cranberries.'";"Other";"423.txt-Other"

"430.txt";"b""Originally consumed as a bitter drink, it was prized as both an aphrodisiac and an energy booster.\n\nMankind\xe2\x80\x99s love affair with chocolate stretches back more than five millennia. Produced from the seeds of tropical cacao trees native to the rainforests of Central and South America, chocolate was long considered the \xe2\x80\x9cfood of the gods,\xe2\x80\x9d and later, a delicacy for the elite. But for most of its history, it was actually consumed as a bitter beverage rather than the sweet, edible treat it has become worldwide.\n\nWhat Is the Birthplace of Chocolate?\n\nMayan cacao drink Ren Photo/Getty Images\n\nArchaeologists have discovered the earliest traces of cacao in pottery used by the ancient Mayo-Chinchipe culture 5,300 years ago in the upper Amazon region of Ecuador. Chocolate played an important political, spiritual and economic role in ancient Mesoamerican civilizations, which ground roasted cacao beans into a paste that they mixed with water, vanilla, chili peppers and other spices to brew a frothy chocolate drink.\n\nAncient Mesoamericans believed chocolate was an energy booster and aphrodisiac with mystical and medicinal qualities. The Mayans, who considered cacao a gift from the gods, used chocolate for sacred ceremonies and funeral offerings. Wealthy Mayans drank foaming chocolate drinks, while commoners consumed chocolate in a cold porridge-like dish.\n\nAs people of the Aztec empire spread across Mesoamerica in the 1400s, they too began to prize cacao. Since they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t grow it in the dry highlands of central Mexico, they traded with the Mayans for the beans, which they even used as currency. (In the 1500s, Aztecs could purchase a turkey hen or a hare for 100 beans.) By one account, the 16th-century Aztec ruler Moctezuma II drank 50 cups of chocolate a day out of a golden goblet to increase his libido.\n\nWATCH: Season 1 of The Food That Built America without signing in now.\n\nSpaniards Introduce Chocolate to Europe\xe2\x80\x99s Elite\n\nChocolate arrived in Europe during the 1500s, likely brought by both Spanish friars and conquistadors who had traveled to the Americas. Although the Spanish sweetened the bitter drink with cane sugar and cinnamon, one thing remained unchanged: Chocolate reigned as a delectable symbol of luxury, wealth and power\xe2\x80\x94an expensive import sipped by royal lips, and affordable only to Spanish elites.\n\nChocolate\xe2\x80\x99s popularity eventually spread to other European courts, where aristocrats consumed it as a magic elixir with health benefits. To slake their growing thirst for chocolate, European powers established colonial plantations in equatorial regions around the world to grow cacao and sugar. When diseases brought by Europeans depleted the native Mesoamerican labor pool, African slaves were imported to the Americas to work on the plantations and maintain chocolate production.\n\nChocolate remained an aristocratic nectar until the 1828 invention of the cocoa press revolutionized its production. Attributed in varying accounts to either Dutch chemist Coenraad Johannes van Houten or his father, Casparus, the cocoa press squeezed the fatty butter from roasted cacao beans, leaving behind a dry cake that could be pulverized into a fine powder that could be mixed with liquids and other ingredients, poured into molds and solidified into edible, easily digestible chocolate. The cocoa press ushered in the modern era of chocolate by enabling it to be used as a confectionary ingredient, and the resulting drop in production costs made chocolate much more affordable.\n\nREAD MORE: Why the Candy Bar Market Exploded After WWI\n\nChocolate Becomes a Treat for the Masses\n\n10 Gallery 10 Images\n\nIn 1847, British chocolate company J.S. Fry & Sons created the first edible chocolate bar from cocoa butter, cocoa powder and sugar. Rival chocolatier Cadbury\xe2\x80\x99s, credited with pioneering the Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day chocolate box and chocolate Easter egg, followed suit soon after and in 1854 earned a royal warrant as purveyors of chocolate to Queen Victoria.\n\nIt was in Switzerland that chocolate production took one of its greatest leaps forward. In the 1870s, Swiss chocolatier Daniel Peter utilized a powdered milk developed several years earlier by his neighbor Henri Nestl\xc3\xa9 to produce the first milk chocolate bar, and the pair eventually formed the Nestl\xc3\xa9 Company. Swiss chocolatier Rodolphe Lindt\xe2\x80\x99s 1879 invention of the conching machine\xe2\x80\x94which used large stone rollers to mix and aerate chocolate to give it a velvety texture and superior taste\xe2\x80\x94allowed for the mass production of smooth, creamy milk chocolate.\n\nIn the United States, Milton Hershey pioneered the assembly-line production of milk chocolate. After selling his caramel candy company for $1 million and producing his first milk chocolate bar in 1900, Hershey bought farmland near his birthplace in rural Pennsylvania and built an entire factory town devoted to chocolate.

"457.txt";"b'Cocoa butter composition\n\nPrior to any refining, the fatty-acid composition of the CB used in this study was determined by gas-liquid chromatography. The CB used in this study is mainly composed of stearic acid (37.3%), palmitic acid (25.4%), and oleic acid (33.5%) (Supplementary Table 1), which closely matches typical literature values4. The phosphorus content of the unrefined CB is 88 \xc2\xb1 1 ppm, or 0.263 \xc2\xb1 0.004% equivalent phosphatides by weight (Supplementary Table 2), which is similar to the 0.34 \xc2\xb1 0.07% reported by Arruda and Dimick6. After refining, the phospholipids are completely removed from the CB. The FFA content of the unrefined CB is 1.65 \xc2\xb1 0.01% (as oleic acid) (Supplementary Table 3), which complies with the requirement of having <1.75% FFAs as oleic acid in Codex standards. This is reduced to 0.06% after neutralization and bleaching.\n\nCrystal structure and polymorphism\n\nPowder X-ray diffraction is the most unambiguous method for determining CB TAG polymorphism. In this study, CB samples were melted at 80 \xc2\xb0C for 30 min to clear the memory of crystallization and then crystallized statically at 23 \xc2\xb0C in an incubator for 1 day. Form IV displays wide-angle reflections corresponding to short spacings of 4.35, 4.15, 3.97, and 3.81 \xc3\x85, Form V has short spacings of 4.58, 3.98, 3.87, 3.75, and 3.67 \xc3\x85, while Form VI has short spacings of 4.59, 3.86, and 3.70 \xc3\x8510. Unrefined CB displays reflections corresponding to short spacings of 4.61, 3.88, and 3.71 \xc3\x85, which is characteristic of Form VI, matching literature values closely (Fig. 1; Supplementary Table 4)10. Additionally, the small-angle reflections corresponding to long spacings of 68.16 and 32.89 \xc3\x85 further suggest a Form VI polymorphism and a 3 L structure (polytype)11. CB TAGs in Forms V and VI stack as lamellae in the [001] direction with a dimension, which is proportional to three fatty-acid chain lengths, hence the nomenclature \xe2\x80\x9c3 L\xe2\x80\x9d. Other polymorphic forms stack as 2 L structures, the more common polytypic arrangement12.\n\nFig. 1: Powder X-ray diffraction patterns and differential scanning calorimetric traces (inset) of unrefined native CB, refined CB, and refined CB with added minor lipidic components. Samples included a unrefined native CB, b refined CB, c refined CB with added 0.1% (w/w) dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, and d refined CB with added 0.1% (w/w) dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine. Samples were crystallized statically at 23 \xc2\xb0C for 24 h. Full size image\n\nIn contrast, the refined CB sample displays a pattern that resembles a blend of Forms IV and V. Short spacings of 4.35 and 4.18 \xc3\x85 agree with literature values for Form IV, while 4.60, 3.99, 3.88, and 3.77 \xc3\x85 match those of Form V11. Furthermore, the long spacings include both 2 L (45.20 \xc3\x85) and 3 L (65.57 and 32.69 \xc3\x85) arrangements, indicative of the presence of Forms IV and V, respectively11. Thus, it appears that the removal of minor components in CB through refining drastically changes the crystal structure of CB.\n\nThe wide-angle region of powder XRD spectra of refined CB with minor components added back is generally characteristic of Form V, or a blend of Forms IV and V (Fig. 1c, d and Supplementary Fig. 1 (a\xe2\x80\x93f)). In the small-angle region, diffraction patterns suggest that the 3 L structure is present in all samples. Long spacings in the range 64\xe2\x80\x9368 \xc3\x85 correspond to the reflections of the (001) crystal plane. Higher-order reflections, up to ones corresponding to the (009) plane of this lamellar crystal, are also evident. However, there is also varying amounts of the 2 L structure present in the various samples, specifically Form IV, which imparts undesirable properties and stability to CB and chocolate, including a low melting point and excessive softness12. The DMPC, GMP, GMO, and FFA samples have little to no 2 L structure present, indicated by the lack of a (001) plane reflection corresponding to ~45 \xc3\x85. In contrast, DPPE and GMS CB samples display a strong 2 L reflection, suggesting a mixture of 2 L and 3 L structures.\n\nMelting point and enthalpy of fusion\n\nThe melting points and enthalpies of fusion determined by DSC were compared across the CB samples and are shown in Table 1. Example DSC curves are presented for each sample in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2. Wille and Lutton reported the melting temperatures for Forms I through VI as 17.3, 23.3. 25.5, 27.5, 33.9, and 36.3 \xc2\xb0C10, while Lovegren et al.13 reported lower melting temperatures for the same six polymorphs as 13, 20, 23, 25, 30, and 33.5 \xc2\xb0C. The melting point of the unrefined CB used in our study closely matches that of Form VI, as reported by Willie and Lutton10. However, once the CB is refined, the melting point drops to 28.8 \xc2\xb0C, indicative of Form IV. After adding specific minor components back into the refined CB, the melting temperature increases again. Phospholipid and MAG addition to refined CB yield samples with melting points in the range of 29.8\xe2\x80\x9332.2 \xc2\xb0C, suggesting that the CB crystals are in transition from Form IV to Form V, as reported by Wille and Lutton10. Finally, when FFAs are added to refined CB, the melting temperature increases back to about 34 \xc2\xb0C, which may indicate a mixture of Forms V and VI, as it is also similar to Form VI\xe2\x80\x99s melting point of 33.5 \xc2\xb0C13. These results are all in agreement with the XRD data.\n\nTable 1 Melting point and enthalpy of fusion of unrefined native CB, refined CB, and refined CB with added minor lipidic components. Full size table\n\nThe enthalpies of fusion follow a similar trend, with a higher enthalpy of fusion (143.9 J/g) for unrefined CB, which decreases significantly after refining (110.9 J/g). Again, the phospholipids and MAGs have a much smaller effect, if any, compared to the FFAs. With the FFA samples, the enthalpies of fusion are similar to that of the unrefined CB. Guthrie reported an enthalpy of 147 J/g for Form V CB, which decreased for less stable forms14.\n\nCrystallization kinetics\n\nThe crystallization kinetics of the CB samples were quantified using half-times derived from the Avrami model fitted to the SFC-temperature data, as shown in Fig. 2, with the calculated Avrami constants shown in Supplementary Table 515.\n\nFig. 2: Static crystallization growth curve of unrefined native CB, refined CB, and refined CB with added minor lipidic components crystallized at 23 \xc2\xb0C (symbols) and corresponding fits to the Avrami model (solid lines). The inset table indicates the half-times of crystallization derived form model fits. Refining CB accelerates its crystallization (a), as does 0.1% (w/w) phospholipid addition (b). Addition of 0.5% (w/w) saturated monoacylglycerols, glycerol monostearate, and glycerol monopalmitate, do not significantly affect crystallization kinetics, while addition of the unsaturated glycerol monooletate does (c). Free fatty-acid addition to refined CB at 0.5% (w/w) levels accelerates crystallization for stearic, palmitic, and oleic acids equally (d). Values represent means and standard errors of three replicates and values with the same superscript letter are not significantly different (P > 0.05). Full size image\n\nUnrefined CB has the longest half-time of crystallization at 281.9 min, which decreases to 202.3 min after refining. Statistically significant decreases (P < 0.05) in the half time of crystallization of unrefined CB are observed after addition of DMPC, DPPE, GMO, and all free fatty acids tested, including palmitic, stearic, and oleic acids. Chaiseri and Dimick reported that different phospholipids had different effects on crystallization rate, with certain phospholipids such as lysophosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol retarding nucleation, while others such as phosphatidylcholine promoting nucleation. They also highlighted that removing phospholipids through refining decreased the crystallization rate, indicating that phospholids may be necessary as initial crystallization seeds in CB1. This agrees with the data presented in this study, with the addition of phospholipids increasing crystallization rate. Arruda and Dimick reported a much higher relative concentration of phospholipids in seed crystals than in bulk CB, with the majority being phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine6. Thus, it appears that the added phospholipids may aid in the nucleation of CB TAGs.\n\nThe FFA and GMO CB samples have a slightly shorter half-time of crystallization relative to the refined CB sample, but the effects of palmitic and oleic acid are not statistically significant (P > 0.05). M\xc3\xbcller and Careglio focused their study specifically on FFAs, and reported slower crystal growth of unrefined CB with added stearic, palmitic, and oleic acids7. However, we do not observe this in our study. Chaiseri and Dimick reported that saturated free fatty acids increased the crystallization rate in the early stages of CB crystallization1.\n\nFew studies have been conducted on the effect of MAGs on CB crystallization. Chaiseri and Dimick suggested that their effects are small due to their low concentration in CB1. In our study, GMS and GMP, both saturated monoglycerides, do not significantly affect CB crystallization kinetics. Surprisingly, the unsaturated monoglyceride GMO enhances CB crystallization.\n\nPolarized light microscopy\n\nLight microscopy revealed subtle differences in the microstructure of the different CB samples (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 3). Although all images display feather-like spherulitic structures, the unrefined sample has smaller spherulites. DPPE addition, interestingly, leads to the formation of larger spherulites with a different texture than upon DMPC addition. The spherulites of the refined and DPPE samples display granular structures in the centre of the spherulites and feather-like crystallites in the periphery. The MAG samples all exhibit similar crystal morphologies, with both granular structures and small feather-like spherulites present. This is similar to the stearic and palmitic acid samples, though the FFA samples display a more granular structure. It appears that the MAG and FFA samples, excluding the oleic acid sample, revert the CB to the morphology of the unrefined sample. However, the oleic acid sample differs greatly from the rest, displaying large spherulites analogous to the refined CB sample.\n\nFig. 3: Polarized light microscopy images of unrefined native CB, refined CB, and refined CB with and without added minor lipidic components. Samples included a unrefined native CB, b refined CB, c refined CB with added 0.1% (w/w) dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, and d refined CB with added 0.1% (w/w) dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine. Samples were crystallized statically at 23 \xc2\xb0C for 24 h. Intensity and contrast were auto-levelled. Full size image\n\nAn aspect that became clear during the microscopy studies is that the spatial distribution of mass of CB is affected by the refining process and subsequent addition of minor lipidic components. One way to quantify this spatial distribution of mass is by determining the box-counting fractal dimension (D box ) of the images. A high fractal dimension is associated with a greater fill of the available embedding space with crystalline mass, as well as a higher order in the distribution of this crystalline mass. The box-counting fractal dimension provides a value that quantifies the level of space-filling, as well as self-similarity within a structure, which can be related to the nucleation process of CB. Supplementary Table 6 lists these values. The unrefined and stearic acid samples have the lowest average fractal dimension, with D box = 1.63 and 1.62, respectively. In contrast, the sample with the highest fractal dimension is the refined sample at D box = 1.75, followed by the phospholipid samples at ~1.72. Samples with a higher fractal dimension are expected to have originated from a higher nucleation rate, as this leads to more homogenous growth across an area. On the other hand, slower nucleation rates would result in more heterogeneous growth, leading to a lower fractal dimension for the resulting mass distribution 16.\n\nInterestingly, here we also discovered a statistically significant (r = 0.77, P < 0.01) inverse correlation between the melting temperature of the samples and their fractal dimension, as shown in Fig. 4. This may be related to the polymorphism of each sample and its corresponding nucleation process. For the unrefined sample, a high melting temperature of 36.4 \xc2\xb0C indicates the presence of the Form VI polymorph. The higher free energy of nucleation for this most stable polymorph results in low nucleation rates, leading to a more heterogeneous mass distribution and a lower fractal dimension. Conversely, the lower melting temperature of the refined sample suggests a mixture of Forms IV and V, which are metastable polymorphs. These polymorphic forms have greater rates of nucleation, resulting in a more homogeneous mass distribution and a higher fractal dimension16.\n\nFig. 4: Global relationship between the box-counting fractal dimension (D box ) of polarized light microscopy images of CB samples and their corresponding melting temperature (T m ). Fractal dimension values plotted represent the means of six images, while melting temperature values plotted represent the means of three replicates. Full size image\n\nMechanical properties\n\nThe hardness of both CB and chocolate samples containing some of the minor components was determined by 3-point bending, and the elastic bending modulus calculated. The elastic bending moduli (E B ) of unrefined CB, refined CB, and DMPC CB are 44.1 \xc2\xb1 3.4, 35.4 \xc2\xb1 4.4, and 39.0 \xc2\xb1 3.7 N/mm2, respectively. There is no statistically significant difference between these values (P > 0.05). The melting temperatures for these samples are the same as well, with the average being 34.3 \xc2\xb1 0.1 \xc2\xb0C.\n\nFor the chocolate samples, the addition of phospholipids to molten commercial chocolate (90% cocoa solids) allows the chocolate to maintain hardness without complex tempering procedures, such as crystallization at 5 \xc2\xb0C for 1 h and subsequent storage at 20 \xc2\xb0C for 4 days. Other trials with static crystallization at 23 and 26 \xc2\xb0C yield chocolates with undesirable mechanical and surface properties, suggesting that the use of phospholipids to promote proper tempering still requires some optimization of crystallization temperatures. DMPC and DPPE were added chocolate at 0.1% (w/w) levels, and their properties were compared to commercial chocolate both directly from the package and recrystallized under the same conditions as the doped samples (Table 2). The E B is similar between the commercial chocolate and the phospholipid-containing samples, but is significantly lower for the recrystallized commercial chocolate (P < 0.05). When the chocolate is melted and recrystallized without any additive addition, it becomes much softer. A greater E B indicates a stiffer chocolate, relating to the property of snap, which is desirable in chocolate. However, DSC analysis revealed that all the chocolate samples have similar melting temperatures, all indicative of Form V CB crystals. XRD patterns further confirm the presence of Form V CB crystals in all samples (Fig. 5). Thus, it appears that the polymorphism of CB in chocolate does not wholly determine its mechanical properties, and these mechanical properties may be attributed to the microstructure instead.\n\nTable 2 Elastic bending modulus (E B ), melting temperature, and whiteness index (WI) of commercial chocolate samples with added phospholipids. Full size table\n\nFig. 5: Powder X-ray diffraction patterns for commercial chocolate with added minor lipidic components. Chocolate samples were molten, blended with the minor components and crystallized at 5 \xc2\xb0C for 1 h, followed by 20 \xc2\xb0C for 4 days. The a commercial chocolate, b molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate, c molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added 0.1% (w/w) dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, and d molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added 0.1% (w/w) dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine, all display powder X-ray diffraction patterns characteristic of well-tempered \xce\xb2 2 , triclinic, Form V cocoa butter crystals. This crystal form displays a strong reflection corresponding to a short spacing of ~4.6 \xc3\x85 in the wide-angle diffraction region, and characteristic wide-angle reflections in the 2\xce\xb8 region 20\xe2\x80\x9325\xc2\xb0. In the small-angle diffraction region, only reflections from the 3 L (001) plane corresponding to ~62\xe2\x80\x9363-\xc3\x85 were observed. The absence of reflections from (001) plane of the 2 L polytype indicates the formation of the optimal polytypic form in the cocoa butter in all samples. Reflections at higher angles in the small-angle region correspond to higher-order reflections for these two crystal planes. Full size image\n\nProper chocolate tempering typically focuses on the melting behavior of the chocolate, in other words, the polymorphism of the chocolate\xe2\x80\x99s CB triacylglycerol crystals2,3. However, there is little consideration for the microstructure and mechanical properties when determining whether chocolate has been properly tempered or not. Here we show that addition of DMPC and DPPE helps achieve the desired hardness and fracture properties in chocolate, without directly impacting the polymorphism. This likely results from changes in the microstructure of the underlying CB fat crystal network, which arises from the phospholipids affecting the nucleation behavior of the CB.\n\nSurface reflectance\n\nProper tempering of chocolate results in a smooth surface with high surface gloss17. Bloom, for example, is often characterized by the appearance of a grayish white film on the surface of chocolate, attributed to the uncontrolled polymorphic transformation from Form V to Form VI18. This white appearance is due to the presence of large surface crystals, which scatter light impinging upon them19. This can be quantified using the Whiteness Index (WI), calculated from RGB surface color measurements17. A higher WI indicates a greater level of fat bloom on the surface of the chocolate, or may also indicate a rougher surface. The WI for each of the chocolate samples is shown in Table 2. The commercial chocolate and the DMPC chocolate sample have similar WI, suggesting a properly tempered chocolate for the DMPC sample. Moreover, a statistically significant difference is evident between the DMPC chocolate sample and the recrystallized commercial chocolate sample (P < 0.05), which was not tempered properly. The lower WI of the DMPC chocolate sample suggests that the addition of this phospholipid aided in the stability of the chocolate, resulting in less fat bloom and/or a smoother surface compared to the recrystallized commercial chocolate sample. The effect of DPPE addition to molten and recrystallized chocolate is not as clear since the WI is not statistically different from the commercial, DMPC or molten and recrystallized chocolates.\n\nChocolate microstructure by synchrotron-based micro-computed tomography (SR-\xc2\xb5CT)\n\nSynchrotron \xc2\xb5CT analysis revealed similarities between chocolate microstructure among all samples imaged at a <450 \xc2\xb5m length scale. CT voxel intensity is directly proportional to material density. The number of voxels with a given intensity is then representative of the number of volume fractions with a given density in the analyzed volume. The molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate sample (Lindt-R) displays the largest difference between samples, with a narrowing and shift of the histogram compared to the fresh commercial chocolate (Lindt-F), molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added DMPC, and molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added DPPE. This indicates a difference in material structure upon recrystallization. This is visually represented in volume renderings where the most notable difference is a reduction in the green intensity for Lindt-R, compared to the Lindt-F, DMPC, and DPPE samples, as seen in Fig. 6. Volume rendering movies of each sample can be seen in the corresponding links in Fig. 6.\n\nFig. 6: Volume renderings of reconstructed slices, plotted histograms, and correlation matrix of SR-\xc2\xb5CT data. Samples included a molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added 0.1% (w/w) dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC), Supplementary Movie 1; b molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added 0.1% (w/w) dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DPPE), Supplementary Movie 2; c fresh commercial chocolate (Lindt-F), Supplementary Movie 3; d molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate (Lindt-R), Supplementary Movie 4; e plotted histograms, and f correlation matrix. Full size image\n\nA comparison of the histograms shows qualitative differences in the overall density distributions, which make up the sample volumes in the images. A correlation matrix was generated by inputting the voxel count values for each binned 16-bit gray-value and generating a table of correlation coefficients between the four chocolates density distributions. The correlation matrices show a high positive correlation in the material\xe2\x80\x99s density distribution regardless of treatment; however, the least variance is observed between DMPC vs. Lindt-F and DPPE vs. Lindt-F. The highest correlation coefficient is found between DMPC and fresh Lindt, and DPPE vs. fresh Lindt samples, with a value of 0.9987. This suggests that the complex microstructure of Lindt chocolate with added DMPC and DPPE and crystallized isothermally, is more similar to that of tempered fresh Lindt chocolate than without these additives.\n\nOverall, we find that the presence of various minor components within CB results in major changes to its polymorphism, crystallization kinetics, and crystal morphology. By refining CB through neutralization and bleaching, the unrefined CB transitioned from Form VI to a blend of Forms IV and V, in addition to displaying faster crystal growth. Although adding MAGs and FFAs back into refined CB results in some small differences, phospholipid addition has the largest impact.\n\nAt 0.1% (w/w) levels, DMPC and DPPE both significantly increase the crystal growth rate of refined CB. However, the DPPE sample exhibits significant amounts of the 2 L polytype, while the DMPC sample only displays 3 L polytypism, which is the more stable and preferred nanostructure. When added to a commercial chocolate sample, DMPC and DPPE both template the Form V polymorph with optimal mechanical properties, surface gloss and microstructure. This may allow for the production of chocolate products without the need for laborious and complex tempering protocols.\n\nProper tempering is often judged by the resulting melting temperature, a function of the CB polymorphic form2. However, as we show in this study, the various chocolate samples were all in Form V as determined by DSC and XRD analysis, but display different mechanical properties. This suggests that there is more to tempering than achieving the Form V polymorph, and important qualities such as gloss and snap may be heavily dependent on surface and bulk microstructure. Thus, DMPC, DPPE, and possibly other saturated phospholipids can potentially be employed as effective additives for engineering the crystallization behavior, polymorphism, nanostructure, and microstructure in CB and chocolate products.'";"Other";"457.txt-Other"
"466.txt";"b'Is chocolate toxic to dogs?\n\nYes, chocolate is toxic to dogs. While rarely fatal, chocolate ingestion can result in significant illness. Chocolate is toxic because it contains a chemical called theobromine, as well as caffeine. Theobromine is the main toxin in chocolate and is very similar to caffeine. Both chemicals are used medicinally as a diuretic, heart stimulant, blood vessel dilator, and a smooth muscle relaxant. Dogs cannot metabolize theobromine and caffeine as well as people can. That is why dogs are more sensitive to the chemicals\xe2\x80\x99 effects.\n\nHow much chocolate is poisonous to a dog?\n\nThe amount of toxic theobromine varies with the type of chocolate. The darker and more bitter the chocolate, the more dangerous it is to dogs. Baking chocolate and gourmet dark chocolate are highly concentrated and contain 130-450 mg of theobromine per ounce. Common milk chocolate only contains about 44-58 mg/ounce. White chocolate rarely poses any threat of chocolate poisoning with only 0.25 mg of theobromine per ounce of chocolate. Even if the amount ingested is not a toxicity concern, dogs can still become ill from the fat and sugar in chocolate. These can cause pancreatitis in severe cases or in dogs that have more sensitive stomachs. To put this in perspective, a medium-sized dog weighing 50 pounds would only need to eat 1 ounce of baker\'s chocolate, or 9 ounces of milk chocolate, to potentially show signs of poisoning. For many dogs, ingesting small amounts of milk chocolate is not harmful.\n\nWhat are the clinical signs of chocolate poisoning?\n\nClinical signs depend on the amount and type of chocolate ingested. For many dogs, the most common clinical signs are vomiting, diarrhea, increased thirst, panting or restlessness, excessive urination, and racing heart rate. In severe cases, symptoms can include muscle tremors, seizures, and heart failure. Complications such as developing aspiration pneumonia from vomiting, can make the prognosis for chocolate poisoning worse. When in doubt, immediate treatment by your veterinarian is recommended if a poisonous amount of chocolate is ingested.\n\n""Clinical signs of chocolate poisoning can take hours to develop and last for days.""\n\nClinical signs of chocolate poisoning can take several hours to develop. Signs due to large exposures can last for days due to the long half-life of theobromine. This means that it remains in the bloodstream for a longer period. Theobromine may be re-absorbed from the bladder, so intravenous fluids and frequent walks to encourage urination may be necessary. It is important to seek medical attention by calling your veterinarian or Pet Poison Helpline as soon as you suspect that your dog has eaten chocolate.\n\nWhat should I do if my dog eats chocolate?\n\nContact your veterinarian or Pet Poison Helpline to see if a poisonous amount of chocolate was ingested. If a toxic amount is ingested, you should have your dog examined by a veterinarian immediately. The sooner treatment begins, the better your dog\'s prognosis.\n\nWhat is the treatment for chocolate poisoning?\n\nTreatment depends on the amount and type of chocolate eaten. If treated early, decontamination including inducing vomiting and administering activated charcoal to prevent absorption of theobromine into the body may be all that is necessary. Treatments of activated charcoal may be repeated to reduce the continued resorption and recirculation of theobromine.\n\nIt is very common to provide supportive treatments such as intravenous fluid therapy to help stabilize a dog and promote theobromine excretion. All dogs ingesting a toxic amount of chocolate should be closely monitored for any signs of agitation, vomiting, diarrhea, nervousness, irregular heart rhythm, and high blood pressure. Medication to treat restlessness and other signs may also be necessary\n\nI saw a treat made for dogs that contains chocolate. Isn\'t this dangerous?\n\nMany gourmet dog treats use carob as a chocolate substitute.\n\n""Carob looks similar to chocolate and the two are often confused.""\n\nCarob looks similar to chocolate and the two are often confused. Some specialty dog bakeries will use a small amount of milk chocolate in treats. Since the amount of theobromine is typically low, this may be safe for most dogs. However, most veterinarians recommend that you avoid giving your dog chocolate in any form.\n\nPet Poison Helpline, an animal poison control center based out of Minneapolis, MN is available 24/7 for pet owners and veterinary professionals that require assistance treating a potentially poisoned pet. The staff provides treatment advice for poisoning cases of all species, including dogs, cats, birds, small mammals, large animals and exotic species. As the most cost-effective option for animal poison control care, Pet Poison Helpline\xe2\x80\x99s fee of $65 per incident includes follow-up consultations for the duration of the poison case. Pet Poison Helpline is available in North America by calling 800-213-6680. Additional information can be found online at www.petpoisonhelpline.com'";"Other";"466.txt-Other"
"501.txt";"b'Food produced from the seed of Theobroma cacao\n\nChocolate is a food product made from roasted and ground cacao pods, that is available as a liquid, solid or paste, on its own or as a flavoring agent in other foods. Cacao has been consumed in some form since at least the Olmec civilization (19th-11th century BCE),[1][2] and the majority of Mesoamerican people - including the Maya and Aztecs - made chocolate beverages.[3]\n\nThe seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor. After fermentation, the beans are dried, cleaned, and roasted. The shell is removed to produce cocoa nibs, which are then ground to cocoa mass, unadulterated chocolate in rough form. Once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating, it is called chocolate liquor. The liquor may also be cooled and processed into its two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter. Baking chocolate, also called bitter chocolate, contains cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions, without any added sugar. Powdered baking cocoa, which contains more fiber than cocoa butter, can be processed with alkali to produce dutch cocoa. Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, a combination of cocoa solids, cocoa butter or added vegetable oils, and sugar. Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder or condensed milk. White chocolate contains cocoa butter, sugar, and milk, but no cocoa solids.\n\nChocolate is one of the most popular food types and flavors in the world, and many foodstuffs involving chocolate exist, particularly desserts, including cakes, pudding, mousse, chocolate brownies, and chocolate chip cookies. Many candies are filled with or coated with sweetened chocolate. Chocolate bars, either made of solid chocolate or other ingredients coated in chocolate, are eaten as snacks. Gifts of chocolate molded into different shapes (such as eggs, hearts, coins) are traditional on certain Western holidays, including Christmas, Easter, Valentine\'s Day, and Hanukkah. Chocolate is also used in cold and hot beverages, such as chocolate milk and hot chocolate, and in some alcoholic drinks, such as creme de cacao.\n\nAlthough cocoa originated in the Americas, West African countries, particularly C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire and Ghana, are the leading producers of cocoa in the 21st century, accounting for some 60% of the world cocoa supply.\n\nWith some two million children involved in the farming of cocoa in West Africa, child slavery and trafficking were major concerns in 2018,[4][5] and continue to be. International attempts to improve conditions for children were doomed to failure because of persistent poverty, absence of schools, increasing world cocoa demand, more intensive farming of cocoa, and continued exploitation of child labor.[4]\n\nHistory\n\nMesoamerican usage\n\nTwo Mayans sit around a container of frothed chocolate.\n\nChocolate has been prepared as a drink for nearly all of its history. For example, one vessel found at an Olmec archaeological site on the Gulf Coast of Veracruz, Mexico, dates chocolate\'s preparation by pre-Olmec peoples as early as 1750 BC.[6] On the Pacific coast of Chiapas, Mexico, a Mokaya archaeological site provides evidence of cocoa beverages dating even earlier, to 1900 BC.[7][6] The residues and the kind of vessel in which they were found indicate the initial use of cocoa was not simply as a beverage, but the white pulp around the cocoa beans was likely used as a source of fermentable sugars for an alcoholic drink.[8]\n\nMan Carrying a Cacao Pod, 1440\xe2\x80\x931521. Volcanic stone, traces of red pigment. Aztec., 1440\xe2\x80\x931521. Volcanic stone, traces of red pigment. Brooklyn Museum\n\nAn early Classic-period (460\xe2\x80\x93480 AD) Mayan tomb from the site in Rio Azul had vessels with the Maya glyph for cocoa on them with residue of a chocolate drink, suggests the Maya were drinking chocolate around 400 AD.[9] Documents in Maya hieroglyphs stated chocolate was used for ceremonial purposes, in addition to everyday life.[10] The Maya grew cacao trees in their backyards,[11] and used the cocoa seeds the trees produced to make a frothy, bitter drink.[12]\n\nBy the 15th century, the Aztecs gained control of a large part of Mesoamerica and adopted cocoa into their culture. They associated chocolate with Quetzalcoatl, who, according to one legend, was cast away by the other gods for sharing chocolate with humans,[13] and identified its extrication from the pod with the removal of the human heart in sacrifice.[14] In contrast to the Maya, who liked their chocolate warm, the Aztecs drank it cold, seasoning it with a broad variety of additives, including the petals of the Cymbopetalum penduliflorum tree, chile pepper, allspice, vanilla, and honey.\n\nThe Aztecs were unable to grow cocoa themselves, as their home in the Mexican highlands was unsuitable for it, so chocolate was a luxury imported into the empire.[13] Those who lived in areas ruled by the Aztecs were required to offer cocoa seeds in payment of the tax they deemed ""tribute"".[13] Cocoa beans were often used as currency.[15] For example, the Aztecs used a system in which one turkey cost 100 cocoa beans and one fresh avocado was worth three beans.[16]\n\nThe Maya and Aztecs associated cocoa with human sacrifice, and chocolate drinks specifically with sacrificial human blood. The Spanish royal chronicler Gonzalo Fern\xc3\xa1ndez de Oviedo y Vald\xc3\xa9s described a chocolate drink he had seen in Nicaragua in 1528, mixed with achiote: ""because those people are fond of drinking human blood, to make this beverage seem like blood, they add a little achiote, so that it then turns red. ... and part of that foam is left on the lips and around the mouth, and when it is red for having achiote, it seems a horrific thing, because it seems like blood itself.""\n\nEuropean adaptation\n\nThe morning chocolate by Chocolate soon became a fashionable drink of the European nobility after the discovery of the Americas.by Pietro Longhi ; Venice, 1775\xe2\x80\x931780\n\nUntil the 16th century, no European had ever heard of the popular drink from the Central American peoples.[13] Christopher Columbus and his son Ferdinand encountered the cocoa bean on Columbus\'s fourth mission to the Americas on 15 August 1502, when he and his crew seized a large native canoe that proved to contain cocoa beans among other goods for trade.[19] Spanish conquistador Hern\xc3\xa1n Cort\xc3\xa9s may have been the first European to encounter it, as the frothy drink was part of the after-dinner routine of Montezuma.[9][20] Jos\xc3\xa9 de Acosta, a Spanish Jesuit missionary who lived in Peru and then Mexico in the later 16th century, wrote of its growing influence on the Spaniards:\n\nAlthough bananas are more profitable, cocoa is more highly esteemed in Mexico. . . Cocoa is a smaller fruit than almonds and thicker, which toasted do not taste bad. It is so prized among the Indians and even among Spaniards. . . because since it is a dried fruit it can be stored for a long time without deterioration, and they brings ships loaded with them from the province of Guatemala. . . It also serves as currency, because with five cocoas you can buy one thing, with thirty another, and with a hundred something else, without there being contradiction; and they give these cocoas as alms to the poor who beg for them. The principal product of this cocoa is a concoction which they make that they call \xe2\x80\x9cchocolate,\xe2\x80\x9d which is a crazy thing treasured in that land, and those who are not accustomed are disgusted by it, because it has a foam on top and a bubbling like that of feces, which certainly takes a lot to put up with. Anyway, it is the prized beverage which the Indians offer to nobles who come to or pass through their lands; and the Spaniards, especially Spanish women born in those lands die for black chocolate. This aforementioned chocolate is said to the be made in various forms and temperaments, hot, cold, and lukewarm. They are wont to use spices and much chili; they also make it into a paste, and it is said that it is a medicine to treat coughs, the stomach, and colds. Whatever may be the case, in fact those who have not been reared on this opinion are not appetized by it.[21]\n\n""Trait\xc3\xa9s nouveaux & curieux du caf\xc3\xa9 du th\xc3\xa9 et du chocolate"", by Philippe Sylvestre Dufour, 1685 , by Philippe Sylvestre Dufour, 1685\n\nWhile Columbus had taken cocoa beans with him back to Spain,[19] chocolate made no impact until Spanish friars introduced it to the Spanish court.[13] After the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs, chocolate was imported to Europe. There, it quickly became a court favorite. It was still served as a beverage, but the Spanish added sugar, as well as honey (the original sweetener used by the Aztecs for chocolate), to counteract the natural bitterness.[22] Vanilla, another indigenous American introduction, was also a popular additive, with pepper and other spices sometimes used to give the illusion of a more potent vanilla flavor. Unfortunately, these spices tended to unsettle the European constitution; the Encyclop\xc3\xa9die states, ""The pleasant scent and sublime taste it imparts to chocolate have made it highly recommended; but a long experience having shown that it could potentially upset one\'s stomach"", which is why chocolate without vanilla was sometimes referred to as ""healthy chocolate"".[23] By 1602, chocolate had made its way from Spain to Austria.[24] By 1662, Pope Alexander VII had declared that religious fasts were not broken by consuming chocolate drinks. Within about a hundred years, chocolate established a foothold throughout Europe.[13]\n\nmoulinet or swizzle stick, London 1714\xe2\x80\x9315 ( Silver chocolate pot with hinged finial to insert aor swizzle stick, London 1714\xe2\x80\x9315 ( Victoria and Albert Museum\n\nThe new craze for chocolate brought with it a thriving slave market, as between the early 1600s and late 1800s, the laborious and slow processing of the cocoa bean was manual.[13] Cocoa plantations spread, as the English, Dutch, and French colonized and planted. With the depletion of Mesoamerican workers, largely to disease, cocoa production was often the work of poor wage laborers and African slaves. Wind-powered and horse-drawn mills were used to speed production, augmenting human labor. Heating the working areas of the table-mill, an innovation that emerged in France in 1732, also assisted in extraction.[25]\n\nNew processes that sped the production of chocolate emerged early in the Industrial Revolution. In 1815, Dutch chemist Coenraad van Houten introduced alkaline salts to chocolate, which reduced its bitterness.[13] A few years thereafter, in 1828, he created a press to remove about half the natural fat (cocoa butter or cocoa butter) from chocolate liquor, which made chocolate both cheaper to produce and more consistent in quality. This innovation introduced the modern era of chocolate.[19]\n\nKnown as ""Dutch cocoa"", this machine-pressed chocolate was instrumental in the transformation of chocolate to its solid form when, in 1847, English chocolatier Joseph Fry discovered a way to make chocolate moldable when he mixed the ingredients of cocoa powder and sugar with melted cocoa butter.[22] Subsequently, his chocolate factory, Fry\'s of Bristol, England, began mass-producing chocolate bars, Fry\'s Chocolate Cream, launched in 1866, and they became very popular.[26] Milk had sometimes been used as an addition to chocolate beverages since the mid-17th century, but in 1875 Swiss chocolatier Daniel Peter invented milk chocolate by mixing a powdered milk developed by Henri Nestl\xc3\xa9 with the liquor.[13][19] In 1879, the texture and taste of chocolate was further improved when Rudolphe Lindt invented the conching machine.[27]\n\nBesides Nestl\xc3\xa9, several notable chocolate companies had their start in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Rowntree\'s of York set up and began producing chocolate in 1862, after buying out the Tuke family business. Cadbury was manufacturing boxed chocolates in England by 1868.[13] Manufacturing their first Easter egg in 1875, Cadbury created the modern chocolate Easter egg after developing a pure cocoa butter that could easily be molded into smooth shapes.[28] In 1893, Milton S. Hershey purchased chocolate processing equipment at the World\'s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, and soon began the career of Hershey\'s chocolates with chocolate-coated caramels.\n\nIntroduction to the United States\n\nThe Baker Chocolate Company, which makes Baker\'s Chocolate, is the oldest producer of chocolate in the United States. In 1765 Dr. James Baker and John Hannon founded the company in Boston. Using cocoa beans from the West Indies, the pair built their chocolate business, which is still in operation.[29][30]\n\nWhite chocolate was first introduced to the U.S. in 1946 by Frederick E. Hebert of Hebert Candies in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, near Boston, after he had tasted ""white coat"" candies while traveling in Europe.[31][30]\n\nEtymology\n\nCocoa, pronounced by the Olmecs as kakawa,[1] dates to 1000 BC or earlier.[1] The word ""chocolate"" entered the English language from Spanish in about 1600.[32] The word entered Spanish from the word chocol\xc4\x81tl in Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs. The origin of the Nahuatl word is uncertain, as it does not appear in any early Nahuatl source, where the word for chocolate drink is cacahuatl, ""cocoa water"". It is possible that the Spaniards coined the word (perhaps in order to avoid caca, a vulgar Spanish word for ""faeces"") by combining the Yucatec Mayan word chocol, ""hot"", with the Nahuatl word atl, ""water"". A widely-cited proposal is that the derives from unattested xocolatl meaning ""bitter drink"" is unsupported; the change from x- to ch- is unexplained, as is the -l-. Another proposed etymology derives it from the word chicolatl, meaning ""beaten drink"", which may derive from the word for the frothing stick, chicoli.[34] Other scholars reject all these proposals, considering the origin of first element of the name to be unknown.[35] The term ""chocolatier"", for a chocolate confection maker, is attested from 1888.[36]\n\nTypes\n\nChocolate is commonly used as a coating for various fruits such as cherries and/or fillings, such as liqueurs\n\nSeveral types of chocolate can be distinguished. Pure, unsweetened chocolate, often called ""baking chocolate"", contains primarily cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions. Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, which combines chocolate with sugar.\n\nMilk\n\nMilk chocolate is sweet chocolate that also contains milk powder or condensed milk. In the UK and Ireland, milk chocolate must contain a minimum of 20% total dry cocoa solids; in the rest of the European Union, the minimum is 25%.[37]\n\nWhite\n\nWhite chocolate\n\nWhite chocolate, although similar in texture to that of milk and dark chocolate, does not contain any cocoa solids that impart a dark color. In 2002, the US Food and Drug Administration established a standard for white chocolate as the ""common or usual name of products made from cocoa fat (i.e., cocoa butter), milk solids, nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners, and other safe and suitable ingredients, but containing no nonfat cocoa solids"".[38]\n\nDark\n\nDark chocolate is produced by adding fat and sugar to the cocoa mixture. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration calls this ""sweet chocolate"", and requires a 15% concentration of chocolate liquor. European rules specify a minimum of 35% cocoa solids.[37] A higher amount of cocoa solids indicates more bitterness. Semisweet chocolate is dark chocolate with low sugar content. Bittersweet chocolate is chocolate liquor to which some sugar (typically a third), more cocoa butter and vanilla are added.[39] It has less sugar and more liquor than semisweet chocolate, but the two are interchangeable in baking. It is also known to last for two years if stored properly. As of 2017 , there is no high-quality evidence that dark chocolate affects blood pressure significantly or provides other health benefits.[40]\n\nUnsweetened\n\nUnsweetened chocolate is pure chocolate liquor, also known as bitter or baking chocolate. It is unadulterated chocolate: the pure, ground, roasted chocolate beans impart a strong, deep chocolate flavor. It is typically used in baking or other products to which sugar and other ingredients are added. Raw chocolate, often referred to as raw cocoa, is always dark and a minimum of 75% cocoa.\n\nUnsweetened ""Baking"" Chocolate\n\nPoorly tempered or untempered chocolate may have whitish spots on the dark chocolate part, called chocolate bloom; it is an indication that sugar or fat has separated due to poor storage. It is not toxic and can be safely consumed.[41]\n\nProduction\n\nChocolate is created from the cocoa bean. A cacao tree with fruit pods in various stages of ripening.\n\nRoughly two-thirds of the entire world\'s cocoa is produced in West Africa, with 43% sourced from C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire,[42] where, as of 2007 , child labor is a common practice to obtain the product.[43][44] According to the World Cocoa Foundation, in 2007 some 50 million people around the world depended on cocoa as a source of livelihood.[45] As of 2007 in the UK, most chocolatiers purchase their chocolate from them, to melt, mold and package to their own design.[46] According to the WCF\'s 2012 report, the Ivory Coast is the largest producer of cocoa in the world.[47] The two main jobs associated with creating chocolate candy are chocolate makers and chocolatiers. Chocolate makers use harvested cocoa beans and other ingredients to produce couverture chocolate (covering). Chocolatiers use the finished couverture to make chocolate candies (bars, truffles, etc.).[48]\n\nProduction costs can be decreased by reducing cocoa solids content or by substituting cocoa butter with another fat. Cocoa growers object to allowing the resulting food to be called ""chocolate"", due to the risk of lower demand for their crops.[45]\n\nGenome\n\nThe sequencing in 2010 of the genome of the cacao tree may allow yields to be improved.[49] Due to concerns about global warming effects on lowland climate in the narrow band of latitudes where cocoa is grown (20 degrees north and south of the equator), the commercial company Mars, Incorporated and the University of California, Berkeley are conducting genomic research in 2017\xe2\x80\x9318 to improve the survivability of cacao plants in hot climates.[50]\n\nCacao varieties\n\nChocolate is made from cocoa beans, the dried and fermented seeds of the cacao tree (Theobroma cacao), a small, 4\xe2\x80\x938 m tall (15\xe2\x80\x9326 ft tall) evergreen tree native to the deep tropical region of the Americas. Recent genetic studies suggest the most common genotype of the plant originated in the Amazon basin and was gradually transported by humans throughout South and Central America. Early forms of another genotype have also been found in what is now Venezuela. The scientific name, Theobroma, means ""food of the gods"".[51] The fruit, called a cocoa pod, is ovoid, 15\xe2\x80\x9330 cm (6\xe2\x80\x9312 in) long and 8\xe2\x80\x9310 cm (3\xe2\x80\x934 in) wide, ripening yellow to orange, and weighing about 500 g (1.1 lb) when ripe.\n\nCacao trees are small, understory trees that need rich, well-drained soils. They naturally grow within 20\xc2\xb0 of either side of the equator because they need about 2000 mm of rainfall a year, and temperatures in the range of 21 to 32 \xc2\xb0C (70 to 90 \xc2\xb0F). Cacao trees cannot tolerate a temperature lower than 15 \xc2\xb0C (59 \xc2\xb0F).[52]\n\nThe three main varieties of cocoa beans used in chocolate are criollo, forastero, and trinitario.\n\nCriollo\n\nRepresenting only 5% of all cocoa beans grown as of 2008 ,[53] criollo is the rarest and most expensive cocoa on the market, and is native to Central America, the Caribbean islands and the northern tier of South American states.[54] The genetic purity of cocoas sold today as criollo is disputed, as most populations have been exposed to the genetic influence of other varieties.\n\nCriollos are particularly difficult to grow, as they are vulnerable to a variety of environmental threats and produce low yields of cocoa per tree. The flavor of criollo is described as delicate yet complex, low in classic chocolate flavor, but rich in ""secondary"" notes of long duration.[55]\n\nForastero\n\nThe most commonly grown bean is forastero,[53] a large group of wild and cultivated cocoas, most likely native to the Amazon basin. The African cocoa crop is entirely made up of forastero. They are significantly hardier and of higher yield than criollo. The source of most chocolate marketed,[53] forastero cocoas are typically strong in classic ""chocolate"" flavor, but have a short duration and are unsupported by secondary flavors, producing ""quite bland"" chocolate.[53]\n\nTrinitario\n\nTrinitario is a natural hybrid of criollo and forastero. Trinitario originated in Trinidad after an introduction of forastero to the local criollo crop. Nearly all cocoa produced over the past five decades is of the forastero or lower-grade trinitario varieties.[56]\n\nProcessing\n\nCocoa pods are harvested by cutting them from the tree using a machete, or by knocking them off the tree using a stick. The beans with their surrounding pulp are removed from the pods and placed in piles or bins, allowing access to micro-organisms so fermentation of the pectin-containing material can begin. Yeasts produce ethanol, lactic acid bacteria produce lactic acid, and acetic acid bacteria produce acetic acid. The fermentation process, which takes up to seven days, also produces several flavor precursors, eventually resulting in the familiar chocolate taste.[57]\n\nIt is important to harvest the pods when they are fully ripe, because if the pod is unripe, the beans will have a low cocoa butter content, or sugars in the white pulp will be insufficient for fermentation, resulting in a weak flavor. After fermentation, the beans must be quickly dried to prevent mold growth. Climate and weather permitting, this is done by spreading the beans out in the sun from five to seven days.[58]\n\nThe dried beans are then transported to a chocolate manufacturing facility. The beans are cleaned (removing twigs, stones, and other debris), roasted, and graded. Next, the shell of each bean is removed to extract the nib. Finally, the nibs are ground and liquefied, resulting in pure chocolate in fluid form: chocolate liquor.[59] The liquor can be further processed into two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter.[60]\n\nBlending\n\nChocolate liquor is blended with the cocoa butter in varying quantities to make different types of chocolate or couverture. The basic blends of ingredients for the various types of chocolate (in order of highest quantity of cocoa liquor first), are:\n\nFountain chocolate is made with high levels of cocoa butter, allowing it to flow gently over a chocolate fountain to serve as dessert fondue\n\nDark chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa liquor, and (sometimes) vanilla\n\nMilk chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa liquor, milk or milk powder, and vanilla\n\nWhite chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, milk or milk powder, and vanilla\n\nUsually, an emulsifying agent, such as soy lecithin, is added, though a few manufacturers prefer to exclude this ingredient for purity reasons and to remain GMO-free, sometimes at the cost of a perfectly smooth texture. Some manufacturers are now using PGPR, an artificial emulsifier derived from castor oil that allows them to reduce the amount of cocoa butter while maintaining the same mouthfeel.\n\nThe texture is also heavily influenced by processing, specifically conching (see below). The more expensive chocolate tends to be processed longer and thus has a smoother texture and mouthfeel, regardless of whether emulsifying agents are added.\n\nDifferent manufacturers develop their own ""signature"" blends based on the above formulas, but varying proportions of the different constituents are used. The finest, plain dark chocolate couverture contains at least 70% cocoa (both solids and butter), whereas milk chocolate usually contains up to 50%. High-quality white chocolate couverture contains only about 35% cocoa butter.\n\nProducers of high-quality, small-batch chocolate argue that mass production produces bad-quality chocolate.[53] Some mass-produced chocolate contains much less cocoa (as low as 7% in many cases), and fats other than cocoa butter. Vegetable oils and artificial vanilla flavor are often used in cheaper chocolate to mask poorly fermented and/or roasted beans.[53]\n\nIn 2007, the Chocolate Manufacturers Association in the United States, whose members include Hershey, Nestl\xc3\xa9, and Archer Daniels Midland, lobbied the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to change the legal definition of chocolate to let them substitute partially hydrogenated vegetable oils for cocoa butter, in addition to using artificial sweeteners and milk substitutes.[61] Currently, the FDA does not allow a product to be referred to as ""chocolate"" if the product contains any of these ingredients.[62][63]\n\nIn the EU a product can be sold as chocolate if it contains up to 5% vegetable oil, and must be labeled as ""family milk chocolate"" rather than ""milk chocolate"" if it contains 20% milk.[64]\n\nAccording to Canadian Food and Drug Regulations,[65] a ""chocolate product"" is a food product that is sourced from at least one ""cocoa product"" and contains at least one of the following: ""chocolate, bittersweet chocolate, semi-sweet chocolate, dark chocolate, sweet chocolate, milk chocolate, or white chocolate"". A ""cocoa product"" is defined as a food product that is sourced from cocoa beans and contains ""cocoa nibs, cocoa liquor, cocoa mass, unsweetened chocolate, bitter chocolate, chocolate liquor, cocoa, low-fat cocoa, cocoa powder, or low-fat cocoa powder"".\n\nConching\n\nChocolate melanger mixing raw ingredients\n\nThe penultimate process is called conching. A conche is a container filled with metal beads, which act as grinders. The refined and blended chocolate mass is kept in a liquid state by frictional heat. Chocolate before conching has an uneven and gritty texture. The conching process produces cocoa and sugar particles smaller than the tongue can detect (typically around 20 \xce\xbcm) and reduces rough edges, hence the smooth feel in the mouth. The length of the conching process determines the final smoothness and quality of the chocolate. High-quality chocolate is conched for about 72 hours, and lesser grades about four to six hours. After the process is complete, the chocolate mass is stored in tanks heated to about 45 to 50 \xc2\xb0C (113 to 122 \xc2\xb0F) until final processing.[66]\n\nTempering\n\nVideo of cocoa beans being ground and mixed with other ingredients to make chocolate at a Mayordomo store in Oaxaca\n\nThe final process is called tempering. Uncontrolled crystallization of cocoa butter typically results in crystals of varying size, some or all large enough to be seen with the naked eye. This causes the surface of the chocolate to appear mottled and matte, and causes the chocolate to crumble rather than snap when broken.[67][68] The uniform sheen and crisp bite of properly processed chocolate are the results of consistently small cocoa butter crystals produced by the tempering process.\n\nThe fats in cocoa butter can crystallize in six different forms (polymorphous crystallization).[67][69] The primary purpose of tempering is to assure that only the best form is present. The six different crystal forms have different properties.\n\nCrystal Melting temp. Notes I 17 \xc2\xb0C (63 \xc2\xb0F) Soft, crumbly, melts too easily II 21 \xc2\xb0C (70 \xc2\xb0F) Soft, crumbly, melts too easily III 26 \xc2\xb0C (79 \xc2\xb0F) Firm, poor snap, melts too easily IV 28 \xc2\xb0C (82 \xc2\xb0F) Firm, good snap, melts too easily V 34 \xc2\xb0C (93 \xc2\xb0F) Glossy, firm, best snap, melts near body temperature (37 \xc2\xb0C) VI 36 \xc2\xb0C (97 \xc2\xb0F) Hard, takes weeks to form\n\nMolten chocolate and a piece of a chocolate bar\n\nAs a solid piece of chocolate, the cocoa butter fat particles are in a crystalline rigid structure that gives the chocolate its solid appearance. Once heated, the crystals of the polymorphic cocoa butter can break apart from the rigid structure and allow the chocolate to obtain a more fluid consistency as the temperature increases \xe2\x80\x93 the melting process. When the heat is removed, the cocoa butter crystals become rigid again and come closer together, allowing the chocolate to solidify.[70]\n\nThe temperature in which the crystals obtain enough energy to break apart from their rigid conformation would depend on the milk fat content in the chocolate and the shape of the fat molecules, as well as the form of the cocoa butterfat. Chocolate with a higher fat content will melt at a lower temperature.[71]\n\nMaking chocolate considered ""good"" is about forming as many type V crystals as possible. This provides the best appearance and texture and creates the most stable crystals, so the texture and appearance will not degrade over time. To accomplish this, the temperature is carefully manipulated during the crystallization.\n\npistoles and callets Chocolate cubes,and\n\nGenerally, the chocolate is first heated to 45 \xc2\xb0C (113 \xc2\xb0F) to melt all six forms of crystals.[67][69] Next, the chocolate is cooled to about 27 \xc2\xb0C (81 \xc2\xb0F), which will allow crystal types IV and V to form. At this temperature, the chocolate is agitated to create many small crystal ""seeds"" which will serve as nuclei to create small crystals in the chocolate. The chocolate is then heated to about 31 \xc2\xb0C (88 \xc2\xb0F) to eliminate any type IV crystals, leaving just type V. After this point, any excessive heating of the chocolate will destroy the temper and this process will have to be repeated. Other methods of chocolate tempering are used as well. The most common variant is introducing already tempered, solid ""seed"" chocolate. The temper of chocolate can be measured with a chocolate temper meter to ensure accuracy and consistency. A sample cup is filled with the chocolate and placed in the unit which then displays or prints the results.\n\nTwo classic ways of manually tempering chocolate are:\n\nWorking the molten chocolate on a heat-absorbing surface, such as a stone slab, until thickening indicates the presence of sufficient crystal ""seeds""; the chocolate is then gently warmed to working temperature.\n\nStirring solid chocolate into molten chocolate to ""inoculate"" the liquid chocolate with crystals (this method uses the already formed crystals of the solid chocolate to ""seed"" the molten chocolate).\n\nChocolate tempering machines (or temperers) with computer controls can be used for producing consistently tempered chocolate. In particular, continuous tempering machines are used in large volume applications. Various methods and apparatuses for continuous flow tempering have been described by Aasted, Sollich and Buhler, three manufacturers of commercial chocolate equipment, with a focus now on energy efficiency. In general, molten chocolate coming in at 40\xe2\x80\x9350 \xc2\xb0C is cooled in heat exchangers to crystallization temperates of about 26\xe2\x80\x9330 \xc2\xb0C, passed through a tempering column consisting of spinning plates to induce shear, then warmed slightly to re-melt undesirable crystal formations.[72][73]\n\nShaping\n\nChocolate is molded in different shapes for different uses:[74]\n\nChocolate bars (tablets) are rectangular blocks of chocolate meant to be broken down to cubes (or other predefined shapes), which can then be used for consumption, cooking and baking. The term is also used for combination bars, which are a type of candy bars\n\nChocolate chips are small pieces of chocolate, usually drop-like, which are meant for decoration and baking\n\nPistoles , callets and f\xc3\xa8ves are small, coin-like or bean-like pieces of chocolate meant for baking and patisserie applications (also see Pistole (coin) and F\xc3\xa8ve (trinket))\n\n, and are small, coin-like or bean-like pieces of chocolate meant for baking and patisserie applications (also see Pistole (coin) and F\xc3\xa8ve (trinket)) Chocolate blocks are large, cuboid chunks of chocolate meant for professional use and further processing\n\nOther, more specialized shapes for chocolate include sticks, curls and hollow semi-spheres\n\nStorage\n\nChocolate is very sensitive to temperature and humidity. Ideal storage temperatures are between 15 and 17 \xc2\xb0C (59 and 63 \xc2\xb0F), with a relative humidity of less than 50%. If refrigerated or frozen without containment, chocolate can absorb enough moisture to cause a whitish discoloration, the result of fat or sugar crystals rising to the surface. Various types of ""blooming"" effects can occur if chocolate is stored or served improperly.[75]\n\nChocolate bloom is caused by storage temperature fluctuating or exceeding 24 \xc2\xb0C (75 \xc2\xb0F), while sugar bloom is caused by temperature below 15 \xc2\xb0C (59 \xc2\xb0F) or excess humidity. To distinguish between different types of bloom, one can rub the surface of the chocolate lightly, and if the bloom disappears, it is fat bloom. Moving chocolate between temperature extremes, can result in an oily texture. Although visually unappealing, chocolate suffering from bloom is safe for consumption and taste unaffected.[76][77][78] Bloom can be reversed by retempering the chocolate or using it for any use that requires melting the chocolate.[79]\n\nChocolate is generally stored away from other foods, as it can absorb different aromas. Ideally, chocolates are packed or wrapped, and placed in proper storage with the correct humidity and temperature. Additionally, chocolate is frequently stored in a dark place or protected from light by wrapping paper. The glossy shine, snap, aroma, texture, and taste of the chocolate can show the quality and if it was stored well.[80]\n\nComposition\n\nNutrition\n\nA 100-gram serving of milk chocolate supplies 540 calories. It is 59% carbohydrates (52% as sugar and 3% as dietary fiber), 30% fat and 8% protein (table). Approximately 65% of the fat in milk chocolate is saturated, mainly palmitic acid and stearic acid, while the predominant unsaturated fat is oleic acid (table).\n\n100-grams of milk chocolate is an excellent source (over 19% of the Daily Value, DV) of riboflavin, vitamin B12 and the dietary minerals, manganese, phosphorus and zinc. Chocolate is a good source (10\xe2\x80\x9319% DV) of calcium, magnesium and iron.\n\nEffects on health\n\nChocolate may be a factor for heartburn in some people because one of its constituents, theobromine, may affect the esophageal sphincter muscle in a way that permits stomach acids to enter the esophagus.[81] Theobromine poisoning is an overdosage reaction to the bitter alkaloid, which happens more frequently in domestic animals than humans. However, daily intake of 50\xe2\x80\x93100 g cocoa (0.8\xe2\x80\x931.5 g theobromine) by humans has been associated with sweating, trembling and severe headache.[82] Chocolate contains alkaloids such as theobromine and phenethylamine, which have physiological effects in humans, but the presence of theobromine renders it toxic to some animals, including dogs and cats.[83]\n\nAccording to a 2005 study, the average lead concentration of cocoa beans is \xe2\x89\xa4 0.5 ng/g, which is one of the lowest reported values for a natural food.[84] However, during cultivation and production, chocolate may absorb lead from the environment (such as in atmospheric emissions of leaded gasoline, which is still being used in Nigeria).[84] Reports from 2014 indicate that ""chocolate might be a significant source"" of lead ingestion for children if consumption is high (with dark chocolate containing higher amounts),[85][86] and ""one 10 g cube of dark chocolate may contain as much as 20% of the daily lead oral limit.""[85]\n\nChocolate and cocoa contain moderate to high amounts of oxalate,[87][88] which may increase the risk of kidney stones.[89]\n\nA few studies have documented allergic reactions from chocolate in children.[81] Other research has shown that dark chocolate can aggravate acne in men who are prone to it.[90] Research has also shown that consuming dark chocolate does not substantially affect blood pressure.[40] Chocolate and cocoa are under preliminary research to determine if consumption affects the risk of certain cardiovascular diseases[91] or cognitive abilities.[92]\n\nOne tablespoonful (5 grams) of dry unsweetened cocoa powder has 12.1 mg of caffeine[93] and a 25-g single serving of dark chocolate has 22.4 mg of caffeine.[94] Although a single 7 oz. serving of coffee may contain 80\xe2\x80\x93175 mg,[95] studies have shown psychoactive effects in caffeine doses as low as 9 mg,[96] and a dose as low as 12.5 mg was shown to have effects on cognitive performance.[97]\n\nExcessive consumption of large quantities of any energy-rich food, such as chocolate, without a corresponding increase in activity to expend the associated calories, can cause weight gain and possibly lead to obesity.[81] Raw chocolate is high in cocoa butter, a fat which is removed during chocolate refining and then added back in varying proportions during the manufacturing process. Manufacturers may add other fats, sugars, and milk, all of which increase the caloric content of chocolate.[81]\n\nPhytochemicals\n\nIn comparison to most foods, cocoa contains more phenolic antioxidants.[98] Cocoa solids are a source of flavonoids[99] and alkaloids, such as theobromine, phenethylamine, and caffeine.[100]\n\nLabeling\n\nSome manufacturers provide the percentage of chocolate in a finished chocolate confection as a label quoting percentage of ""cocoa"" or ""cacao"". This refers to the combined percentage of both cocoa solids and cocoa butter in the bar, not just the percentage of cocoa solids.[101] The Belgian AMBAO certification mark indicates that no non-cocoa vegetable fats have been used in making the chocolate.[102][103] A long-standing dispute between Britain on the one hand and Belgium and France over British use of vegetable fats in chocolate ended in 2000 with the adoption of new standards which permitted the use of up to five percent vegetable fats in clearly labelled products.[104] This British style of chocolate has sometimes been pejoratively referred to as ""vegelate"".[104]\n\nChocolates that are organic[105] or fair trade certified[106] carry labels accordingly.\n\nIn the United States, some large chocolate manufacturers lobbied the federal government to permit confections containing cheaper hydrogenated vegetable oil in place of cocoa butter to be sold as ""chocolate"". In June 2007, in response to consumer concern about the proposal, the FDA reiterated ""Cacao fat, as one of the signature characteristics of the product, will remain a principal component of standardized chocolate.""[107]\n\nIndustry\n\nChocolate, prevalent throughout the world, is a steadily growing, US$50 billion-a-year worldwide business.[108] Europe accounts for 45% of the world\'s chocolate revenue,[109] and the US spent $20 billion in 2013.[110] Big Chocolate is the grouping of major international chocolate companies in Europe and the U.S. U.S. companies Mars and Hershey\'s alone generated $13 billion a year in chocolate sales and account for two-thirds of U.S. production in 2004.[111] Despite the expanding reach of the chocolate industry internationally, cocoa farmers and labourers in the Ivory Coast are unaware of the uses of the beans; the high cost of chocolate products in the Ivory Coast make it inaccessible to the majority of the population, who do not know what it tastes like.[112]\n\nManufacturers\n\nChocolate with various fillings\n\nChocolate manufacturers produce a range of products from chocolate bars to fudge. Large manufacturers of chocolate products include Cadbury (the world\'s largest confectionery manufacturer), Ferrero, Guylian, The Hershey Company, Lindt & Spr\xc3\xbcngli, Mars, Incorporated, Milka, Neuhaus and Suchard.\n\nGuylian is best known for its chocolate sea shells; Cadbury for its Dairy Milk and Creme Egg. The Hershey Company, the largest chocolate manufacturer in North America, produces the Hershey Bar and Hershey\'s Kisses.[113] Mars Incorporated, a large privately owned U.S. corporation, produces Mars Bar, Milky Way, M&M\'s, Twix, and Snickers. Lindt is known for its truffle balls and gold foil-wrapped Easter bunnies.\n\nFood conglomerates Nestl\xc3\xa9 SA and Kraft Foods both have chocolate brands. Nestl\xc3\xa9 acquired Rowntree\'s in 1988 and now markets chocolates under their brand, including Smarties (a chocolate candy) and Kit Kat (a chocolate bar); Kraft Foods through its 1990 acquisition of Jacobs Suchard, now owns Milka and Suchard. In February 2010, Kraft also acquired British-based Cadbury;[114] Fry\'s, Trebor Basset and the fair trade brand Green & Black\'s also belongs to the group.\n\nChild labor in cocoa harvesting\n\nThe widespread use of children in cocoa production is controversial, not only for the concerns about child labor and exploitation, but also because up to 12,000 of the 200,000 children working in C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire, the world\'s biggest producer of cocoa,[115] may be victims of trafficking or slavery.[116] Most attention on this subject has focused on West Africa, which collectively supplies 69 percent of the world\'s cocoa, and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire in particular, which supplies 35 percent of the world\'s cocoa. Thirty percent of children under age 15 in sub-Saharan Africa are child laborers, mostly in agricultural activities including cocoa farming.[118] Major chocolate producers, such as Nestl\xc3\xa9, buy cocoa at commodities exchanges where Ivorian cocoa is mixed with other cocoa.[119]\n\nIn 2009, Salvation Army International Development (SAID) UK stated that 12,000 children have been trafficked on cocoa farms in the Ivory Coast of Africa, where half of the world\'s chocolate is made.[120] SAID UK states that it is these child slaves who are likely to be working in ""harsh and abusive""[121] conditions for the production of chocolate,[120] and an increasing number of health-food[122] and anti-slavery[123] organisations are highlighting and campaigning against the use of trafficking in the chocolate industry.\n\nAs of 2017, approximately 2.1 million children in Ghana and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire were involved in farming cocoa, carrying heavy loads, clearing forests, and being exposed to pesticides.[5] According to Sona Ebai, the former secretary-general of the Alliance of Cocoa Producing Countries: ""I think child labor cannot be just the responsibility of industry to solve. I think it\'s the proverbial all-hands-on-deck: government, civil society, the private sector. And there, you need leadership.""[116] Reported in 2018, a 3-year pilot program \xe2\x80\x93 conducted by Nestl\xc3\xa9 with 26,000 farmers mostly located in C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire \xe2\x80\x93 observed a 51% decrease in the number of children doing hazardous jobs in cocoa farming.[4] The US Department of Labor formed the Child Labor Cocoa Coordinating Group as a public-private partnership with the governments of Ghana and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire to address child labor practices in the cocoa industry.[124] The International Cocoa Initiative involving major cocoa manufacturers established the Child Labor Monitoring and Remediation System intended to monitor thousands of farms in Ghana and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire for child labor conditions,[4][5] but the program reached less than 20% of the child laborers.[125] Despite these efforts, goals to reduce child labor in West Africa by 70% before 2020 are frustrated by persistent poverty, absence of schools, expansion of cocoa farmland, and increased demand for cocoa.[4][126]\n\nIn April 2018, the Cocoa Barometer report stated: ""Not a single company or government is anywhere near reaching the sector-wide objective of the elimination of child labor, and not even near their commitments of a 70% reduction of child labor by 2020"".[126]\n\nFair trade\n\nIn the 2000s, some chocolate producers began to engage in fair trade initiatives, to address concerns about the marginalization of cocoa laborers in developing countries. Traditionally, Africa and other developing countries received low prices for their exported commodities such as cocoa, which caused poverty to abound. Fairtrade seeks to establish a system of direct trade from developing countries to counteract this unfair system.[127] One solution for fair labor practices is for farmers to become part of an Agricultural cooperative. Cooperatives pay farmers a fair price for their cocoa so farmers have enough money for food, clothes, and school fees.[128] One of the main tenets of fair trade is that farmers receive a fair price, but this does not mean that the larger amount of money paid for fair trade cocoa goes directly to the farmers. The effectiveness of fair trade has been questioned. In a 2014 article, The Economist stated that workers on fair trade farms have a lower standard of living than on similar farms outside the fair trade system.[129]\n\nUsage and consumption\n\ns\'more topped with melted chocolate from a chocolate bar\n\nChocolate cake with chocolate frosting\n\nBars\n\nChocolate is sold in chocolate bars, which come in dark chocolate, milk chocolate and white chocolate varieties. Some bars that are mostly chocolate have other ingredients blended into the chocolate, such as nuts, raisins, or crisped rice. Chocolate is used as an ingredient in a huge variety of bars, which typically contain various confectionary ingredients (e.g., nougat, wafers, caramel, nuts, etc.) which are coated in chocolate.\n\nCoating and filling\n\nChocolate is used as a flavouring product in many desserts, such as chocolate cakes, chocolate brownies, chocolate mousse and chocolate chip cookies. Numerous types of candy and snacks contain chocolate, either as a filling (e.g., M&M\'s) or as a coating (e.g., chocolate-coated raisins or chocolate-coated peanuts).\n\nBeverages\n\nSome non-alcoholic beverages contain chocolate, such as chocolate milk, hot chocolate, chocolate milkshakes and tejate. Some alcoholic liqueurs are flavoured with chocolate, such as chocolate liqueur and creme de cacao. Chocolate is a popular flavour of ice cream and pudding, and chocolate sauce is a commonly added as a topping on ice cream sundaes. The caff\xc3\xa8 mocha is an espresso beverage containing chocolate.\n\nSee also\n\nReferences'";"Other";"501.txt-Other"

Its earliest use dates back to the Olmec civilization in Mesoamerica.\n\nThe next time you eat a piece of chocolate, you may not have to feel so guilty about it. Despite its bad reputation for causing weight gain, a number of health benefits may be associated with this delicious treat.\n\nShare on Pinterest Recent research suggests that chocolate may have some health benefits.\n\nChocolate receives a lot of bad press because of its high fat and sugar content. Its consumption has been associated with acne, obesity, high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, and diabetes.\n\nHowever, according to a review of chocolate\xe2\x80\x99s health effects published in the Netherlands Journal of Medicine, it\xe2\x80\x99s not all bad news.\n\nThe authors point to the discovery that cocoa, the key ingredient in chocolate, contains biologically active phenolic compounds.\n\nThis has changed people\xe2\x80\x99s views on chocolate, and it has stimulated research into how it might impact aging, and conditions such as oxidative stress, blood pressure regulation, and atherosclerosis.\n\nChocolate\xe2\x80\x99s antioxidant potential may have a range of health benefits. The higher the cocoa content, as in dark chocolate, the more benefits there are. Dark chocolate may also contain less fat and sugar, but it is important to check the label.\n\nEating chocolate may have the following benefits:\n\nlowering cholesterol levels\n\npreventing cognitive decline\n\nreducing the risk of cardiovascular problems\n\nIt is important to note that the possible health benefits mentioned below came from single studies. More research is needed to confirm that eating chocolate can really improve people\xe2\x80\x99s health.\n\nIn addition, chocolate bars do not contain only cocoa. The benefits and risks of any other ingredients, such as sugar and fat, need to be considered.\n\n1) Cholesterol\n\nOne study, published in The Journal of Nutrition, suggests that chocolate consumption might help reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, also known as \xe2\x80\x9cbad cholesterol.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe researchers set out to investigate whether chocolate bars containing plant sterols (PS) and cocoa flavanols (CF) have any effect on cholesterol levels.\n\nThe authors concluded: \xe2\x80\x9cRegular consumption of chocolate bars containing PS and CF, as part of a low-fat diet, may support cardiovascular health by lowering cholesterol and improving blood pressure.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n2) Cognitive function\n\nScientists at Harvard Medical School have suggested that drinking two cups of hot chocolate a day could help keep the brain healthy and reduce memory decline in older people.\n\nThe researchers found that hot chocolate helped improve blood flow to parts of the brain where it was needed.\n\nLead author, Farzaneh A. Sorond, said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs different areas of the brain need more energy to complete their tasks, they also need greater blood flow. This relationship, called neurovascular coupling, may play an important role in diseases such as Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nResults of a lab experiment, published in 2014, indicated that a cocoa extract, called lavado, might reduce or prevent damage to nerve pathways found in patients with Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s disease. This extract could help slow symptoms such as cognitive decline.\n\nAnother study, published in 2016 in the journal Appetite, suggests eating chocolate at least once weekly could improve cognitive function.\n\n3) Heart disease\n\nResearch published in The BMJ, suggests that consuming chocolate could help lower the risk of developing heart disease by one-third .\n\nBased on their observations, the authors concluded that higher levels of chocolate consumption could be linked to a lower risk of cardiometabolic disorders.\n\nThey call for further experimental studies to confirm whether consuming chocolate is beneficial.\n\n4) Stroke\n\nCanadian scientists, in a study involving 44,489 individuals, found that people who ate one serving of chocolate were 22 percent less likely to experience a stroke than those who did not. Also, those who had about two ounces of chocolate a week were 46 percent less likely to die from a stroke.\n\nA further study, published in the journal Heart in 2015, tracked the impact of diet on the long-term health of 25,000 men and women.\n\nThe findings suggested that eating up to 100 grams (g) of chocolate each day may be linked to a lower risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\n5) Fetal growth and development\n\nEating 30 g (about one ounce) of chocolate every day during pregnancy might benefit fetal growth and development, according to a study presented at the 2016 Pregnancy Meeting of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine in Atlanta, GA.\n\n6) Athletic performance\n\nShare on Pinterest Chocolate may help athletes cover more distance while using less oxygen.\n\nFindings published in The Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition suggest that a little dark chocolate might boost oxygen availability during fitness training.\n\nResearchers who studied cyclists doing time trials in the United Kingdom found that \xe2\x80\x9cAfter eating dark chocolate, the riders used less oxygen when cycling at a moderate pace and also covered more distance in a two-minute flat-out time trial.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe scientists believe that the success of dark chocolate in this case is that it contains flavonols known as epicatechins, which enhance the release of nitric oxide in the body.

"504.txt";"b'Chocolate is the most popular sweet treat in the world. People around the world (but mostly in Europe and the United States) consume more than 3 million tons of cocoa beans a year, according to the World Cocoa Foundation. And, not only does eating chocolate make you feel good, it may also be good for your heart and your brain.\n\nWhat is chocolate?\n\nChocolate is prepared from the fruit of the Theobroma cacao, a tropical tree whose name means ""food of the gods"" in Greek, according to ""Chocolate: Food of the Gods,"" an online exhibit by the Cornell University Library.\n\nTheobroma cacao trees are native to the Amazon and Orinoco river basins in South America. The trees are widely distributed from southeastern Mexico to the Amazon River. They thrive in hot, humid areas within about 20 degrees of the equator, according to Cornell. As the popularity of chocolate spread, growers established plantations in other regions, such as West Africa and South and Southeast Asia. Today, Ghana, C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire, Nigeria, Indonesia and Brazil account for 79 percent of the world\'s cacao production.\n\nCacao trees bear fruit that are about the same size and shape of a papaya, according to Patric Chocolate. These bumpy, lumpy berries, or pods, are full of up to 50 sour seeds, or beans, covered in white pulp.\n\nCacao seeds are harvested by hand because machines could injure the trees, according to Cornell. Workers remove the pods, which are orange when they are ripe, and open them with a machete. The seeds are placed in large fermentation trays that are stacked and covered in banana leaves, where they are left for two to seven days. Fermentation produces the chocolate flavor and aroma. It also destroys the seed\'s embryo, preventing unwanted germination, and causes the white pulp to fall away from the seeds.\n\nAfter fermenting, the beans dry out on sunny platforms. Workers turn them several times a day for three to five days to complete drying. The beans can dry faster in rotary driers but sun-dried beans taste the best, according to Cornell.\n\nNext, the beans are taken to the chocolate factory, where they are cleaned and debris is removed. The beans are roasted in large, rotating ovens. The roasting draws out flavor and removes the beans from their hulls. Roasted beans go into a winnowing machine, which cracks the beans and removes hulls. The remaining part of the bean is called the nib. Nibs become chocolate.\n\nThe nibs are ground down under a series of rollers. This process results in a thick paste called chocolate liquor. Chocolate liquor does not contain alcohol (however, chocolate liqueur does). It is the main source of unsweetened baking chocolate, according to Pam Williams, co-founder and past president of the Fine Chocolate Industry Association (FCIA) and founder and lead instructor of Ecole Cocolat Professional School of Chocolate Arts.\n\nAt this stage, the type of chocolate being produced is determined. According to the FCIA, ingredients separate fine chocolate from that of average quality. ""Fine chocolate,"" as designated by the FCIA, contains only cacao liquor, cacao butter (optional), sugar, lecithin, vanilla (optional) and possibly milk fats and solids. Additional flavors or ingredients like nuts can be added later.\n\n(Image credit: Dreamstime)\n\nTypes of chocolate\n\nFine chocolate falls into three categories: dark chocolate, milk chocolate and white chocolate, Williams said.\n\nDark chocolate has chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, lecithin, sugar and vanilla.\n\nMilk chocolate has all of the above plus milk fats and milk solids.\n\nWhite chocolate contains everything milk chocolate does except chocolate liquor.\n\nChocolatiers debate whether white chocolate is really chocolate. Until 2002, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration considered it a confectionary rather than chocolate because it does not contain chocolate liquor. The Hershey Food Corp. and the Chocolate Manufacturers Association petitioned the FDA, which added a standard of identity for white chocolate. Because the FDA refers to it as white chocolate, rather than confectionary, some experts, like Williams, accept white chocolate as chocolate.\n\nWithin the three categories, the FDA also acknowledges several grades, Williams said. They include unsweetened or brute, which can be up to 99 percent chocolate liquor; bittersweet; semisweet; and dark milk chocolate. The type of chocolate depends on what ingredients are present and the percentage of cocoa, in addition to where the beans are from and the way they are prepared.\n\nHealth benefits of chocolate\n\nGood heart food\n\nSeveral recent studies have examined the role that chocolate may have on heart health. Cacao beans are full of phytonutrients, which act as antioxidants and provide additional benefits. Furthermore, cacao beans are rich sources of iron, copper, magnesium, zinc and phosphorus, according to the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Dark chocolate contains two to three times more beneficial flavanols than milk chocolate because milk chocolate\'s cacao concentration is diluted with milk and possibly more sugar.\n\nWhile most studies have found some correlation between chocolate consumption and reduced risk of heart problems, the amount and type of chocolate needed requires further study. A 2017 meta-analysis of the effects of chocolate on coronary heart disease, stroke and diabetes published in the journal Nutrients concluded that the most benefit was associated with moderate chocolate intake. The authors found little benefit in heart disease or stroke reduction among people who consumed chocolate more than three times a week. Protective effects against diabetes emerged at two servings a week, but that benefit disappeared if people had more than six servings a week.\n\nOn the other hand, the findings of a large-scale study of more than 150,000 primarily male U.S. veterans who did not have coronary artery disease at the beginning of the study, suggest that eating an ounce of chocolate at least five times a week may help prevent the risk of coronary artery disease-related events like heart attack and heart failure.\n\nChocolate may also help prevent the development of atrial fibrillation, a type of irregular heartbeat that increases the risk of heart failure, stroke and more. A study, published in the journal Heart in 2017, found that adults who ate chocolate at least once a month had 10 to 20 percent lower rates of developing atrial fibrillation than those who never or rarely ate chocolate.\n\nGood brain food\n\nChocolate may be good for the brain. Some studies have focused on chocolate\'s ability to improve cognitive function. A study published in the Journal of Alzheimer\'s Disease in 2016 found that chocolate consumption might lower the risk of cognitive decline in older people. The study looked at nearly 400 Portuguese citizens over age 65 and saw that those who ate a moderate amount of chocolate \xe2\x80\x94 on average, one chocolate snack a week; the study did not differentiate between milk and dark chocolate \xe2\x80\x94 decreased their risk of cognitive decline by 40 percent over two years. Those who ate more chocolate, or those who had more caffeine, saw fewer cognitive benefits.\n\nGood mood food\n\nChocolate is often associated with positive effects on mood, but the reasons why it makes some people feel good are debatable. Chocolate contains substances that stimulate the brain in the same way cannabis does, such as anandamines, and substances that have similar effects as amphetamine, such as tyramine and phenylethylamine, according to the Dartmouth Undergraduate Journal of Science. However, these substances are in very low concentrations \xe2\x80\x94 too low to induce an antidepressant effect.\n\nChocolate may interact with neurotransmitter systems that contribute to appetite, reward and mood regulation, such as dopamine, serotonin and endorphins, according to the 2013 article in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology. However, the authors noted, the effects may have more to do with chocolate\'s taste and smell than its chemical effects.\n\nA 2010 study published in Archives of Internal Medicine found a link between depression and chocolate consumption. The results showed that people who scored high on a screening test for depression consumed more chocolate than those who weren\'t considered depressed. However, the study pointed out that there is only a link, and cannot explain why. Since the participants were not followed over time, the researchers don\'t know whether eating chocolate ameliorates or amplifies a sad mood. The possibilities are many \xe2\x80\x94 from using chocolate as a sort of natural Prozac to the idea that chocolate might have some role in driving depression.\n\nHealth risks of eating chocolate\n\nLike many foods, chocolate is healthiest when eaten in moderation. The sugars and fats that are added to chocolate make it high in calories, which may lead to weight gain. Furthermore, many of the protective effects that chocolate may offer might be mitigated by overconsumption.\n\nHistory of chocolate\n\nScientists debate how long humans have been using and consuming cacao beans. Chocolate\'s history goes back at least 2,000 years, while historians Sophie and Michael Coe, authors of ""The True History of Chocolate"" (Thames and Hudson, 2013), suggest that it might go back four millennia. The word chocolate can be traced back to the Aztec word ""xocoatl,"" the name for a bitter drink made from cacao beans. This was the way chocolate was consumed until the Spanish conquistadors came to Central America.\n\nIn several pre-Columbian Latin American societies, cacao beans were used as currency, according to Smithsonian magazine. Mayans and Aztecs believed the beans had mystical properties and used them during important rituals. When the Spanish arrived, sweetened chocolate came into existence. Legend has it that the Aztec king Montezuma gave conquistador Hern\xc3\xa1n Cort\xc3\xa9s a bitter chocolate drink, which he said was disgusting. But Cort\xc3\xa9s\' men added cane sugar and honey to it and took it back to Spain, where it quickly became popular.\n\nChocolate was a fashionable drink for rich Europeans throughout the 18th century. The Industrial Revolution allowed chocolate to be mass-produced and brought the treat to the masses. The popularity led to the development of cacao tree plantations.\n\nEnslaved people farmed most of the plantations. Initially, Spanish colonizers forced Mesoamericans to farm the cacao plantations, according to ""The Biography of Chocolate"" (Crabtree Publishing Co., 2005), by Adrianna Morganelli. When the indigenous peoples began to die in large numbers from diseases brought by Europeans, enslaved Africans were brought over to make up the labor shortage. In addition to sugarcane, indigo and other crops, enslaved Africans planted, maintained and harvested cacao trees throughout the Caribbean, Central and South America to feed the new European taste for chocolate.\n\nIn 1815, Dutch physicist Coenraad Van Houten experimented with removing varied amounts of the cocoa butter from chocolate liquor, according to Cornell University. This led to the creation of cocoa powder and soon solid chocolate.\n\nIn 1847, a Bristol, England, chocolate company, Fry\'s, created the first mass-produced chocolate bar when Joseph Fry added additional cocoa butter to Van Houten\'s chocolate, which turned it into a moldable paste, according to Bristol Museums. Milk chocolate was invented soon after with the help of Henri Nestl\xc3\xa9, who went on to found the major food company that bears his name. Major European chocolate brands Lindt and Cadbury also got their start in the 1800s; Rodolphe Lindt invented the conching machine, which gives chocolate a velvety texture.\n\nMass chocolate consumption hit the United States in the late 1800s when Milton S. Hershey began selling chocolate-coated caramels. He then developed his own formula for milk chocolate, purchased chocolate factory equipment and introduced mass-produced chocolate bars and other shapes, like Hershey\'s Kisses, in 1900.\n\nIn 1923, the Mars Co. developed the Milky Way bar by putting nougat inside a chocolate bar. That same year, former Hershey employee H.B. Reese introduced Reese\'s Peanut Butter Cups, which later became part of the Hershey brand.\n\nAs the years progressed, chocolate concoctions from both small and large producers became increasingly innovative. In September 2017, Swiss chocolate company Barry Callebaut introduced ruby chocolate. Ruby chocolate comes from isolating specific compounds in cocoa beans, according to Confectionary News. That, along with a modified processing technique, results in a rosy pink chocolate that has a sweet but sour berry taste and no traditional chocolate flavor, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. Other colored chocolates are made from dyed white chocolate.\n\nThreats to chocolate\n\nChocolate production is threatened by climate change. According to a 2016 report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the primary cacao-producing countries of C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire, Ghana, and Indonesia will experience a 2.1 degree Celsius (3.7 degrees Fahrenheit) increase in temperature by 2050. Rainfall will not rise along with the temperature, causing lowered humidity levels. As a result, viable land for cacao production will significantly shrink. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\'s Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability report, 89.5 percent of the 294 chocolate-producing locations studied would become less suitable by 2050.\n\nFarmers and scientists are working to develop strategies to maintain chocolate production. Some farmers are planting taller trees next to cacao trees to increase shade and decrease moisture loss, according to the NOAA. Cacao plantations may also move to higher elevations with cooler temperatures and greater rainfall.\n\nGenetic scientists are taking a different approach. A January 2018 press release from the Innovative Genomics Institute announced a project to develop disease-resistant cacao. Condensing cacao plantations because of climate change could increase the spread of disease. The project will use CRISPR DNA-editing technology to make a heartier cacao seed.\n\nEthics of chocolate production\n\nAccording to Slave Free Chocolate, 2.3 million children work in chocolate production in Ghana and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire, where they are vulnerable to trafficking, slavery and other violent labor practices. The International Labor Rights Forum reports that these children are often exposed to chemicals, work long hours and are denied education. According to Epicure and Culture, many children are sold into slavery and never see their families again. Others are kidnapped.\n\nThough the Harkin-Engel Protocol of 2001 was designed to stop child labor in the chocolate industry, according to the CNN Freedom Project, little has changed. The deadlines for action have been repeatedly pushed back.\n\nConsumers who want ethical chocolate should look for certifications designating Fair Trade, Rain Forest Alliance, UTZ, and Fair for Life, according to Slave Free Chocolate\xe2\x80\x99s guide to chocolate companies.\n\nChocolate production can also harm the environment. Farmers often clear forests to make room for cacao plantations. According to the World Wildlife Fund, about 70 percent of C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire\'s illegal deforestation is related to cacao farming. One danger of deforestation is soil erosion, which can make land less fertile for cacao plants, creating a vicious cycle, according to Confectionary News.\n\nAdditional resources'";"Other";"504.txt-Other"

The Maya considered chocolate to be the food of the gods, held the cacao tree to be sacred, and buried dignitaries with bowls of chocolate.\n\nFull Article\n\nchocolate , food product made from cocoa beans , consumed as candy and used to make beverages and to flavour or coat various confections and bakery products. Rich in carbohydrates , it is an excellent source of quick energy, and it also contains minute amounts of the stimulating alkaloids theobromine and caffeine .\n\nHistory of chocolate\n\nThe cacao tree was cultivated more than 3,000 years ago by the Maya, Toltec, and Aztec peoples, who prepared a beverage from its fruit, the cocoa bean (sometimes using it as a ceremonial drink) and also used the bean as a currency. The Maya considered chocolate to be the food of the gods, held the cacao tree to be sacred, and even buried dignitaries with bowls of the substance (along with other items deemed useful in the afterlife). In fact, the identification of the (Olmec-originated) word ka-ka-w (\xe2\x80\x9ccacao\xe2\x80\x9d) inscribed on those containers was key to deciphering the Maya\xe2\x80\x99s phonetic manner of writing.\n\nSpain was the earliest European country to incorporate chocolate into its cuisine, but exactly how that happened is vague. It is known that Christopher Columbus took cocoa beans to Spain after his fourth voyage in 1502, though little was made of it at that time. It has been commonly thought (though there appears to be no evidence) that in 1519 Montezuma II, the Aztec ruler of Mexico, served a bitter cocoa-bean drink to the Spanish conquistador Hern\xc3\xa1n Cort\xc3\xa9s, who subsequently introduced the drink to Spain. A strong possibility is that chocolate first arrived in Spain in 1544 with representatives of the Kekch\xc3\xad Mayan people of Guatemala, who came bearing gifts (including chocolate) to visit the court of Prince Philip. However, it was not until 1585 that the first recorded shipment of cocoa beans arrived in Spain from Veracruz, Mexico. Sweetened and flavoured with cinnamon and vanilla, chocolate was served as a hot beverage and became quite popular in the Spanish court. It was many years before chocolate had its introduction to France, England, and beyond.\n\nengraving of an Aztec with cocoa beans and chocolate beverage \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican with his chocolate pot and goblet,\xe2\x80\x9d an engraving of an Aztec with cocoa beans and chocolate beverage, from a French history of chocolate, tea, and coffee, 1685. From Traitez Nouveaux and curieux du caf\xc3\xa9 du th\xc3\xa9 et du chocolate, by Philippe Sylvestre Dufour, 1685\n\nIn 1657 a Frenchman opened a shop in London at which solid chocolate for making the beverage could be purchased at 10 to 15 shillings per pound. At that price only the wealthy could afford to drink it, and there appeared in London, Amsterdam, and other European capitals fashionable chocolate houses, some of which later developed into famous private clubs. In London many chocolate houses were used as political party meeting places as well as high-stakes gambling spots, notably Cocoa-Tree Chocolate-House (later the Cocoa-Tree Club), which opened in 1698, and White\xe2\x80\x99s, which was opened by Francis White in 1693 as White\xe2\x80\x99s Chocolate-House. About 1700 the English improved chocolate by the addition of milk. The reduction of the cost of the beverage was hampered in Great Britain by the imposition of high import duties on the raw cocoa bean, and it was not until the mid-19th century, when the duty was lowered to a uniform rate of one penny per pound, that chocolate became popular.\n\nMeanwhile, the making of chocolate spread overseas and grew in sophistication. Chocolate manufacture started in the American colonies in 1765 at Dorchester, Massachusetts, using beans brought in by New England sea captains from their voyages to the West Indies. James Baker financed the first mill, which was operated by an Irish immigrant, John Hanan. Waterpower was used for grinding the beans. In the Netherlands in 1828, C.J. van Houten patented a process for pressing much of the fat, or cocoa butter, from ground and roasted cocoa beans and thus obtaining cocoa powder. In 1847 the English firm of Fry and Sons combined cocoa butter with chocolate liquor and sugar to produce sweet (eating) chocolate\xe2\x80\x94the base of most chocolate confectionary\xe2\x80\x94and in 1876 Daniel Peter of Switzerland added dried milk to make milk chocolate.

"510.txt";"b'Share on Pinterest Screen Moment/Stocksy United Dark chocolate is loaded with nutrients that can positively affect your health. Made from the seed of the cacao tree, it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the best sources of antioxidants you can find. Studies show that dark chocolate can improve your health and lower the risk of heart disease. This article reviews 7 health benefits of dark chocolate or cocoa that are supported by science.\n\n1. Very nutritious If you buy quality dark chocolate with a high cocoa content, then it\xe2\x80\x99s quite nutritious. It contains a decent amount of soluble fiber and is loaded with minerals. A 100-gram bar of dark chocolate with 70\xe2\x80\x9385% cocoa contains (1): 11 grams of fiber\n\n67% of the DV for iron\n\n58% of the DV for magnesium\n\n89% of the DV for copper\n\n98% of the DV for manganese In addition, it has plenty of potassium, phosphorus, zinc, and selenium. Of course, 100 grams (3.5 ounces) is a fairly large amount and not something you should be consuming daily. These nutrients also come with 600 calories and moderate amounts of sugar. For this reason, dark chocolate is best consumed in moderation. The fatty acid profile of cocoa and dark chocolate is also good. The fats consist mostly of oleic acid (a heart-healthy fat also found in olive oil), stearic acid, and palmitic acid. The stearic acid has a neutral effect on body cholesterol. Palmitic acid can raise cholesterol levels, but it only makes up one-third of the total fat calories. Dark chocolate also contains stimulants like caffeine and theobromine, but it\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely to keep you awake at night, as the amount of caffeine is very small compared with coffee. Summary Quality dark chocolate is rich in fiber, iron, magnesium, copper, manganese, and a few other minerals.\n\n2. Powerful source of antioxidants ORAC stands for oxygen radical absorbance capacity. It\xe2\x80\x99s a measure of the antioxidant activity of foods. Basically, researchers set a bunch of free radicals (bad) against a sample of a food and see how well the antioxidants in the food can disarm the free radicals. The biological relevance of ORAC values is questioned, as it\xe2\x80\x99s measured in a test tube and may not have the same effect in the body. However, it\xe2\x80\x99s worth mentioning that raw, unprocessed cocoa beans are among the highest-scoring foods that have been tested. Dark chocolate is loaded with organic compounds that are biologically active and function as antioxidants. These include polyphenols, flavanols and catechins, among others. One study showed that cocoa and dark chocolate had more antioxidant activity, polyphenols, and flavanols than any other fruits tested, which included blueberries and acai berries (2). Summary Cocoa and dark chocolate have a wide variety of powerful antioxidants. In fact, they have way more than most other foods.\n\n3. May improve blood flow and lower blood pressure The flavanols in dark chocolate can stimulate the endothelium, the lining of arteries, to produce nitric oxide (NO) ( 3 ). One of the functions of NO is to send signals to the arteries to relax, which lowers the resistance to blood flow and therefore reduces blood pressure. Many controlled studies show that cocoa and dark chocolate can improve blood flow and lower blood pressure, though the effects are usually mild ( 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ). However, one study in people with high blood pressure showed no effect, so take this with a grain of salt ( 8 ). Given the great variation between studies on this subject, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that more research is needed ( 9 , 10). Summary The bioactive compounds in cocoa may improve blood flow in the arteries and cause a small but statistically significant decrease in blood pressure.\n\n4. Raises HDL and protects LDL from oxidation Consuming dark chocolate can improve several important risk factors for heart disease. In a controlled study, cocoa powder was found to significantly decrease oxidized LDL (bad) cholesterol in men. It also increased HDL and lowered total LDL for those with high cholesterol ( 11 ). Oxidized LDL means that the LDL cholesterol has reacted with free radicals. This makes the LDL particle itself reactive and capable of damaging other tissues, such as the lining of the arteries in your heart. It makes perfect sense that cocoa lowers oxidized LDL. It contains an abundance of powerful antioxidants that do make it into the bloodstream and protect lipoproteins against oxidative damage ( 12 , 13 , 14 ). The flavanols in dark chocolate can also reduce insulin resistance, which is another common risk factor for diseases like heart disease and diabetes ( 15 , 16 , 17 ). However, dark chocolate also contains sugar, which can have the opposite effect. Summary Dark chocolate improves several important risk factors for disease. It lowers the susceptibility of LDL to oxidative damage while increasing HDL and improving insulin sensitivity.\n\n5. May reduce heart disease risk The compounds in dark chocolate appear to be highly protective against the oxidation of LDL. In the long term, this should cause much less cholesterol to lodge in the arteries, resulting in a lower risk of heart disease. In fact, several long-term observational studies show a fairly drastic improvement. In a study of 470 older men, cocoa was found to reduce the risk of death from heart disease by 50% over 15 years ( 18 ). Another study revealed that eating chocolate two or more times per week lowered the risk of having calcified plaque in the arteries by 32%. Eating chocolate less frequently had no effect ( 19 ). Yet another study showed that eating dark chocolate more than five times per week lowered the risk of heart disease by 57% ( 20 ). A 2017 clinical trial found that subjects who consumed almonds with or without dark chocolate showed improved LDL cholesterol levels (21). Of course, these four studies are observational, so it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear exactly if it was the chocolate that reduced the risk. However, since the biological process is known (lower blood pressure and oxidized LDL), it\xe2\x80\x99s plausible that regularly eating dark chocolate may reduce the risk of heart disease. Summary Observational studies show a drastic reduction in heart disease risk among those who consume the most chocolate.\n\n6. May protect your skin from the sun The bioactive compounds in dark chocolate may also be great for your skin. The flavanols can protect against sun damage, improve blood flow to the skin, and increase skin density and hydration ( 22 ). The minimal erythemal dose (MED) is the minimum amount of UVB rays required to cause redness in the skin 24 hours after exposure. In one study of 30 people, the MED more than doubled after consuming dark chocolate high in flavanols for 12 weeks ( 23 ). If you\xe2\x80\x99re planning a beach vacation, consider enjoying some extra dark chocolate in the prior weeks and months. But check with your doctor or dermatologist before forgoing your normal skin care routine in favor of more dark chocolate. Summary Studies show that the flavanols from cocoa can improve blood flow to the skin and protect it from sun damage.\n\n7. Could improve brain function The good news isn\xe2\x80\x99t over yet. Dark chocolate may also improve the function of your brain. One study of healthy volunteers showed that eating high flavanol cocoa for 5 days improved blood flow to the brain ( 24 ). Cocoa may also significantly improve cognitive function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment. It may improve verbal fluency and several risk factors for disease, as well ( 25 ). Additionally, cocoa contains stimulant substances like caffeine and theobromine, which may be a key reason why it can improve brain function in the short term ( 26 ). Summary Cocoa or dark chocolate may improve brain function by increasing blood flow. It also contains stimulants like caffeine and theobromine.'";"Other";"510.txt-Other"
"517.txt";"b'When most of us hear the word chocolate, we picture a bar, a box of bonbons, or a bunny. The verb that comes to mind is probably ""eat,"" not ""drink,"" and the most apt adjective would seem to be ""sweet."" But for about 90 percent of chocolate\'s long history, it was strictly a beverage, and sugar didn\'t have anything to do with it.\n\n""I often call chocolate the best-known food that nobody knows anything about,"" said Alexandra Leaf, a self-described ""chocolate educator"" who runs a business called Chocolate Tours of New York City.\n\nThe terminology can be a little confusing, but most experts these days use the term ""cacao"" to refer to the plant or its beans before processing, while the term ""chocolate"" refers to anything made from the beans, she explained. ""Cocoa"" generally refers to chocolate in a powdered form, although it can also be a British form of ""cacao.""\n\nEtymologists trace the origin of the word ""chocolate"" to the Aztec word ""xocoatl,"" which referred to a bitter drink brewed from cacao beans. The Latin name for the cacao tree, Theobroma cacao, means ""food of the gods.""\n\nMany modern historians have estimated that chocolate has been around for about 2000 years, but recent research suggests that it may be even older.\n\nIn the book The True History of Chocolate, authors Sophie and Michael Coe make a case that the earliest linguistic evidence of chocolate consumption stretches back three or even four millennia, to pre-Columbian cultures of Mesoamerica such as the Olmec.\n\nLast November, anthropologists from the University of Pennsylvania announced the discovery of cacao residue on pottery excavated in Honduras that could date back as far as 1400 B.C.E. It appears that the sweet pulp of the cacao fruit, which surrounds the beans, was fermented into an alcoholic beverage of the time.\n\n""Who would have thought, looking at this, that you can eat it?"" said Richard Hetzler, executive chef of the caf\xc3\xa9 at the Smithsonian\'s National Museum of the American Indian, as he displayed a fresh cacao pod during a recent chocolate-making demonstration. ""You would have to be pretty hungry, and pretty creative!""\n\nIt\'s hard to pin down exactly when chocolate was born, but it\'s clear that it was cherished from the start. For several centuries in pre-modern Latin America, cacao beans were considered valuable enough to use as currency. One bean could be traded for a tamale, while 100 beans could purchase a good turkey hen, according to a 16th-century Aztec document.\n\nBoth the Mayans and Aztecs believed the cacao bean had magical, or even divine, properties, suitable for use in the most sacred rituals of birth, marriage and death. According to Chloe Doutre-Roussel\'s book The Chocolate Connoisseur, Aztec sacrifice victims who felt too melancholy to join in ritual dancing before their death were often given a gourd of chocolate (tinged with the blood of previous victims) to cheer them up. Sweetened chocolate didn\'t appear until Europeans discovered the Americas and sampled the native cuisine. Legend has it that the Aztec king Montezuma welcomed the Spanish explorer Hernando Cortes with a banquet that included drinking chocolate, having tragically mistaken him for a reincarnated deity instead of a conquering invader. Chocolate didn\'t suit the foreigners\' tastebuds at first \xe2\x80\x93one described it in his writings as ""a bitter drink for pigs"" \xe2\x80\x93 but once mixed with honey or cane sugar, it quickly became popular throughout Spain. By the 17th century, chocolate was a fashionable drink throughout Europe, believed to have nutritious, medicinal and even aphrodisiac properties (it\'s rumored that Casanova was especially fond of the stuff). But it remained largely a privilege of the rich until the invention of the steam engine made mass production possible in the late 1700s. In 1828, a Dutch chemist found a way to make powdered chocolate by removing about half the natural fat (cacao butter) from chocolate liquor, pulverizing what remained and treating the mixture with alkaline salts to cut the bitter taste. His product became known as ""Dutch cocoa,"" and it soon led to the creation of solid chocolate. The creation of the first modern chocolate bar is credited to Joseph Fry, who in 1847 discovered that he could make a moldable chocolate paste by adding melted cacao butter back into Dutch cocoa. By 1868, a little company called Cadbury was marketing boxes of chocolate candies in England. Milk chocolate hit the market a few years later, pioneered by another name that may ring a bell \xe2\x80\x93 Nestle. In America, chocolate was so valued during the Revolutionary War that it was included in soldiers\' rations and used in lieu of wages. While most of us probably wouldn\'t settle for a chocolate paycheck these days, statistics show that the humble cacao bean is still a powerful economic force. Chocolate manufacturing is a more than 4-billion-dollar industry in the United States, and the average American eats at least half a pound of the stuff per month. In the 20th century, the word ""chocolate"" expanded to include a range of affordable treats with more sugar and additives than actual cacao in them, often made from the hardiest but least flavorful of the bean varieties (forastero). But more recently, there\'s been a ""chocolate revolution,"" Leaf said, marked by an increasing interest in high-quality, handmade chocolates and sustainable, effective cacao farming and harvesting methods. Major corporations like Hershey\'s have expanded their artisanal chocolate lines by purchasing smaller producers known for premium chocolates, such as Scharffen Berger and Dagoba, while independent chocolatiers continue to flourish as well. ""I see more and more American artisans doing incredible things with chocolate,"" Leaf said. ""Although, I admit that I tend to look at the world through cocoa-tinted glasses.""'";"Other";"517.txt-Other"

"523.txt";"b'Is Chocolate Good for Your Heart?\n\nWhy a little, in moderation, may be beneficial\n\nChocolate has gotten a lot of media coverage in recent years because it\'s believed that it may help protect your cardiovascular system. The reasoning being that the cocoa bean is rich in a class of plant nutrients called flavonoids.\n\nFlavonoids help protect plants from environmental toxins and help repair damage. They can be found in a variety of foods, such as fruits and vegetables. When we eat foods rich in flavonoids, it appears that we also benefit from this ""antioxidant"" power.\n\nAntioxidants are believed to help the body\'s cells resist damage caused by free radicals that are formed by normal bodily processes, such as breathing, and from environmental contaminants, like cigarette smoke. If your body does not have enough antioxidants to combat the amount of oxidation that occurs, it can become damaged by free radicals. For example, an increase in oxidation can cause low-density lipoprotein (LDL), also known as ""bad"" cholesterol, to form plaque on the artery walls.\n\nFlavanols are the main type of flavonoid found in cocoa and chocolate. In addition to having antioxidant qualities, research shows that flavanols have other potential influences on vascular health, such as lowering blood pressure, improving blood flow to the brain and heart, and making blood platelets less sticky and able to clot.\n\nThese plant chemicals aren\xe2\x80\x99t only found in chocolate. In fact, a wide variety of foods and beverages are rich in flavonols. These include cranberries, apples, peanuts, onions, tea and red wine.\n\nAre all types of chocolate healthy?\n\nBefore you grab a chocolate candy bar or slice of chocolate cake, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand that not all forms of chocolate contain high levels of flavanols.\n\nCocoa naturally has a very strong, pungent taste, which comes from the flavanols. When cocoa is processed into your favorite chocolate products, it goes through several steps to reduce this taste. The more chocolate is processed (through things like fermentation, alkalizing, roasting, etc.), the more flavanols are lost.\n\nMost commercial chocolates are highly processed. Although it was once believed that dark chocolate contained the highest levels of flavanols, recent research indicates that, depending on how the dark chocolate was processed, this may not be true. The good news is that most major chocolate manufacturers are looking for ways to keep the flavanols in their processed chocolates. But for now, your best choices are likely dark chocolate over milk chocolate (especially milk chocolate that is loaded with other fats and sugars) and cocoa powder that has not undergone Dutch processing (cocoa that is treated with an alkali to neutralize its natural acidity).\n\nWhat about all of the fat in chocolate?\n\nYou may be surprised to learn that chocolate isn\xe2\x80\x99t as bad for you as once believed.\n\nThe fat in chocolate comes from cocoa butter and is made up of equal amounts of oleic acid (a heart-healthy monounsaturated fat also found in olive oil), stearic and palmitic acids. Stearic and palmitic acids are forms of saturated fat. You may know that saturated fats are linked to increases in LDL cholesterol and the risk of heart disease.\n\nBut, research shows that stearic acid appears to have a neutral effect on cholesterol, neither raising nor lowering it. Although palmitic acid does affect cholesterol levels, it only makes up one-third of the fat calories in chocolate. Still, this does not mean you can eat all the dark chocolate you\xe2\x80\x99d like.\n\nFirst, be careful about the type of dark chocolate you choose: chewy caramel-marshmallow-nut-covered dark chocolate is by no means a heart-healthy food option. Watch out for those extra ingredients that can add lots of extra fat and calories. Second, there is currently no established serving size of chocolate to help you reap the cardiovascular benefits it may offer, and more research is needed in this area. However, we do know that you no longer need to feel guilty if you enjoy a small piece of dark chocolate once in a while.\n\nSo, for now, enjoy moderate portions of chocolate (e.g., 1 ounce) a few times per week, and don\xe2\x80\x99t forget to eat other flavonoid-rich foods like apples, red wine, tea, onions and cranberries.'";"Other";"523.txt-Other"

"530.txt";"b""Originally consumed as a bitter drink, it was prized as both an aphrodisiac and an energy booster.\n\nMankind\xe2\x80\x99s love affair with chocolate stretches back more than five millennia. Produced from the seeds of tropical cacao trees native to the rainforests of Central and South America, chocolate was long considered the \xe2\x80\x9cfood of the gods,\xe2\x80\x9d and later, a delicacy for the elite. But for most of its history, it was actually consumed as a bitter beverage rather than the sweet, edible treat it has become worldwide.\n\nWhat Is the Birthplace of Chocolate?\n\nMayan cacao drink Ren Photo/Getty Images\n\nArchaeologists have discovered the earliest traces of cacao in pottery used by the ancient Mayo-Chinchipe culture 5,300 years ago in the upper Amazon region of Ecuador. Chocolate played an important political, spiritual and economic role in ancient Mesoamerican civilizations, which ground roasted cacao beans into a paste that they mixed with water, vanilla, chili peppers and other spices to brew a frothy chocolate drink.\n\nAncient Mesoamericans believed chocolate was an energy booster and aphrodisiac with mystical and medicinal qualities. The Mayans, who considered cacao a gift from the gods, used chocolate for sacred ceremonies and funeral offerings. Wealthy Mayans drank foaming chocolate drinks, while commoners consumed chocolate in a cold porridge-like dish.\n\nAs people of the Aztec empire spread across Mesoamerica in the 1400s, they too began to prize cacao. Since they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t grow it in the dry highlands of central Mexico, they traded with the Mayans for the beans, which they even used as currency. (In the 1500s, Aztecs could purchase a turkey hen or a hare for 100 beans.) By one account, the 16th-century Aztec ruler Moctezuma II drank 50 cups of chocolate a day out of a golden goblet to increase his libido.\n\nWATCH: Season 1 of The Food That Built America without signing in now.\n\nSpaniards Introduce Chocolate to Europe\xe2\x80\x99s Elite\n\nChocolate arrived in Europe during the 1500s, likely brought by both Spanish friars and conquistadors who had traveled to the Americas. Although the Spanish sweetened the bitter drink with cane sugar and cinnamon, one thing remained unchanged: Chocolate reigned as a delectable symbol of luxury, wealth and power\xe2\x80\x94an expensive import sipped by royal lips, and affordable only to Spanish elites.\n\nChocolate\xe2\x80\x99s popularity eventually spread to other European courts, where aristocrats consumed it as a magic elixir with health benefits. To slake their growing thirst for chocolate, European powers established colonial plantations in equatorial regions around the world to grow cacao and sugar. When diseases brought by Europeans depleted the native Mesoamerican labor pool, African slaves were imported to the Americas to work on the plantations and maintain chocolate production.\n\nChocolate remained an aristocratic nectar until the 1828 invention of the cocoa press revolutionized its production. Attributed in varying accounts to either Dutch chemist Coenraad Johannes van Houten or his father, Casparus, the cocoa press squeezed the fatty butter from roasted cacao beans, leaving behind a dry cake that could be pulverized into a fine powder that could be mixed with liquids and other ingredients, poured into molds and solidified into edible, easily digestible chocolate. The cocoa press ushered in the modern era of chocolate by enabling it to be used as a confectionary ingredient, and the resulting drop in production costs made chocolate much more affordable.\n\nREAD MORE: Why the Candy Bar Market Exploded After WWI\n\nChocolate Becomes a Treat for the Masses\n\n10 Gallery 10 Images\n\nIn 1847, British chocolate company J.S. Fry & Sons created the first edible chocolate bar from cocoa butter, cocoa powder and sugar. Rival chocolatier Cadbury\xe2\x80\x99s, credited with pioneering the Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day chocolate box and chocolate Easter egg, followed suit soon after and in 1854 earned a royal warrant as purveyors of chocolate to Queen Victoria.\n\nIt was in Switzerland that chocolate production took one of its greatest leaps forward. In the 1870s, Swiss chocolatier Daniel Peter utilized a powdered milk developed several years earlier by his neighbor Henri Nestl\xc3\xa9 to produce the first milk chocolate bar, and the pair eventually formed the Nestl\xc3\xa9 Company. Swiss chocolatier Rodolphe Lindt\xe2\x80\x99s 1879 invention of the conching machine\xe2\x80\x94which used large stone rollers to mix and aerate chocolate to give it a velvety texture and superior taste\xe2\x80\x94allowed for the mass production of smooth, creamy milk chocolate.\n\nIn the United States, Milton Hershey pioneered the assembly-line production of milk chocolate. After selling his caramel candy company for $1 million and producing his first milk chocolate bar in 1900, Hershey bought farmland near his birthplace in rural Pennsylvania and built an entire factory town devoted to chocolate. The grass-fed Holsteins on the surrounding dairy farms supplied the company\xe2\x80\x99s milk, and a company town in Cuba supplied its sugar.\n\nREAD MORE: How Hershey's Chocolate Helped Power Allied Troops in WWII\n\nChocolate bars soared in popularity during the Roaring Twenties.

Father-and-son duo Frank C. Mars and Forrest Mars Sr. collaborated on the idea for the Milky Way bar, which hit the market in 1923 with the chocolate for its coating supplied by Hershey\xe2\x80\x99s. The family-owned business would rival Hershey\xe2\x80\x99s, and Forrest Mars Sr. later partnered with the son of a Hershey\xe2\x80\x99s executive to begin production of M&M candies in 1941.\n\nH.B. Reese, who had worked as a dairy farmer and shipping foreman for Hershey\xe2\x80\x99s, launched his own candy company in 1923 and five years later introduced Reese\xe2\x80\x99s Peanut Butter Cups.

"558.txt";"b'Cocoa butter composition\n\nPrior to any refining, the fatty-acid composition of the CB used in this study was determined by gas-liquid chromatography. The CB used in this study is mainly composed of stearic acid (37.3%), palmitic acid (25.4%), and oleic acid (33.5%) (Supplementary Table 1), which closely matches typical literature values4. The phosphorus content of the unrefined CB is 88 \xc2\xb1 1 ppm, or 0.263 \xc2\xb1 0.004% equivalent phosphatides by weight (Supplementary Table 2), which is similar to the 0.34 \xc2\xb1 0.07% reported by Arruda and Dimick6. After refining, the phospholipids are completely removed from the CB. The FFA content of the unrefined CB is 1.65 \xc2\xb1 0.01% (as oleic acid) (Supplementary Table 3), which complies with the requirement of having <1.75% FFAs as oleic acid in Codex standards. This is reduced to 0.06% after neutralization and bleaching.\n\nCrystal structure and polymorphism\n\nPowder X-ray diffraction is the most unambiguous method for determining CB TAG polymorphism. In this study, CB samples were melted at 80 \xc2\xb0C for 30 min to clear the memory of crystallization and then crystallized statically at 23 \xc2\xb0C in an incubator for 1 day. Form IV displays wide-angle reflections corresponding to short spacings of 4.35, 4.15, 3.97, and 3.81 \xc3\x85, Form V has short spacings of 4.58, 3.98, 3.87, 3.75, and 3.67 \xc3\x85, while Form VI has short spacings of 4.59, 3.86, and 3.70 \xc3\x8510. Unrefined CB displays reflections corresponding to short spacings of 4.61, 3.88, and 3.71 \xc3\x85, which is characteristic of Form VI, matching literature values closely (Fig. 1; Supplementary Table 4)10. Additionally, the small-angle reflections corresponding to long spacings of 68.16 and 32.89 \xc3\x85 further suggest a Form VI polymorphism and a 3 L structure (polytype)11. CB TAGs in Forms V and VI stack as lamellae in the [001] direction with a dimension, which is proportional to three fatty-acid chain lengths, hence the nomenclature \xe2\x80\x9c3 L\xe2\x80\x9d. Other polymorphic forms stack as 2 L structures, the more common polytypic arrangement12.\n\nFig. 1: Powder X-ray diffraction patterns and differential scanning calorimetric traces (inset) of unrefined native CB, refined CB, and refined CB with added minor lipidic components. Samples included a unrefined native CB, b refined CB, c refined CB with added 0.1% (w/w) dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, and d refined CB with added 0.1% (w/w) dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine. Samples were crystallized statically at 23 \xc2\xb0C for 24 h. Full size image\n\nIn contrast, the refined CB sample displays a pattern that resembles a blend of Forms IV and V. Short spacings of 4.35 and 4.18 \xc3\x85 agree with literature values for Form IV, while 4.60, 3.99, 3.88, and 3.77 \xc3\x85 match those of Form V11. Furthermore, the long spacings include both 2 L (45.20 \xc3\x85) and 3 L (65.57 and 32.69 \xc3\x85) arrangements, indicative of the presence of Forms IV and V, respectively11. Thus, it appears that the removal of minor components in CB through refining drastically changes the crystal structure of CB.\n\nThe wide-angle region of powder XRD spectra of refined CB with minor components added back is generally characteristic of Form V, or a blend of Forms IV and V (Fig. 1c, d and Supplementary Fig. 1 (a\xe2\x80\x93f)). In the small-angle region, diffraction patterns suggest that the 3 L structure is present in all samples. Long spacings in the range 64\xe2\x80\x9368 \xc3\x85 correspond to the reflections of the (001) crystal plane. Higher-order reflections, up to ones corresponding to the (009) plane of this lamellar crystal, are also evident. However, there is also varying amounts of the 2 L structure present in the various samples, specifically Form IV, which imparts undesirable properties and stability to CB and chocolate, including a low melting point and excessive softness12. The DMPC, GMP, GMO, and FFA samples have little to no 2 L structure present, indicated by the lack of a (001) plane reflection corresponding to ~45 \xc3\x85. In contrast, DPPE and GMS CB samples display a strong 2 L reflection, suggesting a mixture of 2 L and 3 L structures.\n\nMelting point and enthalpy of fusion\n\nThe melting points and enthalpies of fusion determined by DSC were compared across the CB samples and are shown in Table 1. Example DSC curves are presented for each sample in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2. Wille and Lutton reported the melting temperatures for Forms I through VI as 17.3, 23.3. 25.5, 27.5, 33.9, and 36.3 \xc2\xb0C10, while Lovegren et al.13 reported lower melting temperatures for the same six polymorphs as 13, 20, 23, 25, 30, and 33.5 \xc2\xb0C. The melting point of the unrefined CB used in our study closely matches that of Form VI, as reported by Willie and Lutton10. However, once the CB is refined, the melting point drops to 28.8 \xc2\xb0C, indicative of Form IV. After adding specific minor components back into the refined CB, the melting temperature increases again. Phospholipid and MAG addition to refined CB yield samples with melting points in the range of 29.8\xe2\x80\x9332.2 \xc2\xb0C, suggesting that the CB crystals are in transition from Form IV to Form V, as reported by Wille and Lutton10. Finally, when FFAs are added to refined CB, the melting temperature increases back to about 34 \xc2\xb0C, which may indicate a mixture of Forms V and VI, as it is also similar to Form VI\xe2\x80\x99s melting point of 33.5 \xc2\xb0C13. These results are all in agreement with the XRD data.\n\nTable 1 Melting point and enthalpy of fusion of unrefined native CB, refined CB, and refined CB with added minor lipidic components. Full size table\n\nThe enthalpies of fusion follow a similar trend, with a higher enthalpy of fusion (143.9 J/g) for unrefined CB, which decreases significantly after refining (110.9 J/g). Again, the phospholipids and MAGs have a much smaller effect, if any, compared to the FFAs. With the FFA samples, the enthalpies of fusion are similar to that of the unrefined CB. Guthrie reported an enthalpy of 147 J/g for Form V CB, which decreased for less stable forms14.\n\nCrystallization kinetics\n\nThe crystallization kinetics of the CB samples were quantified using half-times derived from the Avrami model fitted to the SFC-temperature data, as shown in Fig. 2, with the calculated Avrami constants shown in Supplementary Table 515.\n\nFig. 2: Static crystallization growth curve of unrefined native CB, refined CB, and refined CB with added minor lipidic components crystallized at 23 \xc2\xb0C (symbols) and corresponding fits to the Avrami model (solid lines). The inset table indicates the half-times of crystallization derived form model fits. Refining CB accelerates its crystallization (a), as does 0.1% (w/w) phospholipid addition (b). Addition of 0.5% (w/w) saturated monoacylglycerols, glycerol monostearate, and glycerol monopalmitate, do not significantly affect crystallization kinetics, while addition of the unsaturated glycerol monooletate does (c). Free fatty-acid addition to refined CB at 0.5% (w/w) levels accelerates crystallization for stearic, palmitic, and oleic acids equally (d). Values represent means and standard errors of three replicates and values with the same superscript letter are not significantly different (P > 0.05). Full size image\n\nUnrefined CB has the longest half-time of crystallization at 281.9 min, which decreases to 202.3 min after refining. Statistically significant decreases (P < 0.05) in the half time of crystallization of unrefined CB are observed after addition of DMPC, DPPE, GMO, and all free fatty acids tested, including palmitic, stearic, and oleic acids. Chaiseri and Dimick reported that different phospholipids had different effects on crystallization rate, with certain phospholipids such as lysophosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol retarding nucleation, while others such as phosphatidylcholine promoting nucleation. They also highlighted that removing phospholipids through refining decreased the crystallization rate, indicating that phospholids may be necessary as initial crystallization seeds in CB1. This agrees with the data presented in this study, with the addition of phospholipids increasing crystallization rate. Arruda and Dimick reported a much higher relative concentration of phospholipids in seed crystals than in bulk CB, with the majority being phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine6. Thus, it appears that the added phospholipids may aid in the nucleation of CB TAGs.\n\nThe FFA and GMO CB samples have a slightly shorter half-time of crystallization relative to the refined CB sample, but the effects of palmitic and oleic acid are not statistically significant (P > 0.05). M\xc3\xbcller and Careglio focused their study specifically on FFAs, and reported slower crystal growth of unrefined CB with added stearic, palmitic, and oleic acids7. However, we do not observe this in our study. Chaiseri and Dimick reported that saturated free fatty acids increased the crystallization rate in the early stages of CB crystallization1.\n\nFew studies have been conducted on the effect of MAGs on CB crystallization. Chaiseri and Dimick suggested that their effects are small due to their low concentration in CB1. In our study, GMS and GMP, both saturated monoglycerides, do not significantly affect CB crystallization kinetics. Surprisingly, the unsaturated monoglyceride GMO enhances CB crystallization.\n\nPolarized light microscopy\n\nLight microscopy revealed subtle differences in the microstructure of the different CB samples (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 3). Although all images display feather-like spherulitic structures, the unrefined sample has smaller spherulites. DPPE addition, interestingly, leads to the formation of larger spherulites with a different texture than upon DMPC addition. The spherulites of the refined and DPPE samples display granular structures in the centre of the spherulites and feather-like crystallites in the periphery. The MAG samples all exhibit similar crystal morphologies, with both granular structures and small feather-like spherulites present. This is similar to the stearic and palmitic acid samples, though the FFA samples display a more granular structure. It appears that the MAG and FFA samples, excluding the oleic acid sample, revert the CB to the morphology of the unrefined sample. However, the oleic acid sample differs greatly from the rest, displaying large spherulites analogous to the refined CB sample.\n\nFig. 3: Polarized light microscopy images of unrefined native CB, refined CB, and refined CB with and without added minor lipidic components. Samples included a unrefined native CB, b refined CB, c refined CB with added 0.1% (w/w) dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, and d refined CB with added 0.1% (w/w) dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine. Samples were crystallized statically at 23 \xc2\xb0C for 24 h. Intensity and contrast were auto-levelled. Full size image\n\nAn aspect that became clear during the microscopy studies is that the spatial distribution of mass of CB is affected by the refining process and subsequent addition of minor lipidic components. One way to quantify this spatial distribution of mass is by determining the box-counting fractal dimension (D box ) of the images. A high fractal dimension is associated with a greater fill of the available embedding space with crystalline mass, as well as a higher order in the distribution of this crystalline mass. The box-counting fractal dimension provides a value that quantifies the level of space-filling, as well as self-similarity within a structure, which can be related to the nucleation process of CB. Supplementary Table 6 lists these values. The unrefined and stearic acid samples have the lowest average fractal dimension, with D box = 1.63 and 1.62, respectively. In contrast, the sample with the highest fractal dimension is the refined sample at D box = 1.75, followed by the phospholipid samples at ~1.72. Samples with a higher fractal dimension are expected to have originated from a higher nucleation rate, as this leads to more homogenous growth across an area. On the other hand, slower nucleation rates would result in more heterogeneous growth, leading to a lower fractal dimension for the resulting mass distribution 16.\n\nInterestingly, here we also discovered a statistically significant (r = 0.77, P < 0.01) inverse correlation between the melting temperature of the samples and their fractal dimension, as shown in Fig. 4. This may be related to the polymorphism of each sample and its corresponding nucleation process. For the unrefined sample, a high melting temperature of 36.4 \xc2\xb0C indicates the presence of the Form VI polymorph. The higher free energy of nucleation for this most stable polymorph results in low nucleation rates, leading to a more heterogeneous mass distribution and a lower fractal dimension. Conversely, the lower melting temperature of the refined sample suggests a mixture of Forms IV and V, which are metastable polymorphs. These polymorphic forms have greater rates of nucleation, resulting in a more homogeneous mass distribution and a higher fractal dimension16.\n\nFig. 4: Global relationship between the box-counting fractal dimension (D box ) of polarized light microscopy images of CB samples and their corresponding melting temperature (T m ). Fractal dimension values plotted represent the means of six images, while melting temperature values plotted represent the means of three replicates. Full size image\n\nMechanical properties\n\nThe hardness of both CB and chocolate samples containing some of the minor components was determined by 3-point bending, and the elastic bending modulus calculated. The elastic bending moduli (E B ) of unrefined CB, refined CB, and DMPC CB are 44.1 \xc2\xb1 3.4, 35.4 \xc2\xb1 4.4, and 39.0 \xc2\xb1 3.7 N/mm2, respectively. There is no statistically significant difference between these values (P > 0.05). The melting temperatures for these samples are the same as well, with the average being 34.3 \xc2\xb1 0.1 \xc2\xb0C.\n\nFor the chocolate samples, the addition of phospholipids to molten commercial chocolate (90% cocoa solids) allows the chocolate to maintain hardness without complex tempering procedures, such as crystallization at 5 \xc2\xb0C for 1 h and subsequent storage at 20 \xc2\xb0C for 4 days. Other trials with static crystallization at 23 and 26 \xc2\xb0C yield chocolates with undesirable mechanical and surface properties, suggesting that the use of phospholipids to promote proper tempering still requires some optimization of crystallization temperatures. DMPC and DPPE were added chocolate at 0.1% (w/w) levels, and their properties were compared to commercial chocolate both directly from the package and recrystallized under the same conditions as the doped samples (Table 2). The E B is similar between the commercial chocolate and the phospholipid-containing samples, but is significantly lower for the recrystallized commercial chocolate (P < 0.05). When the chocolate is melted and recrystallized without any additive addition, it becomes much softer. A greater E B indicates a stiffer chocolate, relating to the property of snap, which is desirable in chocolate. However, DSC analysis revealed that all the chocolate samples have similar melting temperatures, all indicative of Form V CB crystals. XRD patterns further confirm the presence of Form V CB crystals in all samples (Fig. 5). Thus, it appears that the polymorphism of CB in chocolate does not wholly determine its mechanical properties, and these mechanical properties may be attributed to the microstructure instead.\n\nTable 2 Elastic bending modulus (E B ), melting temperature, and whiteness index (WI) of commercial chocolate samples with added phospholipids. Full size table\n\nFig. 5: Powder X-ray diffraction patterns for commercial chocolate with added minor lipidic components. Chocolate samples were molten, blended with the minor components and crystallized at 5 \xc2\xb0C for 1 h, followed by 20 \xc2\xb0C for 4 days. The a commercial chocolate, b molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate, c molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added 0.1% (w/w) dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, and d molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added 0.1% (w/w) dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine, all display powder X-ray diffraction patterns characteristic of well-tempered \xce\xb2 2 , triclinic, Form V cocoa butter crystals. This crystal form displays a strong reflection corresponding to a short spacing of ~4.6 \xc3\x85 in the wide-angle diffraction region, and characteristic wide-angle reflections in the 2\xce\xb8 region 20\xe2\x80\x9325\xc2\xb0. In the small-angle diffraction region, only reflections from the 3 L (001) plane corresponding to ~62\xe2\x80\x9363-\xc3\x85 were observed. The absence of reflections from (001) plane of the 2 L polytype indicates the formation of the optimal polytypic form in the cocoa butter in all samples. Reflections at higher angles in the small-angle region correspond to higher-order reflections for these two crystal planes. Full size image\n\nProper chocolate tempering typically focuses on the melting behavior of the chocolate, in other words, the polymorphism of the chocolate\xe2\x80\x99s CB triacylglycerol crystals2,3. However, there is little consideration for the microstructure and mechanical properties when determining whether chocolate has been properly tempered or not. Here we show that addition of DMPC and DPPE helps achieve the desired hardness and fracture properties in chocolate, without directly impacting the polymorphism. This likely results from changes in the microstructure of the underlying CB fat crystal network, which arises from the phospholipids affecting the nucleation behavior of the CB.\n\nSurface reflectance\n\nProper tempering of chocolate results in a smooth surface with high surface gloss17. Bloom, for example, is often characterized by the appearance of a grayish white film on the surface of chocolate, attributed to the uncontrolled polymorphic transformation from Form V to Form VI18. This white appearance is due to the presence of large surface crystals, which scatter light impinging upon them19. This can be quantified using the Whiteness Index (WI), calculated from RGB surface color measurements17. A higher WI indicates a greater level of fat bloom on the surface of the chocolate, or may also indicate a rougher surface. The WI for each of the chocolate samples is shown in Table 2. The commercial chocolate and the DMPC chocolate sample have similar WI, suggesting a properly tempered chocolate for the DMPC sample. Moreover, a statistically significant difference is evident between the DMPC chocolate sample and the recrystallized commercial chocolate sample (P < 0.05), which was not tempered properly. The lower WI of the DMPC chocolate sample suggests that the addition of this phospholipid aided in the stability of the chocolate, resulting in less fat bloom and/or a smoother surface compared to the recrystallized commercial chocolate sample. The effect of DPPE addition to molten and recrystallized chocolate is not as clear since the WI is not statistically different from the commercial, DMPC or molten and recrystallized chocolates.\n\nChocolate microstructure by synchrotron-based micro-computed tomography (SR-\xc2\xb5CT)\n\nSynchrotron \xc2\xb5CT analysis revealed similarities between chocolate microstructure among all samples imaged at a <450 \xc2\xb5m length scale. CT voxel intensity is directly proportional to material density. The number of voxels with a given intensity is then representative of the number of volume fractions with a given density in the analyzed volume. The molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate sample (Lindt-R) displays the largest difference between samples, with a narrowing and shift of the histogram compared to the fresh commercial chocolate (Lindt-F), molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added DMPC, and molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added DPPE. This indicates a difference in material structure upon recrystallization. This is visually represented in volume renderings where the most notable difference is a reduction in the green intensity for Lindt-R, compared to the Lindt-F, DMPC, and DPPE samples, as seen in Fig. 6. Volume rendering movies of each sample can be seen in the corresponding links in Fig. 6.\n\nFig. 6: Volume renderings of reconstructed slices, plotted histograms, and correlation matrix of SR-\xc2\xb5CT data. Samples included a molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added 0.1% (w/w) dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC), Supplementary Movie 1; b molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added 0.1% (w/w) dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DPPE), Supplementary Movie 2; c fresh commercial chocolate (Lindt-F), Supplementary Movie 3; d molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate (Lindt-R), Supplementary Movie 4; e plotted histograms, and f correlation matrix. Full size image\n\nA comparison of the histograms shows qualitative differences in the overall density distributions, which make up the sample volumes in the images. A correlation matrix was generated by inputting the voxel count values for each binned 16-bit gray-value and generating a table of correlation coefficients between the four chocolates density distributions. The correlation matrices show a high positive correlation in the material\xe2\x80\x99s density distribution regardless of treatment; however, the least variance is observed between DMPC vs. Lindt-F and DPPE vs. Lindt-F. The highest correlation coefficient is found between DMPC and fresh Lindt, and DPPE vs. fresh Lindt samples, with a value of 0.9987. This suggests that the complex microstructure of Lindt chocolate with added DMPC and DPPE and crystallized isothermally, is more similar to that of tempered fresh Lindt chocolate than without these additives.\n\nOverall, we find that the presence of various minor components within CB results in major changes to its polymorphism, crystallization kinetics, and crystal morphology. By refining CB through neutralization and bleaching, the unrefined CB transitioned from Form VI to a blend of Forms IV and V, in addition to displaying faster crystal growth. Although adding MAGs and FFAs back into refined CB results in some small differences, phospholipid addition has the largest impact.\n\nAt 0.1% (w/w) levels, DMPC and DPPE both significantly increase the crystal growth rate of refined CB. However, the DPPE sample exhibits significant amounts of the 2 L polytype, while the DMPC sample only displays 3 L polytypism, which is the more stable and preferred nanostructure. When added to a commercial chocolate sample, DMPC and DPPE both template the Form V polymorph with optimal mechanical properties, surface gloss and microstructure. This may allow for the production of chocolate products without the need for laborious and complex tempering protocols.\n\nProper tempering is often judged by the resulting melting temperature, a function of the CB polymorphic form2. However, as we show in this study, the various chocolate samples were all in Form V as determined by DSC and XRD analysis, but display different mechanical properties. This suggests that there is more to tempering than achieving the Form V polymorph, and important qualities such as gloss and snap may be heavily dependent on surface and bulk microstructure. Thus, DMPC, DPPE, and possibly other saturated phospholipids can potentially be employed as effective additives for engineering the crystallization behavior, polymorphism, nanostructure, and microstructure in CB and chocolate products.'";"Other";"558.txt-Other"
"566.txt";"b'Is chocolate toxic to dogs?\n\nYes, chocolate is toxic to dogs. While rarely fatal, chocolate ingestion can result in significant illness. Chocolate is toxic because it contains a chemical called theobromine, as well as caffeine. Theobromine is the main toxin in chocolate and is very similar to caffeine. Both chemicals are used medicinally as a diuretic, heart stimulant, blood vessel dilator, and a smooth muscle relaxant. Dogs cannot metabolize theobromine and caffeine as well as people can. That is why dogs are more sensitive to the chemicals\xe2\x80\x99 effects.\n\nHow much chocolate is poisonous to a dog?\n\nThe amount of toxic theobromine varies with the type of chocolate. The darker and more bitter the chocolate, the more dangerous it is to dogs. Baking chocolate and gourmet dark chocolate are highly concentrated and contain 130-450 mg of theobromine per ounce. Common milk chocolate only contains about 44-58 mg/ounce. White chocolate rarely poses any threat of chocolate poisoning with only 0.25 mg of theobromine per ounce of chocolate. Even if the amount ingested is not a toxicity concern, dogs can still become ill from the fat and sugar in chocolate. These can cause pancreatitis in severe cases or in dogs that have more sensitive stomachs. To put this in perspective, a medium-sized dog weighing 50 pounds would only need to eat 1 ounce of baker\'s chocolate, or 9 ounces of milk chocolate, to potentially show signs of poisoning. For many dogs, ingesting small amounts of milk chocolate is not harmful.\n\nWhat are the clinical signs of chocolate poisoning?\n\nClinical signs depend on the amount and type of chocolate ingested. For many dogs, the most common clinical signs are vomiting, diarrhea, increased thirst, panting or restlessness, excessive urination, and racing heart rate. In severe cases, symptoms can include muscle tremors, seizures, and heart failure. Complications such as developing aspiration pneumonia from vomiting, can make the prognosis for chocolate poisoning worse. When in doubt, immediate treatment by your veterinarian is recommended if a poisonous amount of chocolate is ingested.\n\n""Clinical signs of chocolate poisoning can take hours to develop and last for days.""\n\nClinical signs of chocolate poisoning can take several hours to develop. Signs due to large exposures can last for days due to the long half-life of theobromine. This means that it remains in the bloodstream for a longer period. Theobromine may be re-absorbed from the bladder, so intravenous fluids and frequent walks to encourage urination may be necessary. It is important to seek medical attention by calling your veterinarian or Pet Poison Helpline as soon as you suspect that your dog has eaten chocolate.\n\nWhat should I do if my dog eats chocolate?\n\nContact your veterinarian or Pet Poison Helpline to see if a poisonous amount of chocolate was ingested. If a toxic amount is ingested, you should have your dog examined by a veterinarian immediately. The sooner treatment begins, the better your dog\'s prognosis.\n\nWhat is the treatment for chocolate poisoning?\n\nTreatment depends on the amount and type of chocolate eaten. If treated early, decontamination including inducing vomiting and administering activated charcoal to prevent absorption of theobromine into the body may be all that is necessary. Treatments of activated charcoal may be repeated to reduce the continued resorption and recirculation of theobromine.\n\nIt is very common to provide supportive treatments such as intravenous fluid therapy to help stabilize a dog and promote theobromine excretion. All dogs ingesting a toxic amount of chocolate should be closely monitored for any signs of agitation, vomiting, diarrhea, nervousness, irregular heart rhythm, and high blood pressure. Medication to treat restlessness and other signs may also be necessary\n\nI saw a treat made for dogs that contains chocolate. Isn\'t this dangerous?\n\nMany gourmet dog treats use carob as a chocolate substitute.\n\n""Carob looks similar to chocolate and the two are often confused.""\n\nCarob looks similar to chocolate and the two are often confused. Some specialty dog bakeries will use a small amount of milk chocolate in treats. Since the amount of theobromine is typically low, this may be safe for most dogs. However, most veterinarians recommend that you avoid giving your dog chocolate in any form.\n\nPet Poison Helpline, an animal poison control center based out of Minneapolis, MN is available 24/7 for pet owners and veterinary professionals that require assistance treating a potentially poisoned pet. The staff provides treatment advice for poisoning cases of all species, including dogs, cats, birds, small mammals, large animals and exotic species. As the most cost-effective option for animal poison control care, Pet Poison Helpline\xe2\x80\x99s fee of $65 per incident includes follow-up consultations for the duration of the poison case.

"58.txt";"b'Cocoa butter composition\n\nPrior to any refining, the fatty-acid composition of the CB used in this study was determined by gas-liquid chromatography. The CB used in this study is mainly composed of stearic acid (37.3%), palmitic acid (25.4%), and oleic acid (33.5%) (Supplementary Table 1), which closely matches typical literature values4. The phosphorus content of the unrefined CB is 88 \xc2\xb1 1 ppm, or 0.263 \xc2\xb1 0.004% equivalent phosphatides by weight (Supplementary Table 2), which is similar to the 0.34 \xc2\xb1 0.07% reported by Arruda and Dimick6. After refining, the phospholipids are completely removed from the CB. The FFA content of the unrefined CB is 1.65 \xc2\xb1 0.01% (as oleic acid) (Supplementary Table 3), which complies with the requirement of having <1.75% FFAs as oleic acid in Codex standards. This is reduced to 0.06% after neutralization and bleaching.\n\nCrystal structure and polymorphism\n\nPowder X-ray diffraction is the most unambiguous method for determining CB TAG polymorphism. In this study, CB samples were melted at 80 \xc2\xb0C for 30 min to clear the memory of crystallization and then crystallized statically at 23 \xc2\xb0C in an incubator for 1 day. Form IV displays wide-angle reflections corresponding to short spacings of 4.35, 4.15, 3.97, and 3.81 \xc3\x85, Form V has short spacings of 4.58, 3.98, 3.87, 3.75, and 3.67 \xc3\x85, while Form VI has short spacings of 4.59, 3.86, and 3.70 \xc3\x8510. Unrefined CB displays reflections corresponding to short spacings of 4.61, 3.88, and 3.71 \xc3\x85, which is characteristic of Form VI, matching literature values closely (Fig. 1; Supplementary Table 4)10. Additionally, the small-angle reflections corresponding to long spacings of 68.16 and 32.89 \xc3\x85 further suggest a Form VI polymorphism and a 3 L structure (polytype)11. CB TAGs in Forms V and VI stack as lamellae in the [001] direction with a dimension, which is proportional to three fatty-acid chain lengths, hence the nomenclature \xe2\x80\x9c3 L\xe2\x80\x9d. Other polymorphic forms stack as 2 L structures, the more common polytypic arrangement12.\n\nFig. 1: Powder X-ray diffraction patterns and differential scanning calorimetric traces (inset) of unrefined native CB, refined CB, and refined CB with added minor lipidic components. Samples included a unrefined native CB, b refined CB, c refined CB with added 0.1% (w/w) dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, and d refined CB with added 0.1% (w/w) dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine. Samples were crystallized statically at 23 \xc2\xb0C for 24 h. Full size image\n\nIn contrast, the refined CB sample displays a pattern that resembles a blend of Forms IV and V. Short spacings of 4.35 and 4.18 \xc3\x85 agree with literature values for Form IV, while 4.60, 3.99, 3.88, and 3.77 \xc3\x85 match those of Form V11. Furthermore, the long spacings include both 2 L (45.20 \xc3\x85) and 3 L (65.57 and 32.69 \xc3\x85) arrangements, indicative of the presence of Forms IV and V, respectively11. Thus, it appears that the removal of minor components in CB through refining drastically changes the crystal structure of CB.\n\nThe wide-angle region of powder XRD spectra of refined CB with minor components added back is generally characteristic of Form V, or a blend of Forms IV and V (Fig. 1c, d and Supplementary Fig. 1 (a\xe2\x80\x93f)). In the small-angle region, diffraction patterns suggest that the 3 L structure is present in all samples. Long spacings in the range 64\xe2\x80\x9368 \xc3\x85 correspond to the reflections of the (001) crystal plane. Higher-order reflections, up to ones corresponding to the (009) plane of this lamellar crystal, are also evident. However, there is also varying amounts of the 2 L structure present in the various samples, specifically Form IV, which imparts undesirable properties and stability to CB and chocolate, including a low melting point and excessive softness12. The DMPC, GMP, GMO, and FFA samples have little to no 2 L structure present, indicated by the lack of a (001) plane reflection corresponding to ~45 \xc3\x85. In contrast, DPPE and GMS CB samples display a strong 2 L reflection, suggesting a mixture of 2 L and 3 L structures.\n\nMelting point and enthalpy of fusion\n\nThe melting points and enthalpies of fusion determined by DSC were compared across the CB samples and are shown in Table 1. Example DSC curves are presented for each sample in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2. Wille and Lutton reported the melting temperatures for Forms I through VI as 17.3, 23.3. 25.5, 27.5, 33.9, and 36.3 \xc2\xb0C10, while Lovegren et al.13 reported lower melting temperatures for the same six polymorphs as 13, 20, 23, 25, 30, and 33.5 \xc2\xb0C. The melting point of the unrefined CB used in our study closely matches that of Form VI, as reported by Willie and Lutton10. However, once the CB is refined, the melting point drops to 28.8 \xc2\xb0C, indicative of Form IV. After adding specific minor components back into the refined CB, the melting temperature increases again. Phospholipid and MAG addition to refined CB yield samples with melting points in the range of 29.8\xe2\x80\x9332.2 \xc2\xb0C, suggesting that the CB crystals are in transition from Form IV to Form V, as reported by Wille and Lutton10. Finally, when FFAs are added to refined CB, the melting temperature increases back to about 34 \xc2\xb0C, which may indicate a mixture of Forms V and VI, as it is also similar to Form VI\xe2\x80\x99s melting point of 33.5 \xc2\xb0C13. These results are all in agreement with the XRD data.\n\nTable 1 Melting point and enthalpy of fusion of unrefined native CB, refined CB, and refined CB with added minor lipidic components. Full size table\n\nThe enthalpies of fusion follow a similar trend, with a higher enthalpy of fusion (143.9 J/g) for unrefined CB, which decreases significantly after refining (110.9 J/g). Again, the phospholipids and MAGs have a much smaller effect, if any, compared to the FFAs. With the FFA samples, the enthalpies of fusion are similar to that of the unrefined CB. Guthrie reported an enthalpy of 147 J/g for Form V CB, which decreased for less stable forms14.\n\nCrystallization kinetics\n\nThe crystallization kinetics of the CB samples were quantified using half-times derived from the Avrami model fitted to the SFC-temperature data, as shown in Fig. 2, with the calculated Avrami constants shown in Supplementary Table 515.\n\nFig. 2: Static crystallization growth curve of unrefined native CB, refined CB, and refined CB with added minor lipidic components crystallized at 23 \xc2\xb0C (symbols) and corresponding fits to the Avrami model (solid lines). The inset table indicates the half-times of crystallization derived form model fits. Refining CB accelerates its crystallization (a), as does 0.1% (w/w) phospholipid addition (b). Addition of 0.5% (w/w) saturated monoacylglycerols, glycerol monostearate, and glycerol monopalmitate, do not significantly affect crystallization kinetics, while addition of the unsaturated glycerol monooletate does (c). Free fatty-acid addition to refined CB at 0.5% (w/w) levels accelerates crystallization for stearic, palmitic, and oleic acids equally (d). Values represent means and standard errors of three replicates and values with the same superscript letter are not significantly different (P > 0.05). Full size image\n\nUnrefined CB has the longest half-time of crystallization at 281.9 min, which decreases to 202.3 min after refining. Statistically significant decreases (P < 0.05) in the half time of crystallization of unrefined CB are observed after addition of DMPC, DPPE, GMO, and all free fatty acids tested, including palmitic, stearic, and oleic acids. Chaiseri and Dimick reported that different phospholipids had different effects on crystallization rate, with certain phospholipids such as lysophosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol retarding nucleation, while others such as phosphatidylcholine promoting nucleation. They also highlighted that removing phospholipids through refining decreased the crystallization rate, indicating that phospholids may be necessary as initial crystallization seeds in CB1. This agrees with the data presented in this study, with the addition of phospholipids increasing crystallization rate. Arruda and Dimick reported a much higher relative concentration of phospholipids in seed crystals than in bulk CB, with the majority being phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine6. Thus, it appears that the added phospholipids may aid in the nucleation of CB TAGs.\n\nThe FFA and GMO CB samples have a slightly shorter half-time of crystallization relative to the refined CB sample, but the effects of palmitic and oleic acid are not statistically significant (P > 0.05). M\xc3\xbcller and Careglio focused their study specifically on FFAs, and reported slower crystal growth of unrefined CB with added stearic, palmitic, and oleic acids7. However, we do not observe this in our study. Chaiseri and Dimick reported that saturated free fatty acids increased the crystallization rate in the early stages of CB crystallization1.\n\nFew studies have been conducted on the effect of MAGs on CB crystallization. Chaiseri and Dimick suggested that their effects are small due to their low concentration in CB1. In our study, GMS and GMP, both saturated monoglycerides, do not significantly affect CB crystallization kinetics. Surprisingly, the unsaturated monoglyceride GMO enhances CB crystallization.\n\nPolarized light microscopy\n\nLight microscopy revealed subtle differences in the microstructure of the different CB samples (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 3). Although all images display feather-like spherulitic structures, the unrefined sample has smaller spherulites. DPPE addition, interestingly, leads to the formation of larger spherulites with a different texture than upon DMPC addition. The spherulites of the refined and DPPE samples display granular structures in the centre of the spherulites and feather-like crystallites in the periphery. The MAG samples all exhibit similar crystal morphologies, with both granular structures and small feather-like spherulites present. This is similar to the stearic and palmitic acid samples, though the FFA samples display a more granular structure. It appears that the MAG and FFA samples, excluding the oleic acid sample, revert the CB to the morphology of the unrefined sample. However, the oleic acid sample differs greatly from the rest, displaying large spherulites analogous to the refined CB sample.\n\nFig. 3: Polarized light microscopy images of unrefined native CB, refined CB, and refined CB with and without added minor lipidic components. Samples included a unrefined native CB, b refined CB, c refined CB with added 0.1% (w/w) dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, and d refined CB with added 0.1% (w/w) dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine. Samples were crystallized statically at 23 \xc2\xb0C for 24 h. Intensity and contrast were auto-levelled. Full size image\n\nAn aspect that became clear during the microscopy studies is that the spatial distribution of mass of CB is affected by the refining process and subsequent addition of minor lipidic components. One way to quantify this spatial distribution of mass is by determining the box-counting fractal dimension (D box ) of the images. A high fractal dimension is associated with a greater fill of the available embedding space with crystalline mass, as well as a higher order in the distribution of this crystalline mass. The box-counting fractal dimension provides a value that quantifies the level of space-filling, as well as self-similarity within a structure, which can be related to the nucleation process of CB. Supplementary Table 6 lists these values. The unrefined and stearic acid samples have the lowest average fractal dimension, with D box = 1.63 and 1.62, respectively. In contrast, the sample with the highest fractal dimension is the refined sample at D box = 1.75, followed by the phospholipid samples at ~1.72. Samples with a higher fractal dimension are expected to have originated from a higher nucleation rate, as this leads to more homogenous growth across an area. On the other hand, slower nucleation rates would result in more heterogeneous growth, leading to a lower fractal dimension for the resulting mass distribution 16.\n\nInterestingly, here we also discovered a statistically significant (r = 0.77, P < 0.01) inverse correlation between the melting temperature of the samples and their fractal dimension, as shown in Fig. 4. This may be related to the polymorphism of each sample and its corresponding nucleation process. For the unrefined sample, a high melting temperature of 36.4 \xc2\xb0C indicates the presence of the Form VI polymorph. The higher free energy of nucleation for this most stable polymorph results in low nucleation rates, leading to a more heterogeneous mass distribution and a lower fractal dimension. Conversely, the lower melting temperature of the refined sample suggests a mixture of Forms IV and V, which are metastable polymorphs. These polymorphic forms have greater rates of nucleation, resulting in a more homogeneous mass distribution and a higher fractal dimension16.\n\nFig. 4: Global relationship between the box-counting fractal dimension (D box ) of polarized light microscopy images of CB samples and their corresponding melting temperature (T m ). Fractal dimension values plotted represent the means of six images, while melting temperature values plotted represent the means of three replicates. Full size image\n\nMechanical properties\n\nThe hardness of both CB and chocolate samples containing some of the minor components was determined by 3-point bending, and the elastic bending modulus calculated. The elastic bending moduli (E B ) of unrefined CB, refined CB, and DMPC CB are 44.1 \xc2\xb1 3.4, 35.4 \xc2\xb1 4.4, and 39.0 \xc2\xb1 3.7 N/mm2, respectively. There is no statistically significant difference between these values (P > 0.05). The melting temperatures for these samples are the same as well, with the average being 34.3 \xc2\xb1 0.1 \xc2\xb0C.\n\nFor the chocolate samples, the addition of phospholipids to molten commercial chocolate (90% cocoa solids) allows the chocolate to maintain hardness without complex tempering procedures, such as crystallization at 5 \xc2\xb0C for 1 h and subsequent storage at 20 \xc2\xb0C for 4 days. Other trials with static crystallization at 23 and 26 \xc2\xb0C yield chocolates with undesirable mechanical and surface properties, suggesting that the use of phospholipids to promote proper tempering still requires some optimization of crystallization temperatures. DMPC and DPPE were added chocolate at 0.1% (w/w) levels, and their properties were compared to commercial chocolate both directly from the package and recrystallized under the same conditions as the doped samples (Table 2). The E B is similar between the commercial chocolate and the phospholipid-containing samples, but is significantly lower for the recrystallized commercial chocolate (P < 0.05). When the chocolate is melted and recrystallized without any additive addition, it becomes much softer. A greater E B indicates a stiffer chocolate, relating to the property of snap, which is desirable in chocolate. However, DSC analysis revealed that all the chocolate samples have similar melting temperatures, all indicative of Form V CB crystals. XRD patterns further confirm the presence of Form V CB crystals in all samples (Fig. 5). Thus, it appears that the polymorphism of CB in chocolate does not wholly determine its mechanical properties, and these mechanical properties may be attributed to the microstructure instead.\n\nTable 2 Elastic bending modulus (E B ), melting temperature, and whiteness index (WI) of commercial chocolate samples with added phospholipids. Full size table\n\nFig. 5: Powder X-ray diffraction patterns for commercial chocolate with added minor lipidic components. Chocolate samples were molten, blended with the minor components and crystallized at 5 \xc2\xb0C for 1 h, followed by 20 \xc2\xb0C for 4 days. The a commercial chocolate, b molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate, c molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added 0.1% (w/w) dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, and d molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added 0.1% (w/w) dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine, all display powder X-ray diffraction patterns characteristic of well-tempered \xce\xb2 2 , triclinic, Form V cocoa butter crystals. This crystal form displays a strong reflection corresponding to a short spacing of ~4.6 \xc3\x85 in the wide-angle diffraction region, and characteristic wide-angle reflections in the 2\xce\xb8 region 20\xe2\x80\x9325\xc2\xb0. In the small-angle diffraction region, only reflections from the 3 L (001) plane corresponding to ~62\xe2\x80\x9363-\xc3\x85 were observed. The absence of reflections from (001) plane of the 2 L polytype indicates the formation of the optimal polytypic form in the cocoa butter in all samples. Reflections at higher angles in the small-angle region correspond to higher-order reflections for these two crystal planes. Full size image\n\nProper chocolate tempering typically focuses on the melting behavior of the chocolate, in other words, the polymorphism of the chocolate\xe2\x80\x99s CB triacylglycerol crystals2,3. However, there is little consideration for the microstructure and mechanical properties when determining whether chocolate has been properly tempered or not. Here we show that addition of DMPC and DPPE helps achieve the desired hardness and fracture properties in chocolate, without directly impacting the polymorphism. This likely results from changes in the microstructure of the underlying CB fat crystal network, which arises from the phospholipids affecting the nucleation behavior of the CB.\n\nSurface reflectance\n\nProper tempering of chocolate results in a smooth surface with high surface gloss17. Bloom, for example, is often characterized by the appearance of a grayish white film on the surface of chocolate, attributed to the uncontrolled polymorphic transformation from Form V to Form VI18. This white appearance is due to the presence of large surface crystals, which scatter light impinging upon them19. This can be quantified using the Whiteness Index (WI), calculated from RGB surface color measurements17. A higher WI indicates a greater level of fat bloom on the surface of the chocolate, or may also indicate a rougher surface. The WI for each of the chocolate samples is shown in Table 2. The commercial chocolate and the DMPC chocolate sample have similar WI, suggesting a properly tempered chocolate for the DMPC sample. Moreover, a statistically significant difference is evident between the DMPC chocolate sample and the recrystallized commercial chocolate sample (P < 0.05), which was not tempered properly. The lower WI of the DMPC chocolate sample suggests that the addition of this phospholipid aided in the stability of the chocolate, resulting in less fat bloom and/or a smoother surface compared to the recrystallized commercial chocolate sample. The effect of DPPE addition to molten and recrystallized chocolate is not as clear since the WI is not statistically different from the commercial, DMPC or molten and recrystallized chocolates.\n\nChocolate microstructure by synchrotron-based micro-computed tomography (SR-\xc2\xb5CT)\n\nSynchrotron \xc2\xb5CT analysis revealed similarities between chocolate microstructure among all samples imaged at a <450 \xc2\xb5m length scale. CT voxel intensity is directly proportional to material density. The number of voxels with a given intensity is then representative of the number of volume fractions with a given density in the analyzed volume. The molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate sample (Lindt-R) displays the largest difference between samples, with a narrowing and shift of the histogram compared to the fresh commercial chocolate (Lindt-F), molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added DMPC, and molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added DPPE. This indicates a difference in material structure upon recrystallization. This is visually represented in volume renderings where the most notable difference is a reduction in the green intensity for Lindt-R, compared to the Lindt-F, DMPC, and DPPE samples, as seen in Fig. 6. Volume rendering movies of each sample can be seen in the corresponding links in Fig. 6.\n\nFig. 6: Volume renderings of reconstructed slices, plotted histograms, and correlation matrix of SR-\xc2\xb5CT data. Samples included a molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added 0.1% (w/w) dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC), Supplementary Movie 1; b molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added 0.1% (w/w) dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DPPE), Supplementary Movie 2; c fresh commercial chocolate (Lindt-F), Supplementary Movie 3; d molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate (Lindt-R), Supplementary Movie 4; e plotted histograms, and f correlation matrix. Full size image\n\nA comparison of the histograms shows qualitative differences in the overall density distributions, which make up the sample volumes in the images. A correlation matrix was generated by inputting the voxel count values for each binned 16-bit gray-value and generating a table of correlation coefficients between the four chocolates density distributions. The correlation matrices show a high positive correlation in the material\xe2\x80\x99s density distribution regardless of treatment; however, the least variance is observed between DMPC vs. Lindt-F and DPPE vs. Lindt-F. The highest correlation coefficient is found between DMPC and fresh Lindt, and DPPE vs. fresh Lindt samples, with a value of 0.9987. This suggests that the complex microstructure of Lindt chocolate with added DMPC and DPPE and crystallized isothermally, is more similar to that of tempered fresh Lindt chocolate than without these additives.\n\nOverall, we find that the presence of various minor components within CB results in major changes to its polymorphism, crystallization kinetics, and crystal morphology. By refining CB through neutralization and bleaching, the unrefined CB transitioned from Form VI to a blend of Forms IV and V, in addition to displaying faster crystal growth. Although adding MAGs and FFAs back into refined CB results in some small differences, phospholipid addition has the largest impact.\n\nAt 0.1% (w/w) levels, DMPC and DPPE both significantly increase the crystal growth rate of refined CB. However, the DPPE sample exhibits significant amounts of the 2 L polytype, while the DMPC sample only displays 3 L polytypism, which is the more stable and preferred nanostructure. When added to a commercial chocolate sample, DMPC and DPPE both template the Form V polymorph with optimal mechanical properties, surface gloss and microstructure. This may allow for the production of chocolate products without the need for laborious and complex tempering protocols.\n\nProper tempering is often judged by the resulting melting temperature, a function of the CB polymorphic form2. However, as we show in this study, the various chocolate samples were all in Form V as determined by DSC and XRD analysis, but display different mechanical properties. This suggests that there is more to tempering than achieving the Form V polymorph, and important qualities such as gloss and snap may be heavily dependent on surface and bulk microstructure. Thus, DMPC, DPPE, and possibly other saturated phospholipids can potentially be employed as effective additives for engineering the crystallization behavior, polymorphism, nanostructure, and microstructure in CB and chocolate products.'";"Other";"58.txt-Other"
"589.txt";"b'Chocolate is toxic to dogs, and depending on the type and amount of chocolate consumed and the weight of your dog, it could cause a serious medical emergency. If you know your dog has eaten chocolate, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to monitor him for signs of toxicity (see below), and it\xe2\x80\x99s recommended that you contact your veterinarian or the Pet Poison Helpline (855-213-6680, fee applies) for advice.\n\nLearn how much is too much, which types of chocolate are the most dangerous, and what signs to look for that may signal your dog needs treatment.\n\nWhy Chocolate Is Toxic to Dogs\n\nChocolate contains both theobromine and caffeine, both of which can speed the heart rate and stimulate the nervous system of dogs, the Merck/Merial Manual for Veterinary Health explains. The risk of your dog becoming sick from ingesting chocolate depends on the type and amount of chocolate consumed and the weight of the dog (calculate your dog\xe2\x80\x99s risk of toxicity with this easy-to-use program). The concentrations of these toxic substances vary among different types of chocolates. Here are a few types of chocolate listed in order of theobromine content:\n\nCocoa powder (most toxic) Unsweetened baker\xe2\x80\x99s chocolate Semisweet chocolate Dark chocolate Milk chocolate\n\nKnowing how much and what kind of chocolate your dog ate can help you and your vet determine if you have an emergency. In general, mild symptoms of chocolate toxicity occur when a dog consumes 20 mg of methylxanthines per kilogram of body weight. Cardiac symptoms of chocolate toxicity occur around 40 to 50 mg/kg, and seizures occur at dosages greater than 60 mg/kg.\n\nIn simpler terms, that means a very concerning dose of chocolate is approximately one ounce of milk chocolate per pound of body weight. Since an average Hershey\xe2\x80\x99s Milk Chocolate bar is 1.55 ounces, consuming even one chocolate bar can have serious consequences, especially for small dogs. Eating a crumb of chocolate cake or a very small piece of a chocolate bar, on the other hand, probably won\xe2\x80\x99t kill your dog, especially if it is a larger breed, but chocolate should never be fed as a treat.\n\nWhat are the Signs of Chocolate Poisoning?\n\nSigns of chocolate poisoning usually appear within 6 to 12 hours after your dog has eaten it, may last up to 72 hours, and include the following:\n\nVomiting\n\nDiarrhea\n\nRestlessness\n\nIncreased urination\n\nTremors\n\nElevated or abnormal heart rate\n\nSeizures\n\nCollapse and death\n\nNote: Older dogs and dogs with heart conditions are more at risk of sudden death from chocolate poisoning.\n\nWhat to Do If Your Dog Ate Chocolate\n\nIf you believe your dog ate chocolate, call your veterinarian immediately or call the Pet Poison Helpline (855-213-6680) for advice. Based on your dog\xe2\x80\x99s size and the amount and type of chocolate consumed, your veterinarian may recommend that you monitor your dog for the clinical signs listed above and call back if his condition worsens.\n\nIn other cases, the veterinarian may prefer you bring the dog into the clinic. If your pet consumed the chocolate less than two hours ago, your veterinarian may induce vomiting and give him several doses of activated charcoal, which works to move the toxins out of the body without being absorbed into the bloodstream. For more severe cases, veterinary intervention may be needed to provide supplemental treatment, such as medications or IV fluids, to resolve the effects of the poisoning. Dogs suffering from seizures may need to be monitored at the clinic overnight.\n\nHow to Prevent Your Dog from Eating Chocolate\n\nEven though small amounts of milk chocolate may not cause a problem in larger dogs, it\xe2\x80\x99s still not recommended that pet owners offer their dog chocolate as a treat. To prevent your dog from sneaking chocolate, follow these tips:\n\nPut it away: Make sure all chocolate items, including cocoa powder and hot chocolate mix, are stored where the dog cannot reach them, such as on a high shelf in a closed-door pantry. Remind your children and guests that chocolate should be kept out of the dog\xe2\x80\x99s reach and not left on countertops, tables, or in purses. Keep this in mind during the holidays, too, making sure to place trick-or-treat bags, Easter baskets, Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day candy, Christmas stockings, and Hanukkah coins (gelt), for example, in a place where a dog cannot get to them.\n\nTeach \xe2\x80\x9cleave it\xe2\x80\x9d: The command \xe2\x80\x9cleave it\xe2\x80\x9d is extremely effective in preventing dogs from eating something that falls onto the ground or is left within reach during a walk. It\xe2\x80\x99s also a very easy command to teach.\n\nCrate train your dog: The safest way to ensure your dog doesn\xe2\x80\x99t eat anything harmful while you\xe2\x80\x99re not supervising him is to crate train him. Find a sturdy crate that is large enough for your dog to stand up and turn around and make it a comfortable, safe place for him to retreat to when he wants to be alone or when you can\xe2\x80\x99t watch him. Offer toys, a stuffed Kong, a favorite blanket, and treats to help him feel like the crate is his personal den.

"593.txt";"b""Many home chefs know that tempering chocolate to achieve a perfect finish and a satisfying 'snap' is no easy feat. Small variations in the quality of ingredients, temperature, mixing and timing can all set you up to fail, even when you learn from the best.\n\nThe results of a new study by food scientists from the University of Guelph in Canada suggest the addition of two common, naturally occurring fats \xe2\x80\x93 in the right proportions \xe2\x80\x93 might make chocolate tempering less of a gamble.\n\nPick up just about any block of milk chocolate from your local store, and you'll find it's more or less made out of the same things \xe2\x80\x93 cocoa butter for the form, cocoa mass (or chocolate liquor) for that familiar bitter taste, and additives like sugar or vanilla for sweetness and flavor.\n\nCrafting a solid bar of chocolate is a matter of encouraging the right size and distribution of crystals. In chocolate, crystalline forms of cocoa butter triglycerides (TAGs) are what give the food its characteristic shine, smooth texture, brittleness, and melting point.\n\nNot just any crystalline structure will do, either. Of the six distinct configurations of this class of molecule known to exist, Form V is the one that gives us a perfect temper.\n\nTempering \xe2\x80\x93 transforming the diverse mix of molecules into something that resists your bite while feeling heavenly smooth on your tongue \xe2\x80\x93 is a culinary process that has been gradually perfected over time, relying on a fine-tuned sequence of heating, mixing, and cooling.\n\nWhile researchers have investigated the influence TAG composition has on the success of tempering, little is known about how minor components of cocoa butter might make or break the process, including things like free fatty acids and phospholipids.\n\nGiven they make up just a few percent of the chemicals in cocoa butter, differences in their origins and refining might significantly alter the make-up of this key ingredient, either by helping the right crystals generate or interfering with their growth.\n\nPrevious research hinted at roles certain minor components had in the formation of the 'seed' crystals. For example, having a lot of free fatty acids seems to poison the crystallization process. Phospholipids, on the other hand, appeared to help them grow.\n\nTo nail down the precise proportions and chemical nature of these components, the researchers analyzed the exact make-up of a sample of cocoa butter, varying its composition by adding ingredients or bleaching out existing ones.\n\nThey then subjected it to a variety of tests to determine how variations in fat content might affect the growth time and proportion of crystal types, as well as things like melting point, surface reflection, micro-structure, and flex.\n\nWhile the amount of molecules such as free fatty acids had some effect, the real game-changer was the proportion of phospholipids, specifically saturated phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. Don't let the tongue-twister names fool you, though: these are garden variety biological molecules found in the membranes of living cells.\n\nBoth of these molecules in higher concentrations saw to the formation of Form V crystals, giving the cocoa butter the optimal glass, micro-structure, and mechanical properties.\n\nAdding the right amount of each to chocolate just might take the anxiety out of the tempering process, either by simplifying it or even eliminating it altogether.\n\nThis won't necessarily turn all of us into home kitchen dessertiers. But for professionals relying on recipes they can count on, knowing a little more about the chemistry of their chocolate creations just might give them the formula they need.\n\nThis research was published in Nature Communications.""";"Other";"593.txt-Other"

I had been wanting something sweet and since it was so hot outside, I decided I wanted ice cream. At the store, I saw the talenti pints of gelato and thought, ""how cute, I can reuse these."" I chose the coffee chocolate chip and I\'m so glad I did. It is creamy, has a full coffee flavor, and the chips are so thin and small they just melt away. I normally dislike chips in my frozen treats, but like I said, these just melted away nicely. My husband chose a the Belgian chocolate flavor and we were both disappointed with it compared to the coffee one. I ended up having to share mine with him which was fine since it is so rich I could only eat a little at a time.\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by DoctorEsq from Outstanding I have never been a coffee lover. Yes, in today\'s coffee addicted world that\'s strange but there you have it. I am, however, a tried and true Chocoholic. Yet the way Talenti has blended traditional coffee flavor with chocolate chips is truly outstanding. And the texture is perfect ~ a bit more solid then the other chocolate chip flavors especially in contrast to the Mediterranean Mint, Chocolate Chip, Peppermint Bark, etc ~ although all yummy, they melt far to quickly for my taste as I enjoy savoring the experience!! True, I pretty much love just about all the Talenti flavors and eat 1/2 a pint every night for my treat. But Talenti\'s Coffee Chocolate Chip has become one of my favorite flavors!\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by Auditory from This is what coffee flavor is all about In the mid-1960s when I was just a tot, my Sisters used to take me to a little shack that doubled as an ice cream parlor. The place featured a big name ice cream brand that is still one of the major players today. That\'s where I had my first taste of a coffee flavored frozen confection. Regrettably, the band name product today tastes nothing like I remembered it to have been. Fortunately, Talenti gelato has made that memory come back to life. With every spoonful, there is no guessing where the flavor is. Talenti has crafted a frozen dessert with an uncompromisingly strong coffee flavor that punches the tastebuds every time.\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by Kath12 from Delicious! My favorite ice cream flavor since I was young was Mocha. That flavor has disappeared. One night my daughter brought over brownies with a complimentary Talenti flavor. I fell in love with this gelato. Next time I went shopping I decided to buy the coffee with the chocolate chips. The first spoonful brought back the flavor I had longer for. It is now my nightly treat. All I need is 2-3 tablespoons full and I am totally satisfied until the next night. Sometimes I will mix it with one of your vanilla flavors & it is so yummy! No longer am I searching for this delicious flavor. I am totally hooked on Talenti brand gelato. I have enjoyed every flavor so far & I still have many more to try.\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by Baddie13 from Great Ice Cream This ice cream is delicious and is a great blend. I can taste the coffee and chocolate chips great together.\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by Mina from My life is now complete I was having a miserable day and I saw this in the store. Not much of a coffee person unless it\'s loaded with chocolate. Tried this as one of those what-the-hey-I\'ll-give-it-a-try moments and that first taste? [Insert angels singing here] DE-LOVIN-LICIOUS!!! The perfect amount of coffee taste, a ton of chocolate chips so no spoonful is left wanting, and my day got infinitely better after I downed half the jar in five minutes. Perfection in a jar. My only problem is trying to make it last before I can buy more! Yum yum yummy yummy yum! :D\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by best one so far from Best one so far Previous flavors I tried were super hard to open because they spilled gelato on the edge, making it extremely difficult to open. These were finally clean so it was easy to open. That was the first major PLUS in my book. Then I tried the gelato and was so impressed. It\'s the best coffee flavor I\'ve ever tasted. It\'s bolder than any other coffee flavored brands I\'ve tried so far. Normally I don\'t like ""stuff"" in my ice cream/gelato, but the ""chips"" in this one is more like shavings so it\'s not as noticeable (unlike their Double Dark Chocolate gelato which has chucks of chips).

Pour the coffee and chocolate mixtures into the bowl of dry ingredients and whisk just until smooth.\n\nPour into the prepared tin and bake at 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 for 40-45 minutes, or until the cake springs back to a light touch. Remove, leave to cool in the tin for 20 minutes, then take out of the tin, transfer to a rack and leave to cool completely.\n\nMeanwhile, melt the butter, chocolate and golden syrup in a large bowl using a bain-marie or microwave. Stir in the cream, then refrigerate until thickened and spreadable.\n\nCut the cake horizontally into two layers. Whisk the cream to soft peaks. Spread one of the cake layers with a little ganache and top with the cream, spreading it out evenly. Dollop on four tablespoons of the jam and swirl into the cream. Top with the halved blackberries, then lay the other cake half on top. Spread the remaining ganache all over the top and sides of the cake, decorate with the remaining blackberries and garnish with cocoa nibs and star anise (the latter for decoration only, of course).'";"Other";"595.txt-Other"
"596.txt";"b'For a year or so in high school, I\xe2\x80\x99d buy a peanut butter Kudos bar in the cafeteria at lunch time, then eat it slowly on the walk home. Kudos, for those who never had the pleasure, were a kind of granola-candy bar hybrid made by Mars that debuted in the late \xe2\x80\x9980s. Comprising a granola bar topped by a peanut butter layer pebbled with crispy rice, the whole thing enrobed in waxy chocolate, those slim bars fueled my adolescence.\n\nSo maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s no wonder that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been craving the combination of peanut butter and chocolate as I prepare to send my own children back to school \xe2\x80\x94 real, in-person, full-time school \xe2\x80\x94 for the first time in a long time. Kudos have been long since discontinued, but the appeal of a bar made with good peanut butter and excellent chocolate has not gone out of style among children or their mothers, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to report.\n\nThough these bars are inspired by Kudos, they\xe2\x80\x99re not intended to be a replica. I took some liberties: Instead of a granola bar, I make my version with a simple shortbread crust that\xe2\x80\x99s pressed into the pan with your fingertips; it\xe2\x80\x99s sturdy enough to give the bar structure, but with a tender crumb and an irresistible brown butter flavor. I top the crust with a second layer made from a combination of melted natural peanut butter and milk chocolate into which I stir puffed rice (or, if you prefer, Rice Krispies).\n\nI prefer natural smooth peanut butter for almost everything, these bars included \xe2\x80\x94 the milk chocolate gives the mixture plenty of sweetness, and I like its slightly coarse texture; if you want even more texture, use crunchy peanut butter. Almond butter can also be substituted. The bars are finished with a silky layer of dark chocolate, its bitterness acting as a foil for the sweet peanut butter layer. A dusting of finely chopped peanuts adds another textural element.\n\nI cut the bars into squat, skinny bars. While small, they are mighty, rich and intense.

"601.txt";"b'Food produced from the seed of Theobroma cacao\n\nChocolate is a food product made from roasted and ground cacao pods, that is available as a liquid, solid or paste, on its own or as a flavoring agent in other foods. Cacao has been consumed in some form since at least the Olmec civilization (19th-11th century BCE),[1][2] and the majority of Mesoamerican people - including the Maya and Aztecs - made chocolate beverages.[3]\n\nThe seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor. After fermentation, the beans are dried, cleaned, and roasted. The shell is removed to produce cocoa nibs, which are then ground to cocoa mass, unadulterated chocolate in rough form. Once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating, it is called chocolate liquor. The liquor may also be cooled and processed into its two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter. Baking chocolate, also called bitter chocolate, contains cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions, without any added sugar. Powdered baking cocoa, which contains more fiber than cocoa butter, can be processed with alkali to produce dutch cocoa. Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, a combination of cocoa solids, cocoa butter or added vegetable oils, and sugar. Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder or condensed milk. White chocolate contains cocoa butter, sugar, and milk, but no cocoa solids.\n\nChocolate is one of the most popular food types and flavors in the world, and many foodstuffs involving chocolate exist, particularly desserts, including cakes, pudding, mousse, chocolate brownies, and chocolate chip cookies. Many candies are filled with or coated with sweetened chocolate. Chocolate bars, either made of solid chocolate or other ingredients coated in chocolate, are eaten as snacks. Gifts of chocolate molded into different shapes (such as eggs, hearts, coins) are traditional on certain Western holidays, including Christmas, Easter, Valentine\'s Day, and Hanukkah. Chocolate is also used in cold and hot beverages, such as chocolate milk and hot chocolate, and in some alcoholic drinks, such as creme de cacao.\n\nAlthough cocoa originated in the Americas, West African countries, particularly C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire and Ghana, are the leading producers of cocoa in the 21st century, accounting for some 60% of the world cocoa supply.\n\nWith some two million children involved in the farming of cocoa in West Africa, child slavery and trafficking were major concerns in 2018,[4][5] and continue to be. International attempts to improve conditions for children were doomed to failure because of persistent poverty, absence of schools, increasing world cocoa demand, more intensive farming of cocoa, and continued exploitation of child labor.[4]\n\nHistory\n\nMesoamerican usage\n\nTwo Mayans sit around a container of frothed chocolate.\n\nChocolate has been prepared as a drink for nearly all of its history. For example, one vessel found at an Olmec archaeological site on the Gulf Coast of Veracruz, Mexico, dates chocolate\'s preparation by pre-Olmec peoples as early as 1750 BC.[6] On the Pacific coast of Chiapas, Mexico, a Mokaya archaeological site provides evidence of cocoa beverages dating even earlier, to 1900 BC.[7][6] The residues and the kind of vessel in which they were found indicate the initial use of cocoa was not simply as a beverage, but the white pulp around the cocoa beans was likely used as a source of fermentable sugars for an alcoholic drink.[8]\n\nMan Carrying a Cacao Pod, 1440\xe2\x80\x931521. Volcanic stone, traces of red pigment. Aztec., 1440\xe2\x80\x931521. Volcanic stone, traces of red pigment. Brooklyn Museum\n\nAn early Classic-period (460\xe2\x80\x93480 AD) Mayan tomb from the site in Rio Azul had vessels with the Maya glyph for cocoa on them with residue of a chocolate drink, suggests the Maya were drinking chocolate around 400 AD.[9] Documents in Maya hieroglyphs stated chocolate was used for ceremonial purposes, in addition to everyday life.[10] The Maya grew cacao trees in their backyards,[11] and used the cocoa seeds the trees produced to make a frothy, bitter drink.[12]\n\nBy the 15th century, the Aztecs gained control of a large part of Mesoamerica and adopted cocoa into their culture. They associated chocolate with Quetzalcoatl, who, according to one legend, was cast away by the other gods for sharing chocolate with humans,[13] and identified its extrication from the pod with the removal of the human heart in sacrifice.[14] In contrast to the Maya, who liked their chocolate warm, the Aztecs drank it cold, seasoning it with a broad variety of additives, including the petals of the Cymbopetalum penduliflorum tree, chile pepper, allspice, vanilla, and honey.\n\nThe Aztecs were unable to grow cocoa themselves, as their home in the Mexican highlands was unsuitable for it, so chocolate was a luxury imported into the empire.[13] Those who lived in areas ruled by the Aztecs were required to offer cocoa seeds in payment of the tax they deemed ""tribute"".[13] Cocoa beans were often used as currency.[15] For example, the Aztecs used a system in which one turkey cost 100 cocoa beans and one fresh avocado was worth three beans.[16]\n\nThe Maya and Aztecs associated cocoa with human sacrifice, and chocolate drinks specifically with sacrificial human blood. The Spanish royal chronicler Gonzalo Fern\xc3\xa1ndez de Oviedo y Vald\xc3\xa9s described a chocolate drink he had seen in Nicaragua in 1528, mixed with achiote: ""because those people are fond of drinking human blood, to make this beverage seem like blood, they add a little achiote, so that it then turns red. ... and part of that foam is left on the lips and around the mouth, and when it is red for having achiote, it seems a horrific thing, because it seems like blood itself.""\n\nEuropean adaptation\n\nThe morning chocolate by Chocolate soon became a fashionable drink of the European nobility after the discovery of the Americas.by Pietro Longhi ; Venice, 1775\xe2\x80\x931780\n\nUntil the 16th century, no European had ever heard of the popular drink from the Central American peoples.[13] Christopher Columbus and his son Ferdinand encountered the cocoa bean on Columbus\'s fourth mission to the Americas on 15 August 1502, when he and his crew seized a large native canoe that proved to contain cocoa beans among other goods for trade.[19] Spanish conquistador Hern\xc3\xa1n Cort\xc3\xa9s may have been the first European to encounter it, as the frothy drink was part of the after-dinner routine of Montezuma.[9][20] Jos\xc3\xa9 de Acosta, a Spanish Jesuit missionary who lived in Peru and then Mexico in the later 16th century, wrote of its growing influence on the Spaniards:\n\nAlthough bananas are more profitable, cocoa is more highly esteemed in Mexico. . . Cocoa is a smaller fruit than almonds and thicker, which toasted do not taste bad. It is so prized among the Indians and even among Spaniards. . . because since it is a dried fruit it can be stored for a long time without deterioration, and they brings ships loaded with them from the province of Guatemala. . . It also serves as currency, because with five cocoas you can buy one thing, with thirty another, and with a hundred something else, without there being contradiction; and they give these cocoas as alms to the poor who beg for them. The principal product of this cocoa is a concoction which they make that they call \xe2\x80\x9cchocolate,\xe2\x80\x9d which is a crazy thing treasured in that land, and those who are not accustomed are disgusted by it, because it has a foam on top and a bubbling like that of feces, which certainly takes a lot to put up with. Anyway, it is the prized beverage which the Indians offer to nobles who come to or pass through their lands; and the Spaniards, especially Spanish women born in those lands die for black chocolate. This aforementioned chocolate is said to the be made in various forms and temperaments, hot, cold, and lukewarm. They are wont to use spices and much chili; they also make it into a paste, and it is said that it is a medicine to treat coughs, the stomach, and colds. Whatever may be the case, in fact those who have not been reared on this opinion are not appetized by it.[21]\n\n""Trait\xc3\xa9s nouveaux & curieux du caf\xc3\xa9 du th\xc3\xa9 et du chocolate"", by Philippe Sylvestre Dufour, 1685 , by Philippe Sylvestre Dufour, 1685\n\nWhile Columbus had taken cocoa beans with him back to Spain,[19] chocolate made no impact until Spanish friars introduced it to the Spanish court.[13] After the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs, chocolate was imported to Europe. There, it quickly became a court favorite. It was still served as a beverage, but the Spanish added sugar, as well as honey (the original sweetener used by the Aztecs for chocolate), to counteract the natural bitterness.[22] Vanilla, another indigenous American introduction, was also a popular additive, with pepper and other spices sometimes used to give the illusion of a more potent vanilla flavor. Unfortunately, these spices tended to unsettle the European constitution; the Encyclop\xc3\xa9die states, ""The pleasant scent and sublime taste it imparts to chocolate have made it highly recommended; but a long experience having shown that it could potentially upset one\'s stomach"", which is why chocolate without vanilla was sometimes referred to as ""healthy chocolate"".[23] By 1602, chocolate had made its way from Spain to Austria.[24] By 1662, Pope Alexander VII had declared that religious fasts were not broken by consuming chocolate drinks. Within about a hundred years, chocolate established a foothold throughout Europe.[13]\n\nmoulinet or swizzle stick, London 1714\xe2\x80\x9315 ( Silver chocolate pot with hinged finial to insert aor swizzle stick, London 1714\xe2\x80\x9315 ( Victoria and Albert Museum\n\nThe new craze for chocolate brought with it a thriving slave market, as between the early 1600s and late 1800s, the laborious and slow processing of the cocoa bean was manual.[13] Cocoa plantations spread, as the English, Dutch, and French colonized and planted. With the depletion of Mesoamerican workers, largely to disease, cocoa production was often the work of poor wage laborers and African slaves. Wind-powered and horse-drawn mills were used to speed production, augmenting human labor. Heating the working areas of the table-mill, an innovation that emerged in France in 1732, also assisted in extraction.[25]\n\nNew processes that sped the production of chocolate emerged early in the Industrial Revolution. In 1815, Dutch chemist Coenraad van Houten introduced alkaline salts to chocolate, which reduced its bitterness.[13] A few years thereafter, in 1828, he created a press to remove about half the natural fat (cocoa butter or cocoa butter) from chocolate liquor, which made chocolate both cheaper to produce and more consistent in quality. This innovation introduced the modern era of chocolate.[19]\n\nKnown as ""Dutch cocoa"", this machine-pressed chocolate was instrumental in the transformation of chocolate to its solid form when, in 1847, English chocolatier Joseph Fry discovered a way to make chocolate moldable when he mixed the ingredients of cocoa powder and sugar with melted cocoa butter.[22] Subsequently, his chocolate factory, Fry\'s of Bristol, England, began mass-producing chocolate bars, Fry\'s Chocolate Cream, launched in 1866, and they became very popular.[26] Milk had sometimes been used as an addition to chocolate beverages since the mid-17th century, but in 1875 Swiss chocolatier Daniel Peter invented milk chocolate by mixing a powdered milk developed by Henri Nestl\xc3\xa9 with the liquor.[13][19] In 1879, the texture and taste of chocolate was further improved when Rudolphe Lindt invented the conching machine.[27]\n\nBesides Nestl\xc3\xa9, several notable chocolate companies had their start in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Rowntree\'s of York set up and began producing chocolate in 1862, after buying out the Tuke family business. Cadbury was manufacturing boxed chocolates in England by 1868.[13] Manufacturing their first Easter egg in 1875, Cadbury created the modern chocolate Easter egg after developing a pure cocoa butter that could easily be molded into smooth shapes.[28] In 1893, Milton S. Hershey purchased chocolate processing equipment at the World\'s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, and soon began the career of Hershey\'s chocolates with chocolate-coated caramels.\n\nIntroduction to the United States\n\nThe Baker Chocolate Company, which makes Baker\'s Chocolate, is the oldest producer of chocolate in the United States. In 1765 Dr. James Baker and John Hannon founded the company in Boston. Using cocoa beans from the West Indies, the pair built their chocolate business, which is still in operation.[29][30]\n\nWhite chocolate was first introduced to the U.S. in 1946 by Frederick E. Hebert of Hebert Candies in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, near Boston, after he had tasted ""white coat"" candies while traveling in Europe.[31][30]\n\nEtymology\n\nCocoa, pronounced by the Olmecs as kakawa,[1] dates to 1000 BC or earlier.[1] The word ""chocolate"" entered the English language from Spanish in about 1600.[32] The word entered Spanish from the word chocol\xc4\x81tl in Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs. The origin of the Nahuatl word is uncertain, as it does not appear in any early Nahuatl source, where the word for chocolate drink is cacahuatl, ""cocoa water"". It is possible that the Spaniards coined the word (perhaps in order to avoid caca, a vulgar Spanish word for ""faeces"") by combining the Yucatec Mayan word chocol, ""hot"", with the Nahuatl word atl, ""water"". A widely-cited proposal is that the derives from unattested xocolatl meaning ""bitter drink"" is unsupported; the change from x- to ch- is unexplained, as is the -l-. Another proposed etymology derives it from the word chicolatl, meaning ""beaten drink"", which may derive from the word for the frothing stick, chicoli.[34] Other scholars reject all these proposals, considering the origin of first element of the name to be unknown.[35] The term ""chocolatier"", for a chocolate confection maker, is attested from 1888.[36]\n\nTypes\n\nChocolate is commonly used as a coating for various fruits such as cherries and/or fillings, such as liqueurs\n\nSeveral types of chocolate can be distinguished. Pure, unsweetened chocolate, often called ""baking chocolate"", contains primarily cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions. Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, which combines chocolate with sugar.\n\nMilk\n\nMilk chocolate is sweet chocolate that also contains milk powder or condensed milk. In the UK and Ireland, milk chocolate must contain a minimum of 20% total dry cocoa solids; in the rest of the European Union, the minimum is 25%.[37]\n\nWhite\n\nWhite chocolate\n\nWhite chocolate, although similar in texture to that of milk and dark chocolate, does not contain any cocoa solids that impart a dark color. In 2002, the US Food and Drug Administration established a standard for white chocolate as the ""common or usual name of products made from cocoa fat (i.e., cocoa butter), milk solids, nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners, and other safe and suitable ingredients, but containing no nonfat cocoa solids"".[38]\n\nDark\n\nDark chocolate is produced by adding fat and sugar to the cocoa mixture. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration calls this ""sweet chocolate"", and requires a 15% concentration of chocolate liquor. European rules specify a minimum of 35% cocoa solids.[37] A higher amount of cocoa solids indicates more bitterness. Semisweet chocolate is dark chocolate with low sugar content. Bittersweet chocolate is chocolate liquor to which some sugar (typically a third), more cocoa butter and vanilla are added.[39] It has less sugar and more liquor than semisweet chocolate, but the two are interchangeable in baking. It is also known to last for two years if stored properly. As of 2017 , there is no high-quality evidence that dark chocolate affects blood pressure significantly or provides other health benefits.[40]\n\nUnsweetened\n\nUnsweetened chocolate is pure chocolate liquor, also known as bitter or baking chocolate. It is unadulterated chocolate: the pure, ground, roasted chocolate beans impart a strong, deep chocolate flavor. It is typically used in baking or other products to which sugar and other ingredients are added. Raw chocolate, often referred to as raw cocoa, is always dark and a minimum of 75% cocoa.\n\nUnsweetened ""Baking"" Chocolate\n\nPoorly tempered or untempered chocolate may have whitish spots on the dark chocolate part, called chocolate bloom; it is an indication that sugar or fat has separated due to poor storage. It is not toxic and can be safely consumed.[41]\n\nProduction\n\nChocolate is created from the cocoa bean. A cacao tree with fruit pods in various stages of ripening.\n\nRoughly two-thirds of the entire world\'s cocoa is produced in West Africa, with 43% sourced from C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire,[42] where, as of 2007 , child labor is a common practice to obtain the product.[43][44] According to the World Cocoa Foundation, in 2007 some 50 million people around the world depended on cocoa as a source of livelihood.[45] As of 2007 in the UK, most chocolatiers purchase their chocolate from them, to melt, mold and package to their own design.[46] According to the WCF\'s 2012 report, the Ivory Coast is the largest producer of cocoa in the world.[47] The two main jobs associated with creating chocolate candy are chocolate makers and chocolatiers. Chocolate makers use harvested cocoa beans and other ingredients to produce couverture chocolate (covering). Chocolatiers use the finished couverture to make chocolate candies (bars, truffles, etc.).[48]\n\nProduction costs can be decreased by reducing cocoa solids content or by substituting cocoa butter with another fat. Cocoa growers object to allowing the resulting food to be called ""chocolate"", due to the risk of lower demand for their crops.[45]\n\nGenome\n\nThe sequencing in 2010 of the genome of the cacao tree may allow yields to be improved.[49] Due to concerns about global warming effects on lowland climate in the narrow band of latitudes where cocoa is grown (20 degrees north and south of the equator), the commercial company Mars, Incorporated and the University of California, Berkeley are conducting genomic research in 2017\xe2\x80\x9318 to improve the survivability of cacao plants in hot climates.[50]\n\nCacao varieties\n\nChocolate is made from cocoa beans, the dried and fermented seeds of the cacao tree (Theobroma cacao), a small, 4\xe2\x80\x938 m tall (15\xe2\x80\x9326 ft tall) evergreen tree native to the deep tropical region of the Americas. Recent genetic studies suggest the most common genotype of the plant originated in the Amazon basin and was gradually transported by humans throughout South and Central America. Early forms of another genotype have also been found in what is now Venezuela. The scientific name, Theobroma, means ""food of the gods"".[51] The fruit, called a cocoa pod, is ovoid, 15\xe2\x80\x9330 cm (6\xe2\x80\x9312 in) long and 8\xe2\x80\x9310 cm (3\xe2\x80\x934 in) wide, ripening yellow to orange, and weighing about 500 g (1.1 lb) when ripe.\n\nCacao trees are small, understory trees that need rich, well-drained soils. They naturally grow within 20\xc2\xb0 of either side of the equator because they need about 2000 mm of rainfall a year, and temperatures in the range of 21 to 32 \xc2\xb0C (70 to 90 \xc2\xb0F). Cacao trees cannot tolerate a temperature lower than 15 \xc2\xb0C (59 \xc2\xb0F).[52]\n\nThe three main varieties of cocoa beans used in chocolate are criollo, forastero, and trinitario.\n\nCriollo\n\nRepresenting only 5% of all cocoa beans grown as of 2008 ,[53] criollo is the rarest and most expensive cocoa on the market, and is native to Central America, the Caribbean islands and the northern tier of South American states.[54] The genetic purity of cocoas sold today as criollo is disputed, as most populations have been exposed to the genetic influence of other varieties.\n\nCriollos are particularly difficult to grow, as they are vulnerable to a variety of environmental threats and produce low yields of cocoa per tree. The flavor of criollo is described as delicate yet complex, low in classic chocolate flavor, but rich in ""secondary"" notes of long duration.[55]\n\nForastero\n\nThe most commonly grown bean is forastero,[53] a large group of wild and cultivated cocoas, most likely native to the Amazon basin. The African cocoa crop is entirely made up of forastero. They are significantly hardier and of higher yield than criollo. The source of most chocolate marketed,[53] forastero cocoas are typically strong in classic ""chocolate"" flavor, but have a short duration and are unsupported by secondary flavors, producing ""quite bland"" chocolate.[53]\n\nTrinitario\n\nTrinitario is a natural hybrid of criollo and forastero. Trinitario originated in Trinidad after an introduction of forastero to the local criollo crop. Nearly all cocoa produced over the past five decades is of the forastero or lower-grade trinitario varieties.[56]\n\nProcessing\n\nCocoa pods are harvested by cutting them from the tree using a machete, or by knocking them off the tree using a stick. The beans with their surrounding pulp are removed from the pods and placed in piles or bins, allowing access to micro-organisms so fermentation of the pectin-containing material can begin. Yeasts produce ethanol, lactic acid bacteria produce lactic acid, and acetic acid bacteria produce acetic acid. The fermentation process, which takes up to seven days, also produces several flavor precursors, eventually resulting in the familiar chocolate taste.[57]\n\nIt is important to harvest the pods when they are fully ripe, because if the pod is unripe, the beans will have a low cocoa butter content, or sugars in the white pulp will be insufficient for fermentation, resulting in a weak flavor. After fermentation, the beans must be quickly dried to prevent mold growth. Climate and weather permitting, this is done by spreading the beans out in the sun from five to seven days.[58]\n\nThe dried beans are then transported to a chocolate manufacturing facility. The beans are cleaned (removing twigs, stones, and other debris), roasted, and graded. Next, the shell of each bean is removed to extract the nib. Finally, the nibs are ground and liquefied, resulting in pure chocolate in fluid form: chocolate liquor.[59] The liquor can be further processed into two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter.[60]\n\nBlending\n\nChocolate liquor is blended with the cocoa butter in varying quantities to make different types of chocolate or couverture. The basic blends of ingredients for the various types of chocolate (in order of highest quantity of cocoa liquor first), are:\n\nFountain chocolate is made with high levels of cocoa butter, allowing it to flow gently over a chocolate fountain to serve as dessert fondue\n\nDark chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa liquor, and (sometimes) vanilla\n\nMilk chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa liquor, milk or milk powder, and vanilla\n\nWhite chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, milk or milk powder, and vanilla\n\nUsually, an emulsifying agent, such as soy lecithin, is added, though a few manufacturers prefer to exclude this ingredient for purity reasons and to remain GMO-free, sometimes at the cost of a perfectly smooth texture. Some manufacturers are now using PGPR, an artificial emulsifier derived from castor oil that allows them to reduce the amount of cocoa butter while maintaining the same mouthfeel.\n\nThe texture is also heavily influenced by processing, specifically conching (see below). The more expensive chocolate tends to be processed longer and thus has a smoother texture and mouthfeel, regardless of whether emulsifying agents are added.\n\nDifferent manufacturers develop their own ""signature"" blends based on the above formulas, but varying proportions of the different constituents are used. The finest, plain dark chocolate couverture contains at least 70% cocoa (both solids and butter), whereas milk chocolate usually contains up to 50%. High-quality white chocolate couverture contains only about 35% cocoa butter.\n\nProducers of high-quality, small-batch chocolate argue that mass production produces bad-quality chocolate.[53] Some mass-produced chocolate contains much less cocoa (as low as 7% in many cases), and fats other than cocoa butter. Vegetable oils and artificial vanilla flavor are often used in cheaper chocolate to mask poorly fermented and/or roasted beans.[53]\n\nIn 2007, the Chocolate Manufacturers Association in the United States, whose members include Hershey, Nestl\xc3\xa9, and Archer Daniels Midland, lobbied the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to change the legal definition of chocolate to let them substitute partially hydrogenated vegetable oils for cocoa butter, in addition to using artificial sweeteners and milk substitutes.[61] Currently, the FDA does not allow a product to be referred to as ""chocolate"" if the product contains any of these ingredients.[62][63]\n\nIn the EU a product can be sold as chocolate if it contains up to 5% vegetable oil, and must be labeled as ""family milk chocolate"" rather than ""milk chocolate"" if it contains 20% milk.[64]\n\nAccording to Canadian Food and Drug Regulations,[65] a ""chocolate product"" is a food product that is sourced from at least one ""cocoa product"" and contains at least one of the following: ""chocolate, bittersweet chocolate, semi-sweet chocolate, dark chocolate, sweet chocolate, milk chocolate, or white chocolate"". A ""cocoa product"" is defined as a food product that is sourced from cocoa beans and contains ""cocoa nibs, cocoa liquor, cocoa mass, unsweetened chocolate, bitter chocolate, chocolate liquor, cocoa, low-fat cocoa, cocoa powder, or low-fat cocoa powder"".\n\nConching\n\nChocolate melanger mixing raw ingredients\n\nThe penultimate process is called conching. A conche is a container filled with metal beads, which act as grinders. The refined and blended chocolate mass is kept in a liquid state by frictional heat. Chocolate before conching has an uneven and gritty texture. The conching process produces cocoa and sugar particles smaller than the tongue can detect (typically around 20 \xce\xbcm) and reduces rough edges, hence the smooth feel in the mouth. The length of the conching process determines the final smoothness and quality of the chocolate. High-quality chocolate is conched for about 72 hours, and lesser grades about four to six hours. After the process is complete, the chocolate mass is stored in tanks heated to about 45 to 50 \xc2\xb0C (113 to 122 \xc2\xb0F) until final processing.[66]\n\nTempering\n\nVideo of cocoa beans being ground and mixed with other ingredients to make chocolate at a Mayordomo store in Oaxaca\n\nThe final process is called tempering. Uncontrolled crystallization of cocoa butter typically results in crystals of varying size, some or all large enough to be seen with the naked eye. This causes the surface of the chocolate to appear mottled and matte, and causes the chocolate to crumble rather than snap when broken.[67][68] The uniform sheen and crisp bite of properly processed chocolate are the results of consistently small cocoa butter crystals produced by the tempering process.\n\nThe fats in cocoa butter can crystallize in six different forms (polymorphous crystallization).[67][69] The primary purpose of tempering is to assure that only the best form is present. The six different crystal forms have different properties.\n\nCrystal Melting temp. Notes I 17 \xc2\xb0C (63 \xc2\xb0F) Soft, crumbly, melts too easily II 21 \xc2\xb0C (70 \xc2\xb0F) Soft, crumbly, melts too easily III 26 \xc2\xb0C (79 \xc2\xb0F) Firm, poor snap, melts too easily IV 28 \xc2\xb0C (82 \xc2\xb0F) Firm, good snap, melts too easily V 34 \xc2\xb0C (93 \xc2\xb0F) Glossy, firm, best snap, melts near body temperature (37 \xc2\xb0C) VI 36 \xc2\xb0C (97 \xc2\xb0F) Hard, takes weeks to form\n\nMolten chocolate and a piece of a chocolate bar\n\nAs a solid piece of chocolate, the cocoa butter fat particles are in a crystalline rigid structure that gives the chocolate its solid appearance. Once heated, the crystals of the polymorphic cocoa butter can break apart from the rigid structure and allow the chocolate to obtain a more fluid consistency as the temperature increases \xe2\x80\x93 the melting process. When the heat is removed, the cocoa butter crystals become rigid again and come closer together, allowing the chocolate to solidify.[70]\n\nThe temperature in which the crystals obtain enough energy to break apart from their rigid conformation would depend on the milk fat content in the chocolate and the shape of the fat molecules, as well as the form of the cocoa butterfat. Chocolate with a higher fat content will melt at a lower temperature.[71]\n\nMaking chocolate considered ""good"" is about forming as many type V crystals as possible. This provides the best appearance and texture and creates the most stable crystals, so the texture and appearance will not degrade over time. To accomplish this, the temperature is carefully manipulated during the crystallization.\n\npistoles and callets Chocolate cubes,and\n\nGenerally, the chocolate is first heated to 45 \xc2\xb0C (113 \xc2\xb0F) to melt all six forms of crystals.[67][69] Next, the chocolate is cooled to about 27 \xc2\xb0C (81 \xc2\xb0F), which will allow crystal types IV and V to form. At this temperature, the chocolate is agitated to create many small crystal ""seeds"" which will serve as nuclei to create small crystals in the chocolate. The chocolate is then heated to about 31 \xc2\xb0C (88 \xc2\xb0F) to eliminate any type IV crystals, leaving just type V. After this point, any excessive heating of the chocolate will destroy the temper and this process will have to be repeated. Other methods of chocolate tempering are used as well. The most common variant is introducing already tempered, solid ""seed"" chocolate. The temper of chocolate can be measured with a chocolate temper meter to ensure accuracy and consistency. A sample cup is filled with the chocolate and placed in the unit which then displays or prints the results.\n\nTwo classic ways of manually tempering chocolate are:\n\nWorking the molten chocolate on a heat-absorbing surface, such as a stone slab, until thickening indicates the presence of sufficient crystal ""seeds""; the chocolate is then gently warmed to working temperature.\n\nStirring solid chocolate into molten chocolate to ""inoculate"" the liquid chocolate with crystals (this method uses the already formed crystals of the solid chocolate to ""seed"" the molten chocolate).\n\nChocolate tempering machines (or temperers) with computer controls can be used for producing consistently tempered chocolate. In particular, continuous tempering machines are used in large volume applications. Various methods and apparatuses for continuous flow tempering have been described by Aasted, Sollich and Buhler, three manufacturers of commercial chocolate equipment, with a focus now on energy efficiency. In general, molten chocolate coming in at 40\xe2\x80\x9350 \xc2\xb0C is cooled in heat exchangers to crystallization temperates of about 26\xe2\x80\x9330 \xc2\xb0C, passed through a tempering column consisting of spinning plates to induce shear, then warmed slightly to re-melt undesirable crystal formations.[72][73]\n\nShaping\n\nChocolate is molded in different shapes for different uses:[74]\n\nChocolate bars (tablets) are rectangular blocks of chocolate meant to be broken down to cubes (or other predefined shapes), which can then be used for consumption, cooking and baking. The term is also used for combination bars, which are a type of candy bars\n\nChocolate chips are small pieces of chocolate, usually drop-like, which are meant for decoration and baking\n\nPistoles , callets and f\xc3\xa8ves are small, coin-like or bean-like pieces of chocolate meant for baking and patisserie applications (also see Pistole (coin) and F\xc3\xa8ve (trinket))\n\n, and are small, coin-like or bean-like pieces of chocolate meant for baking and patisserie applications (also see Pistole (coin) and F\xc3\xa8ve (trinket)) Chocolate blocks are large, cuboid chunks of chocolate meant for professional use and further processing\n\nOther, more specialized shapes for chocolate include sticks, curls and hollow semi-spheres\n\nStorage\n\nChocolate is very sensitive to temperature and humidity. Ideal storage temperatures are between 15 and 17 \xc2\xb0C (59 and 63 \xc2\xb0F), with a relative humidity of less than 50%. If refrigerated or frozen without containment, chocolate can absorb enough moisture to cause a whitish discoloration, the result of fat or sugar crystals rising to the surface. Various types of ""blooming"" effects can occur if chocolate is stored or served improperly.[75]\n\nChocolate bloom is caused by storage temperature fluctuating or exceeding 24 \xc2\xb0C (75 \xc2\xb0F), while sugar bloom is caused by temperature below 15 \xc2\xb0C (59 \xc2\xb0F) or excess humidity. To distinguish between different types of bloom, one can rub the surface of the chocolate lightly, and if the bloom disappears, it is fat bloom. Moving chocolate between temperature extremes, can result in an oily texture. Although visually unappealing, chocolate suffering from bloom is safe for consumption and taste unaffected.[76][77][78] Bloom can be reversed by retempering the chocolate or using it for any use that requires melting the chocolate.[79]\n\nChocolate is generally stored away from other foods, as it can absorb different aromas. Ideally, chocolates are packed or wrapped, and placed in proper storage with the correct humidity and temperature. Additionally, chocolate is frequently stored in a dark place or protected from light by wrapping paper. The glossy shine, snap, aroma, texture, and taste of the chocolate can show the quality and if it was stored well.[80]\n\nComposition\n\nNutrition\n\nA 100-gram serving of milk chocolate supplies 540 calories. It is 59% carbohydrates (52% as sugar and 3% as dietary fiber), 30% fat and 8% protein (table). Approximately 65% of the fat in milk chocolate is saturated, mainly palmitic acid and stearic acid, while the predominant unsaturated fat is oleic acid (table).\n\n100-grams of milk chocolate is an excellent source (over 19% of the Daily Value, DV) of riboflavin, vitamin B12 and the dietary minerals, manganese, phosphorus and zinc. Chocolate is a good source (10\xe2\x80\x9319% DV) of calcium, magnesium and iron.\n\nEffects on health\n\nChocolate may be a factor for heartburn in some people because one of its constituents, theobromine, may affect the esophageal sphincter muscle in a way that permits stomach acids to enter the esophagus.[81] Theobromine poisoning is an overdosage reaction to the bitter alkaloid, which happens more frequently in domestic animals than humans. However, daily intake of 50\xe2\x80\x93100 g cocoa (0.8\xe2\x80\x931.5 g theobromine) by humans has been associated with sweating, trembling and severe headache.[82] Chocolate contains alkaloids such as theobromine and phenethylamine, which have physiological effects in humans, but the presence of theobromine renders it toxic to some animals, including dogs and cats.[83]\n\nAccording to a 2005 study, the average lead concentration of cocoa beans is \xe2\x89\xa4 0.5 ng/g, which is one of the lowest reported values for a natural food.[84] However, during cultivation and production, chocolate may absorb lead from the environment (such as in atmospheric emissions of leaded gasoline, which is still being used in Nigeria).[84] Reports from 2014 indicate that ""chocolate might be a significant source"" of lead ingestion for children if consumption is high (with dark chocolate containing higher amounts),[85][86] and ""one 10 g cube of dark chocolate may contain as much as 20% of the daily lead oral limit.""[85]\n\nChocolate and cocoa contain moderate to high amounts of oxalate,[87][88] which may increase the risk of kidney stones.[89]\n\nA few studies have documented allergic reactions from chocolate in children.[81] Other research has shown that dark chocolate can aggravate acne in men who are prone to it.[90] Research has also shown that consuming dark chocolate does not substantially affect blood pressure.[40] Chocolate and cocoa are under preliminary research to determine if consumption affects the risk of certain cardiovascular diseases[91] or cognitive abilities.[92]\n\nOne tablespoonful (5 grams) of dry unsweetened cocoa powder has 12.1 mg of caffeine[93] and a 25-g single serving of dark chocolate has 22.4 mg of caffeine.[94] Although a single 7 oz. serving of coffee may contain 80\xe2\x80\x93175 mg,[95] studies have shown psychoactive effects in caffeine doses as low as 9 mg,[96] and a dose as low as 12.5 mg was shown to have effects on cognitive performance.[97]\n\nExcessive consumption of large quantities of any energy-rich food, such as chocolate, without a corresponding increase in activity to expend the associated calories, can cause weight gain and possibly lead to obesity.[81] Raw chocolate is high in cocoa butter, a fat which is removed during chocolate refining and then added back in varying proportions during the manufacturing process. Manufacturers may add other fats, sugars, and milk, all of which increase the caloric content of chocolate.[81]\n\nPhytochemicals\n\nIn comparison to most foods, cocoa contains more phenolic antioxidants.[98] Cocoa solids are a source of flavonoids[99] and alkaloids, such as theobromine, phenethylamine, and caffeine.[100]\n\nLabeling\n\nSome manufacturers provide the percentage of chocolate in a finished chocolate confection as a label quoting percentage of ""cocoa"" or ""cacao"". This refers to the combined percentage of both cocoa solids and cocoa butter in the bar, not just the percentage of cocoa solids.[101] The Belgian AMBAO certification mark indicates that no non-cocoa vegetable fats have been used in making the chocolate.[102][103] A long-standing dispute between Britain on the one hand and Belgium and France over British use of vegetable fats in chocolate ended in 2000 with the adoption of new standards which permitted the use of up to five percent vegetable fats in clearly labelled products.[104] This British style of chocolate has sometimes been pejoratively referred to as ""vegelate"".[104]\n\nChocolates that are organic[105] or fair trade certified[106] carry labels accordingly.\n\nIn the United States, some large chocolate manufacturers lobbied the federal government to permit confections containing cheaper hydrogenated vegetable oil in place of cocoa butter to be sold as ""chocolate"". In June 2007, in response to consumer concern about the proposal, the FDA reiterated ""Cacao fat, as one of the signature characteristics of the product, will remain a principal component of standardized chocolate.""[107]\n\nIndustry\n\nChocolate, prevalent throughout the world, is a steadily growing, US$50 billion-a-year worldwide business.[108] Europe accounts for 45% of the world\'s chocolate revenue,[109] and the US spent $20 billion in 2013.[110] Big Chocolate is the grouping of major international chocolate companies in Europe and the U.S. U.S. companies Mars and Hershey\'s alone generated $13 billion a year in chocolate sales and account for two-thirds of U.S. production in 2004.[111] Despite the expanding reach of the chocolate industry internationally, cocoa farmers and labourers in the Ivory Coast are unaware of the uses of the beans; the high cost of chocolate products in the Ivory Coast make it inaccessible to the majority of the population, who do not know what it tastes like.[112]\n\nManufacturers\n\nChocolate with various fillings\n\nChocolate manufacturers produce a range of products from chocolate bars to fudge. Large manufacturers of chocolate products include Cadbury (the world\'s largest confectionery manufacturer), Ferrero, Guylian, The Hershey Company, Lindt & Spr\xc3\xbcngli, Mars, Incorporated, Milka, Neuhaus and Suchard.\n\nGuylian is best known for its chocolate sea shells; Cadbury for its Dairy Milk and Creme Egg. The Hershey Company, the largest chocolate manufacturer in North America, produces the Hershey Bar and Hershey\'s Kisses.[113] Mars Incorporated, a large privately owned U.S. corporation, produces Mars Bar, Milky Way, M&M\'s, Twix, and Snickers. Lindt is known for its truffle balls and gold foil-wrapped Easter bunnies.\n\nFood conglomerates Nestl\xc3\xa9 SA and Kraft Foods both have chocolate brands. Nestl\xc3\xa9 acquired Rowntree\'s in 1988 and now markets chocolates under their brand, including Smarties (a chocolate candy) and Kit Kat (a chocolate bar); Kraft Foods through its 1990 acquisition of Jacobs Suchard, now owns Milka and Suchard. In February 2010, Kraft also acquired British-based Cadbury;[114] Fry\'s, Trebor Basset and the fair trade brand Green & Black\'s also belongs to the group.\n\nChild labor in cocoa harvesting\n\nThe widespread use of children in cocoa production is controversial, not only for the concerns about child labor and exploitation, but also because up to 12,000 of the 200,000 children working in C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire, the world\'s biggest producer of cocoa,[115] may be victims of trafficking or slavery.[116] Most attention on this subject has focused on West Africa, which collectively supplies 69 percent of the world\'s cocoa, and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire in particular, which supplies 35 percent of the world\'s cocoa. Thirty percent of children under age 15 in sub-Saharan Africa are child laborers, mostly in agricultural activities including cocoa farming.[118] Major chocolate producers, such as Nestl\xc3\xa9, buy cocoa at commodities exchanges where Ivorian cocoa is mixed with other cocoa.[119]\n\nIn 2009, Salvation Army International Development (SAID) UK stated that 12,000 children have been trafficked on cocoa farms in the Ivory Coast of Africa, where half of the world\'s chocolate is made.[120] SAID UK states that it is these child slaves who are likely to be working in ""harsh and abusive""[121] conditions for the production of chocolate,[120] and an increasing number of health-food[122] and anti-slavery[123] organisations are highlighting and campaigning against the use of trafficking in the chocolate industry.\n\nAs of 2017, approximately 2.1 million children in Ghana and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire were involved in farming cocoa, carrying heavy loads, clearing forests, and being exposed to pesticides.[5] According to Sona Ebai, the former secretary-general of the Alliance of Cocoa Producing Countries: ""I think child labor cannot be just the responsibility of industry to solve. I think it\'s the proverbial all-hands-on-deck: government, civil society, the private sector. And there, you need leadership.""[116] Reported in 2018, a 3-year pilot program \xe2\x80\x93 conducted by Nestl\xc3\xa9 with 26,000 farmers mostly located in C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire \xe2\x80\x93 observed a 51% decrease in the number of children doing hazardous jobs in cocoa farming.[4] The US Department of Labor formed the Child Labor Cocoa Coordinating Group as a public-private partnership with the governments of Ghana and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire to address child labor practices in the cocoa industry.[124] The International Cocoa Initiative involving major cocoa manufacturers established the Child Labor Monitoring and Remediation System intended to monitor thousands of farms in Ghana and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire for child labor conditions,[4][5] but the program reached less than 20% of the child laborers.[125] Despite these efforts, goals to reduce child labor in West Africa by 70% before 2020 are frustrated by persistent poverty, absence of schools, expansion of cocoa farmland, and increased demand for cocoa.[4][126]\n\nIn April 2018, the Cocoa Barometer report stated: ""Not a single company or government is anywhere near reaching the sector-wide objective of the elimination of child labor, and not even near their commitments of a 70% reduction of child labor by 2020"".[126]\n\nFair trade\n\nIn the 2000s, some chocolate producers began to engage in fair trade initiatives, to address concerns about the marginalization of cocoa laborers in developing countries. Traditionally, Africa and other developing countries received low prices for their exported commodities such as cocoa, which caused poverty to abound. Fairtrade seeks to establish a system of direct trade from developing countries to counteract this unfair system.[127] One solution for fair labor practices is for farmers to become part of an Agricultural cooperative. Cooperatives pay farmers a fair price for their cocoa so farmers have enough money for food, clothes, and school fees.[128] One of the main tenets of fair trade is that farmers receive a fair price, but this does not mean that the larger amount of money paid for fair trade cocoa goes directly to the farmers. The effectiveness of fair trade has been questioned. In a 2014 article, The Economist stated that workers on fair trade farms have a lower standard of living than on similar farms outside the fair trade system.[129]\n\nUsage and consumption\n\ns\'more topped with melted chocolate from a chocolate bar\n\nChocolate cake with chocolate frosting\n\nBars\n\nChocolate is sold in chocolate bars, which come in dark chocolate, milk chocolate and white chocolate varieties. Some bars that are mostly chocolate have other ingredients blended into the chocolate, such as nuts, raisins, or crisped rice. Chocolate is used as an ingredient in a huge variety of bars, which typically contain various confectionary ingredients (e.g., nougat, wafers, caramel, nuts, etc.) which are coated in chocolate.\n\nCoating and filling\n\nChocolate is used as a flavouring product in many desserts, such as chocolate cakes, chocolate brownies, chocolate mousse and chocolate chip cookies. Numerous types of candy and snacks contain chocolate, either as a filling (e.g., M&M\'s) or as a coating (e.g., chocolate-coated raisins or chocolate-coated peanuts).\n\nBeverages\n\nSome non-alcoholic beverages contain chocolate, such as chocolate milk, hot chocolate, chocolate milkshakes and tejate. Some alcoholic liqueurs are flavoured with chocolate, such as chocolate liqueur and creme de cacao. Chocolate is a popular flavour of ice cream and pudding, and chocolate sauce is a commonly added as a topping on ice cream sundaes. The caff\xc3\xa8 mocha is an espresso beverage containing chocolate.\n\nSee also\n\nReferences'";"Other";"601.txt-Other"

Also, those who had about two ounces of chocolate a week were 46 percent less likely to die from a stroke.\n\nA further study, published in the journal Heart in 2015, tracked the impact of diet on the long-term health of 25,000 men and women.\n\nThe findings suggested that eating up to 100 grams (g) of chocolate each day may be linked to a lower risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\n5) Fetal growth and development\n\nEating 30 g (about one ounce) of chocolate every day during pregnancy might benefit fetal growth and development, according to a study presented at the 2016 Pregnancy Meeting of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine in Atlanta, GA.\n\n6) Athletic performance\n\nShare on Pinterest Chocolate may help athletes cover more distance while using less oxygen.\n\nFindings published in The Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition suggest that a little dark chocolate might boost oxygen availability during fitness training.\n\nResearchers who studied cyclists doing time trials in the United Kingdom found that \xe2\x80\x9cAfter eating dark chocolate, the riders used less oxygen when cycling at a moderate pace and also covered more distance in a two-minute flat-out time trial.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe scientists believe that the success of dark chocolate in this case is that it contains flavonols known as epicatechins, which enhance the release of nitric oxide in the body.

"604.txt";"b'Chocolate is the most popular sweet treat in the world. People around the world (but mostly in Europe and the United States) consume more than 3 million tons of cocoa beans a year, according to the World Cocoa Foundation. And, not only does eating chocolate make you feel good, it may also be good for your heart and your brain.\n\nWhat is chocolate?\n\nChocolate is prepared from the fruit of the Theobroma cacao, a tropical tree whose name means ""food of the gods"" in Greek, according to ""Chocolate: Food of the Gods,"" an online exhibit by the Cornell University Library.\n\nTheobroma cacao trees are native to the Amazon and Orinoco river basins in South America. The trees are widely distributed from southeastern Mexico to the Amazon River. They thrive in hot, humid areas within about 20 degrees of the equator, according to Cornell. As the popularity of chocolate spread, growers established plantations in other regions, such as West Africa and South and Southeast Asia. Today, Ghana, C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire, Nigeria, Indonesia and Brazil account for 79 percent of the world\'s cacao production.\n\nCacao trees bear fruit that are about the same size and shape of a papaya, according to Patric Chocolate. These bumpy, lumpy berries, or pods, are full of up to 50 sour seeds, or beans, covered in white pulp.\n\nCacao seeds are harvested by hand because machines could injure the trees, according to Cornell. Workers remove the pods, which are orange when they are ripe, and open them with a machete. The seeds are placed in large fermentation trays that are stacked and covered in banana leaves, where they are left for two to seven days. Fermentation produces the chocolate flavor and aroma. It also destroys the seed\'s embryo, preventing unwanted germination, and causes the white pulp to fall away from the seeds.\n\nAfter fermenting, the beans dry out on sunny platforms. Workers turn them several times a day for three to five days to complete drying. The beans can dry faster in rotary driers but sun-dried beans taste the best, according to Cornell.\n\nNext, the beans are taken to the chocolate factory, where they are cleaned and debris is removed. The beans are roasted in large, rotating ovens. The roasting draws out flavor and removes the beans from their hulls. Roasted beans go into a winnowing machine, which cracks the beans and removes hulls. The remaining part of the bean is called the nib. Nibs become chocolate.\n\nThe nibs are ground down under a series of rollers. This process results in a thick paste called chocolate liquor. Chocolate liquor does not contain alcohol (however, chocolate liqueur does). It is the main source of unsweetened baking chocolate, according to Pam Williams, co-founder and past president of the Fine Chocolate Industry Association (FCIA) and founder and lead instructor of Ecole Cocolat Professional School of Chocolate Arts.\n\nAt this stage, the type of chocolate being produced is determined. According to the FCIA, ingredients separate fine chocolate from that of average quality. ""Fine chocolate,"" as designated by the FCIA, contains only cacao liquor, cacao butter (optional), sugar, lecithin, vanilla (optional) and possibly milk fats and solids. Additional flavors or ingredients like nuts can be added later.\n\n(Image credit: Dreamstime)\n\nTypes of chocolate\n\nFine chocolate falls into three categories: dark chocolate, milk chocolate and white chocolate, Williams said.\n\nDark chocolate has chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, lecithin, sugar and vanilla.\n\nMilk chocolate has all of the above plus milk fats and milk solids.\n\nWhite chocolate contains everything milk chocolate does except chocolate liquor.\n\nChocolatiers debate whether white chocolate is really chocolate. Until 2002, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration considered it a confectionary rather than chocolate because it does not contain chocolate liquor. The Hershey Food Corp. and the Chocolate Manufacturers Association petitioned the FDA, which added a standard of identity for white chocolate. Because the FDA refers to it as white chocolate, rather than confectionary, some experts, like Williams, accept white chocolate as chocolate.\n\nWithin the three categories, the FDA also acknowledges several grades, Williams said. They include unsweetened or brute, which can be up to 99 percent chocolate liquor; bittersweet; semisweet; and dark milk chocolate. The type of chocolate depends on what ingredients are present and the percentage of cocoa, in addition to where the beans are from and the way they are prepared.\n\nHealth benefits of chocolate\n\nGood heart food\n\nSeveral recent studies have examined the role that chocolate may have on heart health. Cacao beans are full of phytonutrients, which act as antioxidants and provide additional benefits. Furthermore, cacao beans are rich sources of iron, copper, magnesium, zinc and phosphorus, according to the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Dark chocolate contains two to three times more beneficial flavanols than milk chocolate because milk chocolate\'s cacao concentration is diluted with milk and possibly more sugar.\n\nWhile most studies have found some correlation between chocolate consumption and reduced risk of heart problems, the amount and type of chocolate needed requires further study. A 2017 meta-analysis of the effects of chocolate on coronary heart disease, stroke and diabetes published in the journal Nutrients concluded that the most benefit was associated with moderate chocolate intake. The authors found little benefit in heart disease or stroke reduction among people who consumed chocolate more than three times a week. Protective effects against diabetes emerged at two servings a week, but that benefit disappeared if people had more than six servings a week.\n\nOn the other hand, the findings of a large-scale study of more than 150,000 primarily male U.S. veterans who did not have coronary artery disease at the beginning of the study, suggest that eating an ounce of chocolate at least five times a week may help prevent the risk of coronary artery disease-related events like heart attack and heart failure.\n\nChocolate may also help prevent the development of atrial fibrillation, a type of irregular heartbeat that increases the risk of heart failure, stroke and more. A study, published in the journal Heart in 2017, found that adults who ate chocolate at least once a month had 10 to 20 percent lower rates of developing atrial fibrillation than those who never or rarely ate chocolate.\n\nGood brain food\n\nChocolate may be good for the brain. Some studies have focused on chocolate\'s ability to improve cognitive function. A study published in the Journal of Alzheimer\'s Disease in 2016 found that chocolate consumption might lower the risk of cognitive decline in older people. The study looked at nearly 400 Portuguese citizens over age 65 and saw that those who ate a moderate amount of chocolate \xe2\x80\x94 on average, one chocolate snack a week; the study did not differentiate between milk and dark chocolate \xe2\x80\x94 decreased their risk of cognitive decline by 40 percent over two years. Those who ate more chocolate, or those who had more caffeine, saw fewer cognitive benefits.\n\nGood mood food\n\nChocolate is often associated with positive effects on mood, but the reasons why it makes some people feel good are debatable. Chocolate contains substances that stimulate the brain in the same way cannabis does, such as anandamines, and substances that have similar effects as amphetamine, such as tyramine and phenylethylamine, according to the Dartmouth Undergraduate Journal of Science. However, these substances are in very low concentrations \xe2\x80\x94 too low to induce an antidepressant effect.\n\nChocolate may interact with neurotransmitter systems that contribute to appetite, reward and mood regulation, such as dopamine, serotonin and endorphins, according to the 2013 article in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology. However, the authors noted, the effects may have more to do with chocolate\'s taste and smell than its chemical effects.\n\nA 2010 study published in Archives of Internal Medicine found a link between depression and chocolate consumption. The results showed that people who scored high on a screening test for depression consumed more chocolate than those who weren\'t considered depressed. However, the study pointed out that there is only a link, and cannot explain why. Since the participants were not followed over time, the researchers don\'t know whether eating chocolate ameliorates or amplifies a sad mood. The possibilities are many \xe2\x80\x94 from using chocolate as a sort of natural Prozac to the idea that chocolate might have some role in driving depression.\n\nHealth risks of eating chocolate\n\nLike many foods, chocolate is healthiest when eaten in moderation. The sugars and fats that are added to chocolate make it high in calories, which may lead to weight gain. Furthermore, many of the protective effects that chocolate may offer might be mitigated by overconsumption.\n\nHistory of chocolate\n\nScientists debate how long humans have been using and consuming cacao beans. Chocolate\'s history goes back at least 2,000 years, while historians Sophie and Michael Coe, authors of ""The True History of Chocolate"" (Thames and Hudson, 2013), suggest that it might go back four millennia. The word chocolate can be traced back to the Aztec word ""xocoatl,"" the name for a bitter drink made from cacao beans. This was the way chocolate was consumed until the Spanish conquistadors came to Central America.\n\nIn several pre-Columbian Latin American societies, cacao beans were used as currency, according to Smithsonian magazine. Mayans and Aztecs believed the beans had mystical properties and used them during important rituals. When the Spanish arrived, sweetened chocolate came into existence. Legend has it that the Aztec king Montezuma gave conquistador Hern\xc3\xa1n Cort\xc3\xa9s a bitter chocolate drink, which he said was disgusting. But Cort\xc3\xa9s\' men added cane sugar and honey to it and took it back to Spain, where it quickly became popular.\n\nChocolate was a fashionable drink for rich Europeans throughout the 18th century. The Industrial Revolution allowed chocolate to be mass-produced and brought the treat to the masses. The popularity led to the development of cacao tree plantations.\n\nEnslaved people farmed most of the plantations. Initially, Spanish colonizers forced Mesoamericans to farm the cacao plantations, according to ""The Biography of Chocolate"" (Crabtree Publishing Co., 2005), by Adrianna Morganelli. When the indigenous peoples began to die in large numbers from diseases brought by Europeans, enslaved Africans were brought over to make up the labor shortage. In addition to sugarcane, indigo and other crops, enslaved Africans planted, maintained and harvested cacao trees throughout the Caribbean, Central and South America to feed the new European taste for chocolate.\n\nIn 1815, Dutch physicist Coenraad Van Houten experimented with removing varied amounts of the cocoa butter from chocolate liquor, according to Cornell University. This led to the creation of cocoa powder and soon solid chocolate.\n\nIn 1847, a Bristol, England, chocolate company, Fry\'s, created the first mass-produced chocolate bar when Joseph Fry added additional cocoa butter to Van Houten\'s chocolate, which turned it into a moldable paste, according to Bristol Museums. Milk chocolate was invented soon after with the help of Henri Nestl\xc3\xa9, who went on to found the major food company that bears his name. Major European chocolate brands Lindt and Cadbury also got their start in the 1800s; Rodolphe Lindt invented the conching machine, which gives chocolate a velvety texture.\n\nMass chocolate consumption hit the United States in the late 1800s when Milton S. Hershey began selling chocolate-coated caramels. He then developed his own formula for milk chocolate, purchased chocolate factory equipment and introduced mass-produced chocolate bars and other shapes, like Hershey\'s Kisses, in 1900.\n\nIn 1923, the Mars Co. developed the Milky Way bar by putting nougat inside a chocolate bar. That same year, former Hershey employee H.B. Reese introduced Reese\'s Peanut Butter Cups, which later became part of the Hershey brand.\n\nAs the years progressed, chocolate concoctions from both small and large producers became increasingly innovative. In September 2017, Swiss chocolate company Barry Callebaut introduced ruby chocolate. Ruby chocolate comes from isolating specific compounds in cocoa beans, according to Confectionary News. That, along with a modified processing technique, results in a rosy pink chocolate that has a sweet but sour berry taste and no traditional chocolate flavor, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. Other colored chocolates are made from dyed white chocolate.\n\nThreats to chocolate\n\nChocolate production is threatened by climate change. According to a 2016 report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the primary cacao-producing countries of C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire, Ghana, and Indonesia will experience a 2.1 degree Celsius (3.7 degrees Fahrenheit) increase in temperature by 2050. Rainfall will not rise along with the temperature, causing lowered humidity levels. As a result, viable land for cacao production will significantly shrink. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\'s Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability report, 89.5 percent of the 294 chocolate-producing locations studied would become less suitable by 2050.\n\nFarmers and scientists are working to develop strategies to maintain chocolate production. Some farmers are planting taller trees next to cacao trees to increase shade and decrease moisture loss, according to the NOAA. Cacao plantations may also move to higher elevations with cooler temperatures and greater rainfall.\n\nGenetic scientists are taking a different approach. A January 2018 press release from the Innovative Genomics Institute announced a project to develop disease-resistant cacao. Condensing cacao plantations because of climate change could increase the spread of disease. The project will use CRISPR DNA-editing technology to make a heartier cacao seed.\n\nEthics of chocolate production\n\nAccording to Slave Free Chocolate, 2.3 million children work in chocolate production in Ghana and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire, where they are vulnerable to trafficking, slavery and other violent labor practices. The International Labor Rights Forum reports that these children are often exposed to chemicals, work long hours and are denied education. According to Epicure and Culture, many children are sold into slavery and never see their families again. Others are kidnapped.\n\nThough the Harkin-Engel Protocol of 2001 was designed to stop child labor in the chocolate industry, according to the CNN Freedom Project, little has changed. The deadlines for action have been repeatedly pushed back.\n\nConsumers who want ethical chocolate should look for certifications designating Fair Trade, Rain Forest Alliance, UTZ, and Fair for Life, according to Slave Free Chocolate\xe2\x80\x99s guide to chocolate companies.\n\nChocolate production can also harm the environment. Farmers often clear forests to make room for cacao plantations. According to the World Wildlife Fund, about 70 percent of C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire\'s illegal deforestation is related to cacao farming. One danger of deforestation is soil erosion, which can make land less fertile for cacao plants, creating a vicious cycle, according to Confectionary News.\n\nAdditional resources'";"Other";"604.txt-Other"

The Maya considered chocolate to be the food of the gods, held the cacao tree to be sacred, and buried dignitaries with bowls of chocolate.\n\nFull Article\n\nchocolate , food product made from cocoa beans , consumed as candy and used to make beverages and to flavour or coat various confections and bakery products. Rich in carbohydrates , it is an excellent source of quick energy, and it also contains minute amounts of the stimulating alkaloids theobromine and caffeine .\n\nHistory of chocolate\n\nThe cacao tree was cultivated more than 3,000 years ago by the Maya, Toltec, and Aztec peoples, who prepared a beverage from its fruit, the cocoa bean (sometimes using it as a ceremonial drink) and also used the bean as a currency. The Maya considered chocolate to be the food of the gods, held the cacao tree to be sacred, and even buried dignitaries with bowls of the substance (along with other items deemed useful in the afterlife). In fact, the identification of the (Olmec-originated) word ka-ka-w (\xe2\x80\x9ccacao\xe2\x80\x9d) inscribed on those containers was key to deciphering the Maya\xe2\x80\x99s phonetic manner of writing.\n\nSpain was the earliest European country to incorporate chocolate into its cuisine, but exactly how that happened is vague. It is known that Christopher Columbus took cocoa beans to Spain after his fourth voyage in 1502, though little was made of it at that time. It has been commonly thought (though there appears to be no evidence) that in 1519 Montezuma II, the Aztec ruler of Mexico, served a bitter cocoa-bean drink to the Spanish conquistador Hern\xc3\xa1n Cort\xc3\xa9s, who subsequently introduced the drink to Spain. A strong possibility is that chocolate first arrived in Spain in 1544 with representatives of the Kekch\xc3\xad Mayan people of Guatemala, who came bearing gifts (including chocolate) to visit the court of Prince Philip. However, it was not until 1585 that the first recorded shipment of cocoa beans arrived in Spain from Veracruz, Mexico. Sweetened and flavoured with cinnamon and vanilla, chocolate was served as a hot beverage and became quite popular in the Spanish court. It was many years before chocolate had its introduction to France, England, and beyond.\n\nengraving of an Aztec with cocoa beans and chocolate beverage \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican with his chocolate pot and goblet,\xe2\x80\x9d an engraving of an Aztec with cocoa beans and chocolate beverage, from a French history of chocolate, tea, and coffee, 1685. From Traitez Nouveaux and curieux du caf\xc3\xa9 du th\xc3\xa9 et du chocolate, by Philippe Sylvestre Dufour, 1685\n\nIn 1657 a Frenchman opened a shop in London at which solid chocolate for making the beverage could be purchased at 10 to 15 shillings per pound. At that price only the wealthy could afford to drink it, and there appeared in London, Amsterdam, and other European capitals fashionable chocolate houses, some of which later developed into famous private clubs. In London many chocolate houses were used as political party meeting places as well as high-stakes gambling spots, notably Cocoa-Tree Chocolate-House (later the Cocoa-Tree Club), which opened in 1698, and White\xe2\x80\x99s, which was opened by Francis White in 1693 as White\xe2\x80\x99s Chocolate-House. About 1700 the English improved chocolate by the addition of milk. The reduction of the cost of the beverage was hampered in Great Britain by the imposition of high import duties on the raw cocoa bean, and it was not until the mid-19th century, when the duty was lowered to a uniform rate of one penny per pound, that chocolate became popular.\n\nMeanwhile, the making of chocolate spread overseas and grew in sophistication. Chocolate manufacture started in the American colonies in 1765 at Dorchester, Massachusetts, using beans brought in by New England sea captains from their voyages to the West Indies. James Baker financed the first mill, which was operated by an Irish immigrant, John Hanan. Waterpower was used for grinding the beans. In the Netherlands in 1828, C.J. van Houten patented a process for pressing much of the fat, or cocoa butter, from ground and roasted cocoa beans and thus obtaining cocoa powder. In 1847 the English firm of Fry and Sons combined cocoa butter with chocolate liquor and sugar to produce sweet (eating) chocolate\xe2\x80\x94the base of most chocolate confectionary\xe2\x80\x94and in 1876 Daniel Peter of Switzerland added dried milk to make milk chocolate.

"610.txt";"b'Share on Pinterest Screen Moment/Stocksy United Dark chocolate is loaded with nutrients that can positively affect your health. Made from the seed of the cacao tree, it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the best sources of antioxidants you can find. Studies show that dark chocolate can improve your health and lower the risk of heart disease. This article reviews 7 health benefits of dark chocolate or cocoa that are supported by science.\n\n1. Very nutritious If you buy quality dark chocolate with a high cocoa content, then it\xe2\x80\x99s quite nutritious. It contains a decent amount of soluble fiber and is loaded with minerals. A 100-gram bar of dark chocolate with 70\xe2\x80\x9385% cocoa contains (1): 11 grams of fiber\n\n67% of the DV for iron\n\n58% of the DV for magnesium\n\n89% of the DV for copper\n\n98% of the DV for manganese In addition, it has plenty of potassium, phosphorus, zinc, and selenium. Of course, 100 grams (3.5 ounces) is a fairly large amount and not something you should be consuming daily. These nutrients also come with 600 calories and moderate amounts of sugar. For this reason, dark chocolate is best consumed in moderation. The fatty acid profile of cocoa and dark chocolate is also good. The fats consist mostly of oleic acid (a heart-healthy fat also found in olive oil), stearic acid, and palmitic acid. The stearic acid has a neutral effect on body cholesterol. Palmitic acid can raise cholesterol levels, but it only makes up one-third of the total fat calories. Dark chocolate also contains stimulants like caffeine and theobromine, but it\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely to keep you awake at night, as the amount of caffeine is very small compared with coffee. Summary Quality dark chocolate is rich in fiber, iron, magnesium, copper, manganese, and a few other minerals.\n\n2. Powerful source of antioxidants ORAC stands for oxygen radical absorbance capacity. It\xe2\x80\x99s a measure of the antioxidant activity of foods. Basically, researchers set a bunch of free radicals (bad) against a sample of a food and see how well the antioxidants in the food can disarm the free radicals. The biological relevance of ORAC values is questioned, as it\xe2\x80\x99s measured in a test tube and may not have the same effect in the body. However, it\xe2\x80\x99s worth mentioning that raw, unprocessed cocoa beans are among the highest-scoring foods that have been tested. Dark chocolate is loaded with organic compounds that are biologically active and function as antioxidants. These include polyphenols, flavanols and catechins, among others. One study showed that cocoa and dark chocolate had more antioxidant activity, polyphenols, and flavanols than any other fruits tested, which included blueberries and acai berries (2). Summary Cocoa and dark chocolate have a wide variety of powerful antioxidants. In fact, they have way more than most other foods.\n\n3. May improve blood flow and lower blood pressure The flavanols in dark chocolate can stimulate the endothelium, the lining of arteries, to produce nitric oxide (NO) ( 3 ). One of the functions of NO is to send signals to the arteries to relax, which lowers the resistance to blood flow and therefore reduces blood pressure. Many controlled studies show that cocoa and dark chocolate can improve blood flow and lower blood pressure, though the effects are usually mild ( 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ). However, one study in people with high blood pressure showed no effect, so take this with a grain of salt ( 8 ). Given the great variation between studies on this subject, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that more research is needed ( 9 , 10). Summary The bioactive compounds in cocoa may improve blood flow in the arteries and cause a small but statistically significant decrease in blood pressure.\n\n4. Raises HDL and protects LDL from oxidation Consuming dark chocolate can improve several important risk factors for heart disease. In a controlled study, cocoa powder was found to significantly decrease oxidized LDL (bad) cholesterol in men. It also increased HDL and lowered total LDL for those with high cholesterol ( 11 ). Oxidized LDL means that the LDL cholesterol has reacted with free radicals. This makes the LDL particle itself reactive and capable of damaging other tissues, such as the lining of the arteries in your heart. It makes perfect sense that cocoa lowers oxidized LDL. It contains an abundance of powerful antioxidants that do make it into the bloodstream and protect lipoproteins against oxidative damage ( 12 , 13 , 14 ). The flavanols in dark chocolate can also reduce insulin resistance, which is another common risk factor for diseases like heart disease and diabetes ( 15 , 16 , 17 ). However, dark chocolate also contains sugar, which can have the opposite effect. Summary Dark chocolate improves several important risk factors for disease. It lowers the susceptibility of LDL to oxidative damage while increasing HDL and improving insulin sensitivity.\n\n5. May reduce heart disease risk The compounds in dark chocolate appear to be highly protective against the oxidation of LDL. In the long term, this should cause much less cholesterol to lodge in the arteries, resulting in a lower risk of heart disease. In fact, several long-term observational studies show a fairly drastic improvement. In a study of 470 older men, cocoa was found to reduce the risk of death from heart disease by 50% over 15 years ( 18 ). Another study revealed that eating chocolate two or more times per week lowered the risk of having calcified plaque in the arteries by 32%. Eating chocolate less frequently had no effect ( 19 ). Yet another study showed that eating dark chocolate more than five times per week lowered the risk of heart disease by 57% ( 20 ). A 2017 clinical trial found that subjects who consumed almonds with or without dark chocolate showed improved LDL cholesterol levels (21). Of course, these four studies are observational, so it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear exactly if it was the chocolate that reduced the risk. However, since the biological process is known (lower blood pressure and oxidized LDL), it\xe2\x80\x99s plausible that regularly eating dark chocolate may reduce the risk of heart disease. Summary Observational studies show a drastic reduction in heart disease risk among those who consume the most chocolate.\n\n6. May protect your skin from the sun The bioactive compounds in dark chocolate may also be great for your skin. The flavanols can protect against sun damage, improve blood flow to the skin, and increase skin density and hydration ( 22 ). The minimal erythemal dose (MED) is the minimum amount of UVB rays required to cause redness in the skin 24 hours after exposure. In one study of 30 people, the MED more than doubled after consuming dark chocolate high in flavanols for 12 weeks ( 23 ). If you\xe2\x80\x99re planning a beach vacation, consider enjoying some extra dark chocolate in the prior weeks and months. But check with your doctor or dermatologist before forgoing your normal skin care routine in favor of more dark chocolate. Summary Studies show that the flavanols from cocoa can improve blood flow to the skin and protect it from sun damage.\n\n7. Could improve brain function The good news isn\xe2\x80\x99t over yet. Dark chocolate may also improve the function of your brain. One study of healthy volunteers showed that eating high flavanol cocoa for 5 days improved blood flow to the brain ( 24 ). Cocoa may also significantly improve cognitive function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment. It may improve verbal fluency and several risk factors for disease, as well ( 25 ). Additionally, cocoa contains stimulant substances like caffeine and theobromine, which may be a key reason why it can improve brain function in the short term ( 26 ). Summary Cocoa or dark chocolate may improve brain function by increasing blood flow. It also contains stimulants like caffeine and theobromine.'";"Other";"610.txt-Other"
"617.txt";"b'When most of us hear the word chocolate, we picture a bar, a box of bonbons, or a bunny. The verb that comes to mind is probably ""eat,"" not ""drink,"" and the most apt adjective would seem to be ""sweet."" But for about 90 percent of chocolate\'s long history, it was strictly a beverage, and sugar didn\'t have anything to do with it.\n\n""I often call chocolate the best-known food that nobody knows anything about,"" said Alexandra Leaf, a self-described ""chocolate educator"" who runs a business called Chocolate Tours of New York City.\n\nThe terminology can be a little confusing, but most experts these days use the term ""cacao"" to refer to the plant or its beans before processing, while the term ""chocolate"" refers to anything made from the beans, she explained. ""Cocoa"" generally refers to chocolate in a powdered form, although it can also be a British form of ""cacao.""\n\nEtymologists trace the origin of the word ""chocolate"" to the Aztec word ""xocoatl,"" which referred to a bitter drink brewed from cacao beans. The Latin name for the cacao tree, Theobroma cacao, means ""food of the gods.""\n\nMany modern historians have estimated that chocolate has been around for about 2000 years, but recent research suggests that it may be even older.\n\nIn the book The True History of Chocolate, authors Sophie and Michael Coe make a case that the earliest linguistic evidence of chocolate consumption stretches back three or even four millennia, to pre-Columbian cultures of Mesoamerica such as the Olmec.\n\nLast November, anthropologists from the University of Pennsylvania announced the discovery of cacao residue on pottery excavated in Honduras that could date back as far as 1400 B.C.E. It appears that the sweet pulp of the cacao fruit, which surrounds the beans, was fermented into an alcoholic beverage of the time.\n\n""Who would have thought, looking at this, that you can eat it?"" said Richard Hetzler, executive chef of the caf\xc3\xa9 at the Smithsonian\'s National Museum of the American Indian, as he displayed a fresh cacao pod during a recent chocolate-making demonstration. ""You would have to be pretty hungry, and pretty creative!""\n\nIt\'s hard to pin down exactly when chocolate was born, but it\'s clear that it was cherished from the start. For several centuries in pre-modern Latin America, cacao beans were considered valuable enough to use as currency. One bean could be traded for a tamale, while 100 beans could purchase a good turkey hen, according to a 16th-century Aztec document.\n\nBoth the Mayans and Aztecs believed the cacao bean had magical, or even divine, properties, suitable for use in the most sacred rituals of birth, marriage and death. According to Chloe Doutre-Roussel\'s book The Chocolate Connoisseur, Aztec sacrifice victims who felt too melancholy to join in ritual dancing before their death were often given a gourd of chocolate (tinged with the blood of previous victims) to cheer them up. Sweetened chocolate didn\'t appear until Europeans discovered the Americas and sampled the native cuisine. Legend has it that the Aztec king Montezuma welcomed the Spanish explorer Hernando Cortes with a banquet that included drinking chocolate, having tragically mistaken him for a reincarnated deity instead of a conquering invader. Chocolate didn\'t suit the foreigners\' tastebuds at first \xe2\x80\x93one described it in his writings as ""a bitter drink for pigs"" \xe2\x80\x93 but once mixed with honey or cane sugar, it quickly became popular throughout Spain. By the 17th century, chocolate was a fashionable drink throughout Europe, believed to have nutritious, medicinal and even aphrodisiac properties (it\'s rumored that Casanova was especially fond of the stuff). But it remained largely a privilege of the rich until the invention of the steam engine made mass production possible in the late 1700s. In 1828, a Dutch chemist found a way to make powdered chocolate by removing about half the natural fat (cacao butter) from chocolate liquor, pulverizing what remained and treating the mixture with alkaline salts to cut the bitter taste. His product became known as ""Dutch cocoa,"" and it soon led to the creation of solid chocolate. The creation of the first modern chocolate bar is credited to Joseph Fry, who in 1847 discovered that he could make a moldable chocolate paste by adding melted cacao butter back into Dutch cocoa. By 1868, a little company called Cadbury was marketing boxes of chocolate candies in England. Milk chocolate hit the market a few years later, pioneered by another name that may ring a bell \xe2\x80\x93 Nestle. In America, chocolate was so valued during the Revolutionary War that it was included in soldiers\' rations and used in lieu of wages. While most of us probably wouldn\'t settle for a chocolate paycheck these days, statistics show that the humble cacao bean is still a powerful economic force. Chocolate manufacturing is a more than 4-billion-dollar industry in the United States, and the average American eats at least half a pound of the stuff per month. In the 20th century, the word ""chocolate"" expanded to include a range of affordable treats with more sugar and additives than actual cacao in them, often made from the hardiest but least flavorful of the bean varieties (forastero). But more recently, there\'s been a ""chocolate revolution,"" Leaf said, marked by an increasing interest in high-quality, handmade chocolates and sustainable, effective cacao farming and harvesting methods. Major corporations like Hershey\'s have expanded their artisanal chocolate lines by purchasing smaller producers known for premium chocolates, such as Scharffen Berger and Dagoba, while independent chocolatiers continue to flourish as well. ""I see more and more American artisans doing incredible things with chocolate,"" Leaf said. ""Although, I admit that I tend to look at the world through cocoa-tinted glasses.""'";"Other";"617.txt-Other"

"623.txt";"b'Is Chocolate Good for Your Heart?\n\nWhy a little, in moderation, may be beneficial\n\nChocolate has gotten a lot of media coverage in recent years because it\'s believed that it may help protect your cardiovascular system. The reasoning being that the cocoa bean is rich in a class of plant nutrients called flavonoids.\n\nFlavonoids help protect plants from environmental toxins and help repair damage. They can be found in a variety of foods, such as fruits and vegetables. When we eat foods rich in flavonoids, it appears that we also benefit from this ""antioxidant"" power.\n\nAntioxidants are believed to help the body\'s cells resist damage caused by free radicals that are formed by normal bodily processes, such as breathing, and from environmental contaminants, like cigarette smoke. If your body does not have enough antioxidants to combat the amount of oxidation that occurs, it can become damaged by free radicals. For example, an increase in oxidation can cause low-density lipoprotein (LDL), also known as ""bad"" cholesterol, to form plaque on the artery walls.\n\nFlavanols are the main type of flavonoid found in cocoa and chocolate. In addition to having antioxidant qualities, research shows that flavanols have other potential influences on vascular health, such as lowering blood pressure, improving blood flow to the brain and heart, and making blood platelets less sticky and able to clot.\n\nThese plant chemicals aren\xe2\x80\x99t only found in chocolate. In fact, a wide variety of foods and beverages are rich in flavonols. These include cranberries, apples, peanuts, onions, tea and red wine.\n\nAre all types of chocolate healthy?\n\nBefore you grab a chocolate candy bar or slice of chocolate cake, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand that not all forms of chocolate contain high levels of flavanols.\n\nCocoa naturally has a very strong, pungent taste, which comes from the flavanols. When cocoa is processed into your favorite chocolate products, it goes through several steps to reduce this taste. The more chocolate is processed (through things like fermentation, alkalizing, roasting, etc.), the more flavanols are lost.\n\nMost commercial chocolates are highly processed. Although it was once believed that dark chocolate contained the highest levels of flavanols, recent research indicates that, depending on how the dark chocolate was processed, this may not be true. The good news is that most major chocolate manufacturers are looking for ways to keep the flavanols in their processed chocolates. But for now, your best choices are likely dark chocolate over milk chocolate (especially milk chocolate that is loaded with other fats and sugars) and cocoa powder that has not undergone Dutch processing (cocoa that is treated with an alkali to neutralize its natural acidity).\n\nWhat about all of the fat in chocolate?\n\nYou may be surprised to learn that chocolate isn\xe2\x80\x99t as bad for you as once believed.\n\nThe fat in chocolate comes from cocoa butter and is made up of equal amounts of oleic acid (a heart-healthy monounsaturated fat also found in olive oil), stearic and palmitic acids. Stearic and palmitic acids are forms of saturated fat. You may know that saturated fats are linked to increases in LDL cholesterol and the risk of heart disease.\n\nBut, research shows that stearic acid appears to have a neutral effect on cholesterol, neither raising nor lowering it. Although palmitic acid does affect cholesterol levels, it only makes up one-third of the fat calories in chocolate. Still, this does not mean you can eat all the dark chocolate you\xe2\x80\x99d like.\n\nFirst, be careful about the type of dark chocolate you choose: chewy caramel-marshmallow-nut-covered dark chocolate is by no means a heart-healthy food option. Watch out for those extra ingredients that can add lots of extra fat and calories. Second, there is currently no established serving size of chocolate to help you reap the cardiovascular benefits it may offer, and more research is needed in this area. However, we do know that you no longer need to feel guilty if you enjoy a small piece of dark chocolate once in a while.\n\nSo, for now, enjoy moderate portions of chocolate (e.g., 1 ounce) a few times per week, and don\xe2\x80\x99t forget to eat other flavonoid-rich foods like apples, red wine, tea, onions and cranberries.'";"Other";"623.txt-Other"

"630.txt";"b""Originally consumed as a bitter drink, it was prized as both an aphrodisiac and an energy booster.\n\nMankind\xe2\x80\x99s love affair with chocolate stretches back more than five millennia. Produced from the seeds of tropical cacao trees native to the rainforests of Central and South America, chocolate was long considered the \xe2\x80\x9cfood of the gods,\xe2\x80\x9d and later, a delicacy for the elite. But for most of its history, it was actually consumed as a bitter beverage rather than the sweet, edible treat it has become worldwide.\n\nWhat Is the Birthplace of Chocolate?\n\nMayan cacao drink Ren Photo/Getty Images\n\nArchaeologists have discovered the earliest traces of cacao in pottery used by the ancient Mayo-Chinchipe culture 5,300 years ago in the upper Amazon region of Ecuador. Chocolate played an important political, spiritual and economic role in ancient Mesoamerican civilizations, which ground roasted cacao beans into a paste that they mixed with water, vanilla, chili peppers and other spices to brew a frothy chocolate drink.\n\nAncient Mesoamericans believed chocolate was an energy booster and aphrodisiac with mystical and medicinal qualities. The Mayans, who considered cacao a gift from the gods, used chocolate for sacred ceremonies and funeral offerings. Wealthy Mayans drank foaming chocolate drinks, while commoners consumed chocolate in a cold porridge-like dish.\n\nAs people of the Aztec empire spread across Mesoamerica in the 1400s, they too began to prize cacao. Since they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t grow it in the dry highlands of central Mexico, they traded with the Mayans for the beans, which they even used as currency. (In the 1500s, Aztecs could purchase a turkey hen or a hare for 100 beans.) By one account, the 16th-century Aztec ruler Moctezuma II drank 50 cups of chocolate a day out of a golden goblet to increase his libido.\n\nWATCH: Season 1 of The Food That Built America without signing in now.\n\nSpaniards Introduce Chocolate to Europe\xe2\x80\x99s Elite\n\nChocolate arrived in Europe during the 1500s, likely brought by both Spanish friars and conquistadors who had traveled to the Americas. Although the Spanish sweetened the bitter drink with cane sugar and cinnamon, one thing remained unchanged: Chocolate reigned as a delectable symbol of luxury, wealth and power\xe2\x80\x94an expensive import sipped by royal lips, and affordable only to Spanish elites.\n\nChocolate\xe2\x80\x99s popularity eventually spread to other European courts, where aristocrats consumed it as a magic elixir with health benefits. To slake their growing thirst for chocolate, European powers established colonial plantations in equatorial regions around the world to grow cacao and sugar. When diseases brought by Europeans depleted the native Mesoamerican labor pool, African slaves were imported to the Americas to work on the plantations and maintain chocolate production.\n\nChocolate remained an aristocratic nectar until the 1828 invention of the cocoa press revolutionized its production. Attributed in varying accounts to either Dutch chemist Coenraad Johannes van Houten or his father, Casparus, the cocoa press squeezed the fatty butter from roasted cacao beans, leaving behind a dry cake that could be pulverized into a fine powder that could be mixed with liquids and other ingredients, poured into molds and solidified into edible, easily digestible chocolate. The cocoa press ushered in the modern era of chocolate by enabling it to be used as a confectionary ingredient, and the resulting drop in production costs made chocolate much more affordable.\n\nREAD MORE: Why the Candy Bar Market Exploded After WWI\n\nChocolate Becomes a Treat for the Masses\n\n10 Gallery 10 Images\n\nIn 1847, British chocolate company J.S. Fry & Sons created the first edible chocolate bar from cocoa butter, cocoa powder and sugar. Rival chocolatier Cadbury\xe2\x80\x99s, credited with pioneering the Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day chocolate box and chocolate Easter egg, followed suit soon after and in 1854 earned a royal warrant as purveyors of chocolate to Queen Victoria.\n\nIt was in Switzerland that chocolate production took one of its greatest leaps forward. In the 1870s, Swiss chocolatier Daniel Peter utilized a powdered milk developed several years earlier by his neighbor Henri Nestl\xc3\xa9 to produce the first milk chocolate bar, and the pair eventually formed the Nestl\xc3\xa9 Company. Swiss chocolatier Rodolphe Lindt\xe2\x80\x99s 1879 invention of the conching machine\xe2\x80\x94which used large stone rollers to mix and aerate chocolate to give it a velvety texture and superior taste\xe2\x80\x94allowed for the mass production of smooth, creamy milk chocolate.\n\nIn the United States, Milton Hershey pioneered the assembly-line production of milk chocolate. After selling his caramel candy company for $1 million and producing his first milk chocolate bar in 1900, Hershey bought farmland near his birthplace in rural Pennsylvania and built an entire factory town devoted to chocolate. The grass-fed Holsteins on the surrounding dairy farms supplied the company\xe2\x80\x99s milk, and a company town in Cuba supplied its sugar.\n\nREAD MORE: How Hershey's Chocolate Helped Power Allied Troops in WWII\n\nChocolate bars soared in popularity during the Roaring Twenties.

Father-and-son duo Frank C. Mars and Forrest Mars Sr. collaborated on the idea for the Milky Way bar, which hit the market in 1923 with the chocolate for its coating supplied by Hershey\xe2\x80\x99s. The family-owned business would rival Hershey\xe2\x80\x99s, and Forrest Mars Sr. later partnered with the son of a Hershey\xe2\x80\x99s executive to begin production of M&M candies in 1941.\n\nH.B. Reese, who had worked as a dairy farmer and shipping foreman for Hershey\xe2\x80\x99s, launched his own candy company in 1923 and five years later introduced Reese\xe2\x80\x99s Peanut Butter Cups. They later came to be produced by Hershey\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94and one of the top-selling candies in the United States.\n\nFrom its roots more than 5,000 years ago, chocolate has become a big business. According to research by Statista, retail sales of chocolate worldwide in 2016 totaled nearly $100 billion, including almost $25 billion in the United States alone. While the cacao plant is native to the Americas, its cultivation has now shifted to Africa, which is now the source of more than two-thirds of worldwide cocoa production.\n\nWATCH: Full episodes of The Food That Built America online now.""";"Other";"630.txt-Other"

"658.txt";"b'Cocoa butter composition\n\nPrior to any refining, the fatty-acid composition of the CB used in this study was determined by gas-liquid chromatography. The CB used in this study is mainly composed of stearic acid (37.3%), palmitic acid (25.4%), and oleic acid (33.5%) (Supplementary Table 1), which closely matches typical literature values4. The phosphorus content of the unrefined CB is 88 \xc2\xb1 1 ppm, or 0.263 \xc2\xb1 0.004% equivalent phosphatides by weight (Supplementary Table 2), which is similar to the 0.34 \xc2\xb1 0.07% reported by Arruda and Dimick6. After refining, the phospholipids are completely removed from the CB. The FFA content of the unrefined CB is 1.65 \xc2\xb1 0.01% (as oleic acid) (Supplementary Table 3), which complies with the requirement of having <1.75% FFAs as oleic acid in Codex standards. This is reduced to 0.06% after neutralization and bleaching.\n\nCrystal structure and polymorphism\n\nPowder X-ray diffraction is the most unambiguous method for determining CB TAG polymorphism. In this study, CB samples were melted at 80 \xc2\xb0C for 30 min to clear the memory of crystallization and then crystallized statically at 23 \xc2\xb0C in an incubator for 1 day. Form IV displays wide-angle reflections corresponding to short spacings of 4.35, 4.15, 3.97, and 3.81 \xc3\x85, Form V has short spacings of 4.58, 3.98, 3.87, 3.75, and 3.67 \xc3\x85, while Form VI has short spacings of 4.59, 3.86, and 3.70 \xc3\x8510. Unrefined CB displays reflections corresponding to short spacings of 4.61, 3.88, and 3.71 \xc3\x85, which is characteristic of Form VI, matching literature values closely (Fig. 1; Supplementary Table 4)10. Additionally, the small-angle reflections corresponding to long spacings of 68.16 and 32.89 \xc3\x85 further suggest a Form VI polymorphism and a 3 L structure (polytype)11. CB TAGs in Forms V and VI stack as lamellae in the [001] direction with a dimension, which is proportional to three fatty-acid chain lengths, hence the nomenclature \xe2\x80\x9c3 L\xe2\x80\x9d. Other polymorphic forms stack as 2 L structures, the more common polytypic arrangement12.\n\nFig. 1: Powder X-ray diffraction patterns and differential scanning calorimetric traces (inset) of unrefined native CB, refined CB, and refined CB with added minor lipidic components. Samples included a unrefined native CB, b refined CB, c refined CB with added 0.1% (w/w) dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, and d refined CB with added 0.1% (w/w) dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine. Samples were crystallized statically at 23 \xc2\xb0C for 24 h. Full size image\n\nIn contrast, the refined CB sample displays a pattern that resembles a blend of Forms IV and V. Short spacings of 4.35 and 4.18 \xc3\x85 agree with literature values for Form IV, while 4.60, 3.99, 3.88, and 3.77 \xc3\x85 match those of Form V11. Furthermore, the long spacings include both 2 L (45.20 \xc3\x85) and 3 L (65.57 and 32.69 \xc3\x85) arrangements, indicative of the presence of Forms IV and V, respectively11. Thus, it appears that the removal of minor components in CB through refining drastically changes the crystal structure of CB.\n\nThe wide-angle region of powder XRD spectra of refined CB with minor components added back is generally characteristic of Form V, or a blend of Forms IV and V (Fig. 1c, d and Supplementary Fig. 1 (a\xe2\x80\x93f)). In the small-angle region, diffraction patterns suggest that the 3 L structure is present in all samples. Long spacings in the range 64\xe2\x80\x9368 \xc3\x85 correspond to the reflections of the (001) crystal plane. Higher-order reflections, up to ones corresponding to the (009) plane of this lamellar crystal, are also evident. However, there is also varying amounts of the 2 L structure present in the various samples, specifically Form IV, which imparts undesirable properties and stability to CB and chocolate, including a low melting point and excessive softness12. The DMPC, GMP, GMO, and FFA samples have little to no 2 L structure present, indicated by the lack of a (001) plane reflection corresponding to ~45 \xc3\x85. In contrast, DPPE and GMS CB samples display a strong 2 L reflection, suggesting a mixture of 2 L and 3 L structures.\n\nMelting point and enthalpy of fusion\n\nThe melting points and enthalpies of fusion determined by DSC were compared across the CB samples and are shown in Table 1. Example DSC curves are presented for each sample in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2. Wille and Lutton reported the melting temperatures for Forms I through VI as 17.3, 23.3. 25.5, 27.5, 33.9, and 36.3 \xc2\xb0C10, while Lovegren et al.13 reported lower melting temperatures for the same six polymorphs as 13, 20, 23, 25, 30, and 33.5 \xc2\xb0C. The melting point of the unrefined CB used in our study closely matches that of Form VI, as reported by Willie and Lutton10. However, once the CB is refined, the melting point drops to 28.8 \xc2\xb0C, indicative of Form IV. After adding specific minor components back into the refined CB, the melting temperature increases again. Phospholipid and MAG addition to refined CB yield samples with melting points in the range of 29.8\xe2\x80\x9332.2 \xc2\xb0C, suggesting that the CB crystals are in transition from Form IV to Form V, as reported by Wille and Lutton10. Finally, when FFAs are added to refined CB, the melting temperature increases back to about 34 \xc2\xb0C, which may indicate a mixture of Forms V and VI, as it is also similar to Form VI\xe2\x80\x99s melting point of 33.5 \xc2\xb0C13. These results are all in agreement with the XRD data.\n\nTable 1 Melting point and enthalpy of fusion of unrefined native CB, refined CB, and refined CB with added minor lipidic components. Full size table\n\nThe enthalpies of fusion follow a similar trend, with a higher enthalpy of fusion (143.9 J/g) for unrefined CB, which decreases significantly after refining (110.9 J/g). Again, the phospholipids and MAGs have a much smaller effect, if any, compared to the FFAs. With the FFA samples, the enthalpies of fusion are similar to that of the unrefined CB. Guthrie reported an enthalpy of 147 J/g for Form V CB, which decreased for less stable forms14.\n\nCrystallization kinetics\n\nThe crystallization kinetics of the CB samples were quantified using half-times derived from the Avrami model fitted to the SFC-temperature data, as shown in Fig. 2, with the calculated Avrami constants shown in Supplementary Table 515.\n\nFig. 2: Static crystallization growth curve of unrefined native CB, refined CB, and refined CB with added minor lipidic components crystallized at 23 \xc2\xb0C (symbols) and corresponding fits to the Avrami model (solid lines). The inset table indicates the half-times of crystallization derived form model fits. Refining CB accelerates its crystallization (a), as does 0.1% (w/w) phospholipid addition (b). Addition of 0.5% (w/w) saturated monoacylglycerols, glycerol monostearate, and glycerol monopalmitate, do not significantly affect crystallization kinetics, while addition of the unsaturated glycerol monooletate does (c). Free fatty-acid addition to refined CB at 0.5% (w/w) levels accelerates crystallization for stearic, palmitic, and oleic acids equally (d). Values represent means and standard errors of three replicates and values with the same superscript letter are not significantly different (P > 0.05). Full size image\n\nUnrefined CB has the longest half-time of crystallization at 281.9 min, which decreases to 202.3 min after refining. Statistically significant decreases (P < 0.05) in the half time of crystallization of unrefined CB are observed after addition of DMPC, DPPE, GMO, and all free fatty acids tested, including palmitic, stearic, and oleic acids. Chaiseri and Dimick reported that different phospholipids had different effects on crystallization rate, with certain phospholipids such as lysophosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol retarding nucleation, while others such as phosphatidylcholine promoting nucleation. They also highlighted that removing phospholipids through refining decreased the crystallization rate, indicating that phospholids may be necessary as initial crystallization seeds in CB1. This agrees with the data presented in this study, with the addition of phospholipids increasing crystallization rate. Arruda and Dimick reported a much higher relative concentration of phospholipids in seed crystals than in bulk CB, with the majority being phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine6. Thus, it appears that the added phospholipids may aid in the nucleation of CB TAGs.\n\nThe FFA and GMO CB samples have a slightly shorter half-time of crystallization relative to the refined CB sample, but the effects of palmitic and oleic acid are not statistically significant (P > 0.05). M\xc3\xbcller and Careglio focused their study specifically on FFAs, and reported slower crystal growth of unrefined CB with added stearic, palmitic, and oleic acids7. However, we do not observe this in our study. Chaiseri and Dimick reported that saturated free fatty acids increased the crystallization rate in the early stages of CB crystallization1.\n\nFew studies have been conducted on the effect of MAGs on CB crystallization. Chaiseri and Dimick suggested that their effects are small due to their low concentration in CB1. In our study, GMS and GMP, both saturated monoglycerides, do not significantly affect CB crystallization kinetics. Surprisingly, the unsaturated monoglyceride GMO enhances CB crystallization.\n\nPolarized light microscopy\n\nLight microscopy revealed subtle differences in the microstructure of the different CB samples (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 3). Although all images display feather-like spherulitic structures, the unrefined sample has smaller spherulites. DPPE addition, interestingly, leads to the formation of larger spherulites with a different texture than upon DMPC addition. The spherulites of the refined and DPPE samples display granular structures in the centre of the spherulites and feather-like crystallites in the periphery. The MAG samples all exhibit similar crystal morphologies, with both granular structures and small feather-like spherulites present. This is similar to the stearic and palmitic acid samples, though the FFA samples display a more granular structure. It appears that the MAG and FFA samples, excluding the oleic acid sample, revert the CB to the morphology of the unrefined sample. However, the oleic acid sample differs greatly from the rest, displaying large spherulites analogous to the refined CB sample.\n\nFig. 3: Polarized light microscopy images of unrefined native CB, refined CB, and refined CB with and without added minor lipidic components. Samples included a unrefined native CB, b refined CB, c refined CB with added 0.1% (w/w) dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, and d refined CB with added 0.1% (w/w) dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine. Samples were crystallized statically at 23 \xc2\xb0C for 24 h. Intensity and contrast were auto-levelled. Full size image\n\nAn aspect that became clear during the microscopy studies is that the spatial distribution of mass of CB is affected by the refining process and subsequent addition of minor lipidic components. One way to quantify this spatial distribution of mass is by determining the box-counting fractal dimension (D box ) of the images. A high fractal dimension is associated with a greater fill of the available embedding space with crystalline mass, as well as a higher order in the distribution of this crystalline mass. The box-counting fractal dimension provides a value that quantifies the level of space-filling, as well as self-similarity within a structure, which can be related to the nucleation process of CB. Supplementary Table 6 lists these values. The unrefined and stearic acid samples have the lowest average fractal dimension, with D box = 1.63 and 1.62, respectively. In contrast, the sample with the highest fractal dimension is the refined sample at D box = 1.75, followed by the phospholipid samples at ~1.72. Samples with a higher fractal dimension are expected to have originated from a higher nucleation rate, as this leads to more homogenous growth across an area. On the other hand, slower nucleation rates would result in more heterogeneous growth, leading to a lower fractal dimension for the resulting mass distribution 16.\n\nInterestingly, here we also discovered a statistically significant (r = 0.77, P < 0.01) inverse correlation between the melting temperature of the samples and their fractal dimension, as shown in Fig. 4. This may be related to the polymorphism of each sample and its corresponding nucleation process. For the unrefined sample, a high melting temperature of 36.4 \xc2\xb0C indicates the presence of the Form VI polymorph. The higher free energy of nucleation for this most stable polymorph results in low nucleation rates, leading to a more heterogeneous mass distribution and a lower fractal dimension. Conversely, the lower melting temperature of the refined sample suggests a mixture of Forms IV and V, which are metastable polymorphs. These polymorphic forms have greater rates of nucleation, resulting in a more homogeneous mass distribution and a higher fractal dimension16.\n\nFig. 4: Global relationship between the box-counting fractal dimension (D box ) of polarized light microscopy images of CB samples and their corresponding melting temperature (T m ). Fractal dimension values plotted represent the means of six images, while melting temperature values plotted represent the means of three replicates. Full size image\n\nMechanical properties\n\nThe hardness of both CB and chocolate samples containing some of the minor components was determined by 3-point bending, and the elastic bending modulus calculated. The elastic bending moduli (E B ) of unrefined CB, refined CB, and DMPC CB are 44.1 \xc2\xb1 3.4, 35.4 \xc2\xb1 4.4, and 39.0 \xc2\xb1 3.7 N/mm2, respectively. There is no statistically significant difference between these values (P > 0.05). The melting temperatures for these samples are the same as well, with the average being 34.3 \xc2\xb1 0.1 \xc2\xb0C.\n\nFor the chocolate samples, the addition of phospholipids to molten commercial chocolate (90% cocoa solids) allows the chocolate to maintain hardness without complex tempering procedures, such as crystallization at 5 \xc2\xb0C for 1 h and subsequent storage at 20 \xc2\xb0C for 4 days. Other trials with static crystallization at 23 and 26 \xc2\xb0C yield chocolates with undesirable mechanical and surface properties, suggesting that the use of phospholipids to promote proper tempering still requires some optimization of crystallization temperatures. DMPC and DPPE were added chocolate at 0.1% (w/w) levels, and their properties were compared to commercial chocolate both directly from the package and recrystallized under the same conditions as the doped samples (Table 2). The E B is similar between the commercial chocolate and the phospholipid-containing samples, but is significantly lower for the recrystallized commercial chocolate (P < 0.05). When the chocolate is melted and recrystallized without any additive addition, it becomes much softer. A greater E B indicates a stiffer chocolate, relating to the property of snap, which is desirable in chocolate. However, DSC analysis revealed that all the chocolate samples have similar melting temperatures, all indicative of Form V CB crystals. XRD patterns further confirm the presence of Form V CB crystals in all samples (Fig. 5). Thus, it appears that the polymorphism of CB in chocolate does not wholly determine its mechanical properties, and these mechanical properties may be attributed to the microstructure instead.\n\nTable 2 Elastic bending modulus (E B ), melting temperature, and whiteness index (WI) of commercial chocolate samples with added phospholipids. Full size table\n\nFig. 5: Powder X-ray diffraction patterns for commercial chocolate with added minor lipidic components. Chocolate samples were molten, blended with the minor components and crystallized at 5 \xc2\xb0C for 1 h, followed by 20 \xc2\xb0C for 4 days. The a commercial chocolate, b molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate, c molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added 0.1% (w/w) dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, and d molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added 0.1% (w/w) dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine, all display powder X-ray diffraction patterns characteristic of well-tempered \xce\xb2 2 , triclinic, Form V cocoa butter crystals. This crystal form displays a strong reflection corresponding to a short spacing of ~4.6 \xc3\x85 in the wide-angle diffraction region, and characteristic wide-angle reflections in the 2\xce\xb8 region 20\xe2\x80\x9325\xc2\xb0. In the small-angle diffraction region, only reflections from the 3 L (001) plane corresponding to ~62\xe2\x80\x9363-\xc3\x85 were observed. The absence of reflections from (001) plane of the 2 L polytype indicates the formation of the optimal polytypic form in the cocoa butter in all samples. Reflections at higher angles in the small-angle region correspond to higher-order reflections for these two crystal planes. Full size image\n\nProper chocolate tempering typically focuses on the melting behavior of the chocolate, in other words, the polymorphism of the chocolate\xe2\x80\x99s CB triacylglycerol crystals2,3. However, there is little consideration for the microstructure and mechanical properties when determining whether chocolate has been properly tempered or not. Here we show that addition of DMPC and DPPE helps achieve the desired hardness and fracture properties in chocolate, without directly impacting the polymorphism. This likely results from changes in the microstructure of the underlying CB fat crystal network, which arises from the phospholipids affecting the nucleation behavior of the CB.\n\nSurface reflectance\n\nProper tempering of chocolate results in a smooth surface with high surface gloss17. Bloom, for example, is often characterized by the appearance of a grayish white film on the surface of chocolate, attributed to the uncontrolled polymorphic transformation from Form V to Form VI18. This white appearance is due to the presence of large surface crystals, which scatter light impinging upon them19. This can be quantified using the Whiteness Index (WI), calculated from RGB surface color measurements17. A higher WI indicates a greater level of fat bloom on the surface of the chocolate, or may also indicate a rougher surface. The WI for each of the chocolate samples is shown in Table 2. The commercial chocolate and the DMPC chocolate sample have similar WI, suggesting a properly tempered chocolate for the DMPC sample. Moreover, a statistically significant difference is evident between the DMPC chocolate sample and the recrystallized commercial chocolate sample (P < 0.05), which was not tempered properly. The lower WI of the DMPC chocolate sample suggests that the addition of this phospholipid aided in the stability of the chocolate, resulting in less fat bloom and/or a smoother surface compared to the recrystallized commercial chocolate sample. The effect of DPPE addition to molten and recrystallized chocolate is not as clear since the WI is not statistically different from the commercial, DMPC or molten and recrystallized chocolates.\n\nChocolate microstructure by synchrotron-based micro-computed tomography (SR-\xc2\xb5CT)\n\nSynchrotron \xc2\xb5CT analysis revealed similarities between chocolate microstructure among all samples imaged at a <450 \xc2\xb5m length scale. CT voxel intensity is directly proportional to material density. The number of voxels with a given intensity is then representative of the number of volume fractions with a given density in the analyzed volume. The molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate sample (Lindt-R) displays the largest difference between samples, with a narrowing and shift of the histogram compared to the fresh commercial chocolate (Lindt-F), molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added DMPC, and molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added DPPE. This indicates a difference in material structure upon recrystallization. This is visually represented in volume renderings where the most notable difference is a reduction in the green intensity for Lindt-R, compared to the Lindt-F, DMPC, and DPPE samples, as seen in Fig. 6. Volume rendering movies of each sample can be seen in the corresponding links in Fig. 6.\n\nFig. 6: Volume renderings of reconstructed slices, plotted histograms, and correlation matrix of SR-\xc2\xb5CT data. Samples included a molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added 0.1% (w/w) dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC), Supplementary Movie 1; b molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added 0.1% (w/w) dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DPPE), Supplementary Movie 2; c fresh commercial chocolate (Lindt-F), Supplementary Movie 3; d molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate (Lindt-R), Supplementary Movie 4; e plotted histograms, and f correlation matrix. Full size image\n\nA comparison of the histograms shows qualitative differences in the overall density distributions, which make up the sample volumes in the images. A correlation matrix was generated by inputting the voxel count values for each binned 16-bit gray-value and generating a table of correlation coefficients between the four chocolates density distributions. The correlation matrices show a high positive correlation in the material\xe2\x80\x99s density distribution regardless of treatment; however, the least variance is observed between DMPC vs. Lindt-F and DPPE vs. Lindt-F. The highest correlation coefficient is found between DMPC and fresh Lindt, and DPPE vs. fresh Lindt samples, with a value of 0.9987. This suggests that the complex microstructure of Lindt chocolate with added DMPC and DPPE and crystallized isothermally, is more similar to that of tempered fresh Lindt chocolate than without these additives.\n\nOverall, we find that the presence of various minor components within CB results in major changes to its polymorphism, crystallization kinetics, and crystal morphology. By refining CB through neutralization and bleaching, the unrefined CB transitioned from Form VI to a blend of Forms IV and V, in addition to displaying faster crystal growth. Although adding MAGs and FFAs back into refined CB results in some small differences, phospholipid addition has the largest impact.\n\nAt 0.1% (w/w) levels, DMPC and DPPE both significantly increase the crystal growth rate of refined CB. However, the DPPE sample exhibits significant amounts of the 2 L polytype, while the DMPC sample only displays 3 L polytypism, which is the more stable and preferred nanostructure. When added to a commercial chocolate sample, DMPC and DPPE both template the Form V polymorph with optimal mechanical properties, surface gloss and microstructure. This may allow for the production of chocolate products without the need for laborious and complex tempering protocols.\n\nProper tempering is often judged by the resulting melting temperature, a function of the CB polymorphic form2. However, as we show in this study, the various chocolate samples were all in Form V as determined by DSC and XRD analysis, but display different mechanical properties. This suggests that there is more to tempering than achieving the Form V polymorph, and important qualities such as gloss and snap may be heavily dependent on surface and bulk microstructure. Thus, DMPC, DPPE, and possibly other saturated phospholipids can potentially be employed as effective additives for engineering the crystallization behavior, polymorphism, nanostructure, and microstructure in CB and chocolate products.'";"Other";"658.txt-Other"
"66.txt";"b'Is chocolate toxic to dogs?\n\nYes, chocolate is toxic to dogs. While rarely fatal, chocolate ingestion can result in significant illness. Chocolate is toxic because it contains a chemical called theobromine, as well as caffeine. Theobromine is the main toxin in chocolate and is very similar to caffeine. Both chemicals are used medicinally as a diuretic, heart stimulant, blood vessel dilator, and a smooth muscle relaxant. Dogs cannot metabolize theobromine and caffeine as well as people can. That is why dogs are more sensitive to the chemicals\xe2\x80\x99 effects.\n\nHow much chocolate is poisonous to a dog?\n\nThe amount of toxic theobromine varies with the type of chocolate. The darker and more bitter the chocolate, the more dangerous it is to dogs. Baking chocolate and gourmet dark chocolate are highly concentrated and contain 130-450 mg of theobromine per ounce. Common milk chocolate only contains about 44-58 mg/ounce. White chocolate rarely poses any threat of chocolate poisoning with only 0.25 mg of theobromine per ounce of chocolate. Even if the amount ingested is not a toxicity concern, dogs can still become ill from the fat and sugar in chocolate. These can cause pancreatitis in severe cases or in dogs that have more sensitive stomachs. To put this in perspective, a medium-sized dog weighing 50 pounds would only need to eat 1 ounce of baker\'s chocolate, or 9 ounces of milk chocolate, to potentially show signs of poisoning. For many dogs, ingesting small amounts of milk chocolate is not harmful.\n\nWhat are the clinical signs of chocolate poisoning?\n\nClinical signs depend on the amount and type of chocolate ingested. For many dogs, the most common clinical signs are vomiting, diarrhea, increased thirst, panting or restlessness, excessive urination, and racing heart rate.

"689.txt";"b'Chocolate is toxic to dogs, and depending on the type and amount of chocolate consumed and the weight of your dog, it could cause a serious medical emergency. If you know your dog has eaten chocolate, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to monitor him for signs of toxicity (see below), and it\xe2\x80\x99s recommended that you contact your veterinarian or the Pet Poison Helpline (855-213-6680, fee applies) for advice.\n\nLearn how much is too much, which types of chocolate are the most dangerous, and what signs to look for that may signal your dog needs treatment.\n\nWhy Chocolate Is Toxic to Dogs\n\nChocolate contains both theobromine and caffeine, both of which can speed the heart rate and stimulate the nervous system of dogs, the Merck/Merial Manual for Veterinary Health explains. The risk of your dog becoming sick from ingesting chocolate depends on the type and amount of chocolate consumed and the weight of the dog (calculate your dog\xe2\x80\x99s risk of toxicity with this easy-to-use program). The concentrations of these toxic substances vary among different types of chocolates. Here are a few types of chocolate listed in order of theobromine content:\n\nCocoa powder (most toxic) Unsweetened baker\xe2\x80\x99s chocolate Semisweet chocolate Dark chocolate Milk chocolate\n\nKnowing how much and what kind of chocolate your dog ate can help you and your vet determine if you have an emergency. In general, mild symptoms of chocolate toxicity occur when a dog consumes 20 mg of methylxanthines per kilogram of body weight. Cardiac symptoms of chocolate toxicity occur around 40 to 50 mg/kg, and seizures occur at dosages greater than 60 mg/kg.\n\nIn simpler terms, that means a very concerning dose of chocolate is approximately one ounce of milk chocolate per pound of body weight. Since an average Hershey\xe2\x80\x99s Milk Chocolate bar is 1.55 ounces, consuming even one chocolate bar can have serious consequences, especially for small dogs. Eating a crumb of chocolate cake or a very small piece of a chocolate bar, on the other hand, probably won\xe2\x80\x99t kill your dog, especially if it is a larger breed, but chocolate should never be fed as a treat.\n\nWhat are the Signs of Chocolate Poisoning?\n\nSigns of chocolate poisoning usually appear within 6 to 12 hours after your dog has eaten it, may last up to 72 hours, and include the following:\n\nVomiting\n\nDiarrhea\n\nRestlessness\n\nIncreased urination\n\nTremors\n\nElevated or abnormal heart rate\n\nSeizures\n\nCollapse and death\n\nNote: Older dogs and dogs with heart conditions are more at risk of sudden death from chocolate poisoning.\n\nWhat to Do If Your Dog Ate Chocolate\n\nIf you believe your dog ate chocolate, call your veterinarian immediately or call the Pet Poison Helpline (855-213-6680) for advice. Based on your dog\xe2\x80\x99s size and the amount and type of chocolate consumed, your veterinarian may recommend that you monitor your dog for the clinical signs listed above and call back if his condition worsens.\n\nIn other cases, the veterinarian may prefer you bring the dog into the clinic. If your pet consumed the chocolate less than two hours ago, your veterinarian may induce vomiting and give him several doses of activated charcoal, which works to move the toxins out of the body without being absorbed into the bloodstream. For more severe cases, veterinary intervention may be needed to provide supplemental treatment, such as medications or IV fluids, to resolve the effects of the poisoning. Dogs suffering from seizures may need to be monitored at the clinic overnight.\n\nHow to Prevent Your Dog from Eating Chocolate\n\nEven though small amounts of milk chocolate may not cause a problem in larger dogs, it\xe2\x80\x99s still not recommended that pet owners offer their dog chocolate as a treat. To prevent your dog from sneaking chocolate, follow these tips:\n\nPut it away: Make sure all chocolate items, including cocoa powder and hot chocolate mix, are stored where the dog cannot reach them, such as on a high shelf in a closed-door pantry. Remind your children and guests that chocolate should be kept out of the dog\xe2\x80\x99s reach and not left on countertops, tables, or in purses. Keep this in mind during the holidays, too, making sure to place trick-or-treat bags, Easter baskets, Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day candy, Christmas stockings, and Hanukkah coins (gelt), for example, in a place where a dog cannot get to them.\n\nTeach \xe2\x80\x9cleave it\xe2\x80\x9d: The command \xe2\x80\x9cleave it\xe2\x80\x9d is extremely effective in preventing dogs from eating something that falls onto the ground or is left within reach during a walk. It\xe2\x80\x99s also a very easy command to teach.\n\nCrate train your dog: The safest way to ensure your dog doesn\xe2\x80\x99t eat anything harmful while you\xe2\x80\x99re not supervising him is to crate train him. Find a sturdy crate that is large enough for your dog to stand up and turn around and make it a comfortable, safe place for him to retreat to when he wants to be alone or when you can\xe2\x80\x99t watch him.

Small variations in the quality of ingredients, temperature, mixing and timing can all set you up to fail, even when you learn from the best.\n\nThe results of a new study by food scientists from the University of Guelph in Canada suggest the addition of two common, naturally occurring fats \xe2\x80\x93 in the right proportions \xe2\x80\x93 might make chocolate tempering less of a gamble.\n\nPick up just about any block of milk chocolate from your local store, and you'll find it's more or less made out of the same things \xe2\x80\x93 cocoa butter for the form, cocoa mass (or chocolate liquor) for that familiar bitter taste, and additives like sugar or vanilla for sweetness and flavor.\n\nCrafting a solid bar of chocolate is a matter of encouraging the right size and distribution of crystals. In chocolate, crystalline forms of cocoa butter triglycerides (TAGs) are what give the food its characteristic shine, smooth texture, brittleness, and melting point.\n\nNot just any crystalline structure will do, either. Of the six distinct configurations of this class of molecule known to exist, Form V is the one that gives us a perfect temper.\n\nTempering \xe2\x80\x93 transforming the diverse mix of molecules into something that resists your bite while feeling heavenly smooth on your tongue \xe2\x80\x93 is a culinary process that has been gradually perfected over time, relying on a fine-tuned sequence of heating, mixing, and cooling.\n\nWhile researchers have investigated the influence TAG composition has on the success of tempering, little is known about how minor components of cocoa butter might make or break the process, including things like free fatty acids and phospholipids.\n\nGiven they make up just a few percent of the chemicals in cocoa butter, differences in their origins and refining might significantly alter the make-up of this key ingredient, either by helping the right crystals generate or interfering with their growth.\n\nPrevious research hinted at roles certain minor components had in the formation of the 'seed' crystals. For example, having a lot of free fatty acids seems to poison the crystallization process. Phospholipids, on the other hand, appeared to help them grow.\n\nTo nail down the precise proportions and chemical nature of these components, the researchers analyzed the exact make-up of a sample of cocoa butter, varying its composition by adding ingredients or bleaching out existing ones.\n\nThey then subjected it to a variety of tests to determine how variations in fat content might affect the growth time and proportion of crystal types, as well as things like melting point, surface reflection, micro-structure, and flex.\n\nWhile the amount of molecules such as free fatty acids had some effect, the real game-changer was the proportion of phospholipids, specifically saturated phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. Don't let the tongue-twister names fool you, though: these are garden variety biological molecules found in the membranes of living cells.\n\nBoth of these molecules in higher concentrations saw to the formation of Form V crystals, giving the cocoa butter the optimal glass, micro-structure, and mechanical properties.\n\nAdding the right amount of each to chocolate just might take the anxiety out of the tempering process, either by simplifying it or even eliminating it altogether.\n\nThis won't necessarily turn all of us into home kitchen dessertiers. But for professionals relying on recipes they can count on, knowing a little more about the chemistry of their chocolate creations just might give them the formula they need.\n\nThis research was published in Nature Communications.""";"Other";"693.txt-Other"

I had been wanting something sweet and since it was so hot outside, I decided I wanted ice cream. At the store, I saw the talenti pints of gelato and thought, ""how cute, I can reuse these."" I chose the coffee chocolate chip and I\'m so glad I did. It is creamy, has a full coffee flavor, and the chips are so thin and small they just melt away. I normally dislike chips in my frozen treats, but like I said, these just melted away nicely.

And the texture is perfect ~ a bit more solid then the other chocolate chip flavors especially in contrast to the Mediterranean Mint, Chocolate Chip, Peppermint Bark, etc ~ although all yummy, they melt far to quickly for my taste as I enjoy savoring the experience!! True, I pretty much love just about all the Talenti flavors and eat 1/2 a pint every night for my treat. But Talenti\'s Coffee Chocolate Chip has become one of my favorite flavors!\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by Auditory from This is what coffee flavor is all about In the mid-1960s when I was just a tot, my Sisters used to take me to a little shack that doubled as an ice cream parlor. The place featured a big name ice cream brand that is still one of the major players today. That\'s where I had my first taste of a coffee flavored frozen confection. Regrettably, the band name product today tastes nothing like I remembered it to have been. Fortunately, Talenti gelato has made that memory come back to life. With every spoonful, there is no guessing where the flavor is. Talenti has crafted a frozen dessert with an uncompromisingly strong coffee flavor that punches the tastebuds every time.\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by Kath12 from Delicious! My favorite ice cream flavor since I was young was Mocha. That flavor has disappeared. One night my daughter brought over brownies with a complimentary Talenti flavor. I fell in love with this gelato. Next time I went shopping I decided to buy the coffee with the chocolate chips. The first spoonful brought back the flavor I had longer for. It is now my nightly treat. All I need is 2-3 tablespoons full and I am totally satisfied until the next night. Sometimes I will mix it with one of your vanilla flavors & it is so yummy! No longer am I searching for this delicious flavor. I am totally hooked on Talenti brand gelato. I have enjoyed every flavor so far & I still have many more to try.\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by Baddie13 from Great Ice Cream This ice cream is delicious and is a great blend. I can taste the coffee and chocolate chips great together.\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by Mina from My life is now complete I was having a miserable day and I saw this in the store. Not much of a coffee person unless it\'s loaded with chocolate. Tried this as one of those what-the-hey-I\'ll-give-it-a-try moments and that first taste? [Insert angels singing here] DE-LOVIN-LICIOUS!!! The perfect amount of coffee taste, a ton of chocolate chips so no spoonful is left wanting, and my day got infinitely better after I downed half the jar in five minutes. Perfection in a jar. My only problem is trying to make it last before I can buy more! Yum yum yummy yummy yum! :D\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by best one so far from Best one so far Previous flavors I tried were super hard to open because they spilled gelato on the edge, making it extremely difficult to open. These were finally clean so it was easy to open. That was the first major PLUS in my book. Then I tried the gelato and was so impressed. It\'s the best coffee flavor I\'ve ever tasted. It\'s bolder than any other coffee flavored brands I\'ve tried so far. Normally I don\'t like ""stuff"" in my ice cream/gelato, but the ""chips"" in this one is more like shavings so it\'s not as noticeable (unlike their Double Dark Chocolate gelato which has chucks of chips). Best flavor so far from Talenti.'";"Other";"694.txt-Other"

Kudos, for those who never had the pleasure, were a kind of granola-candy bar hybrid made by Mars that debuted in the late \xe2\x80\x9980s. Comprising a granola bar topped by a peanut butter layer pebbled with crispy rice, the whole thing enrobed in waxy chocolate, those slim bars fueled my adolescence.\n\nSo maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s no wonder that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been craving the combination of peanut butter and chocolate as I prepare to send my own children back to school \xe2\x80\x94 real, in-person, full-time school \xe2\x80\x94 for the first time in a long time. Kudos have been long since discontinued, but the appeal of a bar made with good peanut butter and excellent chocolate has not gone out of style among children or their mothers, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to report.\n\nThough these bars are inspired by Kudos, they\xe2\x80\x99re not intended to be a replica. I took some liberties: Instead of a granola bar, I make my version with a simple shortbread crust that\xe2\x80\x99s pressed into the pan with your fingertips; it\xe2\x80\x99s sturdy enough to give the bar structure, but with a tender crumb and an irresistible brown butter flavor. I top the crust with a second layer made from a combination of melted natural peanut butter and milk chocolate into which I stir puffed rice (or, if you prefer, Rice Krispies).\n\nI prefer natural smooth peanut butter for almost everything, these bars included \xe2\x80\x94 the milk chocolate gives the mixture plenty of sweetness, and I like its slightly coarse texture; if you want even more texture, use crunchy peanut butter. Almond butter can also be substituted. The bars are finished with a silky layer of dark chocolate, its bitterness acting as a foil for the sweet peanut butter layer. A dusting of finely chopped peanuts adds another textural element.\n\nI cut the bars into squat, skinny bars. While small, they are mighty, rich and intense.

"701.txt";"b'Food produced from the seed of Theobroma cacao\n\nChocolate is a food product made from roasted and ground cacao pods, that is available as a liquid, solid or paste, on its own or as a flavoring agent in other foods. Cacao has been consumed in some form since at least the Olmec civilization (19th-11th century BCE),[1][2] and the majority of Mesoamerican people - including the Maya and Aztecs - made chocolate beverages.[3]\n\nThe seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor. After fermentation, the beans are dried, cleaned, and roasted. The shell is removed to produce cocoa nibs, which are then ground to cocoa mass, unadulterated chocolate in rough form. Once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating, it is called chocolate liquor. The liquor may also be cooled and processed into its two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter. Baking chocolate, also called bitter chocolate, contains cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions, without any added sugar. Powdered baking cocoa, which contains more fiber than cocoa butter, can be processed with alkali to produce dutch cocoa. Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, a combination of cocoa solids, cocoa butter or added vegetable oils, and sugar. Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder or condensed milk. White chocolate contains cocoa butter, sugar, and milk, but no cocoa solids.\n\nChocolate is one of the most popular food types and flavors in the world, and many foodstuffs involving chocolate exist, particularly desserts, including cakes, pudding, mousse, chocolate brownies, and chocolate chip cookies. Many candies are filled with or coated with sweetened chocolate. Chocolate bars, either made of solid chocolate or other ingredients coated in chocolate, are eaten as snacks. Gifts of chocolate molded into different shapes (such as eggs, hearts, coins) are traditional on certain Western holidays, including Christmas, Easter, Valentine\'s Day, and Hanukkah. Chocolate is also used in cold and hot beverages, such as chocolate milk and hot chocolate, and in some alcoholic drinks, such as creme de cacao.\n\nAlthough cocoa originated in the Americas, West African countries, particularly C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire and Ghana, are the leading producers of cocoa in the 21st century, accounting for some 60% of the world cocoa supply.\n\nWith some two million children involved in the farming of cocoa in West Africa, child slavery and trafficking were major concerns in 2018,[4][5] and continue to be. International attempts to improve conditions for children were doomed to failure because of persistent poverty, absence of schools, increasing world cocoa demand, more intensive farming of cocoa, and continued exploitation of child labor.[4]\n\nHistory\n\nMesoamerican usage\n\nTwo Mayans sit around a container of frothed chocolate.\n\nChocolate has been prepared as a drink for nearly all of its history. For example, one vessel found at an Olmec archaeological site on the Gulf Coast of Veracruz, Mexico, dates chocolate\'s preparation by pre-Olmec peoples as early as 1750 BC.[6] On the Pacific coast of Chiapas, Mexico, a Mokaya archaeological site provides evidence of cocoa beverages dating even earlier, to 1900 BC.[7][6] The residues and the kind of vessel in which they were found indicate the initial use of cocoa was not simply as a beverage, but the white pulp around the cocoa beans was likely used as a source of fermentable sugars for an alcoholic drink.[8]\n\nMan Carrying a Cacao Pod, 1440\xe2\x80\x931521. Volcanic stone, traces of red pigment. Aztec., 1440\xe2\x80\x931521. Volcanic stone, traces of red pigment. Brooklyn Museum\n\nAn early Classic-period (460\xe2\x80\x93480 AD) Mayan tomb from the site in Rio Azul had vessels with the Maya glyph for cocoa on them with residue of a chocolate drink, suggests the Maya were drinking chocolate around 400 AD.[9] Documents in Maya hieroglyphs stated chocolate was used for ceremonial purposes, in addition to everyday life.[10] The Maya grew cacao trees in their backyards,[11] and used the cocoa seeds the trees produced to make a frothy, bitter drink.[12]\n\nBy the 15th century, the Aztecs gained control of a large part of Mesoamerica and adopted cocoa into their culture. They associated chocolate with Quetzalcoatl, who, according to one legend, was cast away by the other gods for sharing chocolate with humans,[13] and identified its extrication from the pod with the removal of the human heart in sacrifice.[14] In contrast to the Maya, who liked their chocolate warm, the Aztecs drank it cold, seasoning it with a broad variety of additives, including the petals of the Cymbopetalum penduliflorum tree, chile pepper, allspice, vanilla, and honey.\n\nThe Aztecs were unable to grow cocoa themselves, as their home in the Mexican highlands was unsuitable for it, so chocolate was a luxury imported into the empire.[13] Those who lived in areas ruled by the Aztecs were required to offer cocoa seeds in payment of the tax they deemed ""tribute"".[13] Cocoa beans were often used as currency.[15] For example, the Aztecs used a system in which one turkey cost 100 cocoa beans and one fresh avocado was worth three beans.[16]\n\nThe Maya and Aztecs associated cocoa with human sacrifice, and chocolate drinks specifically with sacrificial human blood. The Spanish royal chronicler Gonzalo Fern\xc3\xa1ndez de Oviedo y Vald\xc3\xa9s described a chocolate drink he had seen in Nicaragua in 1528, mixed with achiote: ""because those people are fond of drinking human blood, to make this beverage seem like blood, they add a little achiote, so that it then turns red. ... and part of that foam is left on the lips and around the mouth, and when it is red for having achiote, it seems a horrific thing, because it seems like blood itself.""\n\nEuropean adaptation\n\nThe morning chocolate by Chocolate soon became a fashionable drink of the European nobility after the discovery of the Americas.by Pietro Longhi ; Venice, 1775\xe2\x80\x931780\n\nUntil the 16th century, no European had ever heard of the popular drink from the Central American peoples.[13] Christopher Columbus and his son Ferdinand encountered the cocoa bean on Columbus\'s fourth mission to the Americas on 15 August 1502, when he and his crew seized a large native canoe that proved to contain cocoa beans among other goods for trade.[19] Spanish conquistador Hern\xc3\xa1n Cort\xc3\xa9s may have been the first European to encounter it, as the frothy drink was part of the after-dinner routine of Montezuma.[9][20] Jos\xc3\xa9 de Acosta, a Spanish Jesuit missionary who lived in Peru and then Mexico in the later 16th century, wrote of its growing influence on the Spaniards:\n\nAlthough bananas are more profitable, cocoa is more highly esteemed in Mexico. . . Cocoa is a smaller fruit than almonds and thicker, which toasted do not taste bad. It is so prized among the Indians and even among Spaniards. . . because since it is a dried fruit it can be stored for a long time without deterioration, and they brings ships loaded with them from the province of Guatemala. . . It also serves as currency, because with five cocoas you can buy one thing, with thirty another, and with a hundred something else, without there being contradiction; and they give these cocoas as alms to the poor who beg for them. The principal product of this cocoa is a concoction which they make that they call \xe2\x80\x9cchocolate,\xe2\x80\x9d which is a crazy thing treasured in that land, and those who are not accustomed are disgusted by it, because it has a foam on top and a bubbling like that of feces, which certainly takes a lot to put up with. Anyway, it is the prized beverage which the Indians offer to nobles who come to or pass through their lands; and the Spaniards, especially Spanish women born in those lands die for black chocolate. This aforementioned chocolate is said to the be made in various forms and temperaments, hot, cold, and lukewarm. They are wont to use spices and much chili; they also make it into a paste, and it is said that it is a medicine to treat coughs, the stomach, and colds. Whatever may be the case, in fact those who have not been reared on this opinion are not appetized by it.[21]\n\n""Trait\xc3\xa9s nouveaux & curieux du caf\xc3\xa9 du th\xc3\xa9 et du chocolate"", by Philippe Sylvestre Dufour, 1685 , by Philippe Sylvestre Dufour, 1685\n\nWhile Columbus had taken cocoa beans with him back to Spain,[19] chocolate made no impact until Spanish friars introduced it to the Spanish court.[13] After the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs, chocolate was imported to Europe. There, it quickly became a court favorite. It was still served as a beverage, but the Spanish added sugar, as well as honey (the original sweetener used by the Aztecs for chocolate), to counteract the natural bitterness.[22] Vanilla, another indigenous American introduction, was also a popular additive, with pepper and other spices sometimes used to give the illusion of a more potent vanilla flavor. Unfortunately, these spices tended to unsettle the European constitution; the Encyclop\xc3\xa9die states, ""The pleasant scent and sublime taste it imparts to chocolate have made it highly recommended; but a long experience having shown that it could potentially upset one\'s stomach"", which is why chocolate without vanilla was sometimes referred to as ""healthy chocolate"".[23] By 1602, chocolate had made its way from Spain to Austria.[24] By 1662, Pope Alexander VII had declared that religious fasts were not broken by consuming chocolate drinks. Within about a hundred years, chocolate established a foothold throughout Europe.[13]\n\nmoulinet or swizzle stick, London 1714\xe2\x80\x9315 ( Silver chocolate pot with hinged finial to insert aor swizzle stick, London 1714\xe2\x80\x9315 ( Victoria and Albert Museum\n\nThe new craze for chocolate brought with it a thriving slave market, as between the early 1600s and late 1800s, the laborious and slow processing of the cocoa bean was manual.[13] Cocoa plantations spread, as the English, Dutch, and French colonized and planted. With the depletion of Mesoamerican workers, largely to disease, cocoa production was often the work of poor wage laborers and African slaves. Wind-powered and horse-drawn mills were used to speed production, augmenting human labor. Heating the working areas of the table-mill, an innovation that emerged in France in 1732, also assisted in extraction.[25]\n\nNew processes that sped the production of chocolate emerged early in the Industrial Revolution. In 1815, Dutch chemist Coenraad van Houten introduced alkaline salts to chocolate, which reduced its bitterness.[13] A few years thereafter, in 1828, he created a press to remove about half the natural fat (cocoa butter or cocoa butter) from chocolate liquor, which made chocolate both cheaper to produce and more consistent in quality. This innovation introduced the modern era of chocolate.[19]\n\nKnown as ""Dutch cocoa"", this machine-pressed chocolate was instrumental in the transformation of chocolate to its solid form when, in 1847, English chocolatier Joseph Fry discovered a way to make chocolate moldable when he mixed the ingredients of cocoa powder and sugar with melted cocoa butter.[22] Subsequently, his chocolate factory, Fry\'s of Bristol, England, began mass-producing chocolate bars, Fry\'s Chocolate Cream, launched in 1866, and they became very popular.[26] Milk had sometimes been used as an addition to chocolate beverages since the mid-17th century, but in 1875 Swiss chocolatier Daniel Peter invented milk chocolate by mixing a powdered milk developed by Henri Nestl\xc3\xa9 with the liquor.[13][19] In 1879, the texture and taste of chocolate was further improved when Rudolphe Lindt invented the conching machine.[27]\n\nBesides Nestl\xc3\xa9, several notable chocolate companies had their start in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Rowntree\'s of York set up and began producing chocolate in 1862, after buying out the Tuke family business. Cadbury was manufacturing boxed chocolates in England by 1868.[13] Manufacturing their first Easter egg in 1875, Cadbury created the modern chocolate Easter egg after developing a pure cocoa butter that could easily be molded into smooth shapes.[28] In 1893, Milton S. Hershey purchased chocolate processing equipment at the World\'s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, and soon began the career of Hershey\'s chocolates with chocolate-coated caramels.\n\nIntroduction to the United States\n\nThe Baker Chocolate Company, which makes Baker\'s Chocolate, is the oldest producer of chocolate in the United States. In 1765 Dr. James Baker and John Hannon founded the company in Boston. Using cocoa beans from the West Indies, the pair built their chocolate business, which is still in operation.[29][30]\n\nWhite chocolate was first introduced to the U.S. in 1946 by Frederick E. Hebert of Hebert Candies in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, near Boston, after he had tasted ""white coat"" candies while traveling in Europe.[31][30]\n\nEtymology\n\nCocoa, pronounced by the Olmecs as kakawa,[1] dates to 1000 BC or earlier.[1] The word ""chocolate"" entered the English language from Spanish in about 1600.[32] The word entered Spanish from the word chocol\xc4\x81tl in Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs. The origin of the Nahuatl word is uncertain, as it does not appear in any early Nahuatl source, where the word for chocolate drink is cacahuatl, ""cocoa water"". It is possible that the Spaniards coined the word (perhaps in order to avoid caca, a vulgar Spanish word for ""faeces"") by combining the Yucatec Mayan word chocol, ""hot"", with the Nahuatl word atl, ""water"". A widely-cited proposal is that the derives from unattested xocolatl meaning ""bitter drink"" is unsupported; the change from x- to ch- is unexplained, as is the -l-. Another proposed etymology derives it from the word chicolatl, meaning ""beaten drink"", which may derive from the word for the frothing stick, chicoli.[34] Other scholars reject all these proposals, considering the origin of first element of the name to be unknown.[35] The term ""chocolatier"", for a chocolate confection maker, is attested from 1888.[36]\n\nTypes\n\nChocolate is commonly used as a coating for various fruits such as cherries and/or fillings, such as liqueurs\n\nSeveral types of chocolate can be distinguished. Pure, unsweetened chocolate, often called ""baking chocolate"", contains primarily cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions. Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, which combines chocolate with sugar.\n\nMilk\n\nMilk chocolate is sweet chocolate that also contains milk powder or condensed milk. In the UK and Ireland, milk chocolate must contain a minimum of 20% total dry cocoa solids; in the rest of the European Union, the minimum is 25%.[37]\n\nWhite\n\nWhite chocolate\n\nWhite chocolate, although similar in texture to that of milk and dark chocolate, does not contain any cocoa solids that impart a dark color. In 2002, the US Food and Drug Administration established a standard for white chocolate as the ""common or usual name of products made from cocoa fat (i.e., cocoa butter), milk solids, nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners, and other safe and suitable ingredients, but containing no nonfat cocoa solids"".[38]\n\nDark\n\nDark chocolate is produced by adding fat and sugar to the cocoa mixture. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration calls this ""sweet chocolate"", and requires a 15% concentration of chocolate liquor. European rules specify a minimum of 35% cocoa solids.[37] A higher amount of cocoa solids indicates more bitterness. Semisweet chocolate is dark chocolate with low sugar content. Bittersweet chocolate is chocolate liquor to which some sugar (typically a third), more cocoa butter and vanilla are added.[39] It has less sugar and more liquor than semisweet chocolate, but the two are interchangeable in baking. It is also known to last for two years if stored properly. As of 2017 , there is no high-quality evidence that dark chocolate affects blood pressure significantly or provides other health benefits.[40]\n\nUnsweetened\n\nUnsweetened chocolate is pure chocolate liquor, also known as bitter or baking chocolate. It is unadulterated chocolate: the pure, ground, roasted chocolate beans impart a strong, deep chocolate flavor. It is typically used in baking or other products to which sugar and other ingredients are added. Raw chocolate, often referred to as raw cocoa, is always dark and a minimum of 75% cocoa.\n\nUnsweetened ""Baking"" Chocolate\n\nPoorly tempered or untempered chocolate may have whitish spots on the dark chocolate part, called chocolate bloom; it is an indication that sugar or fat has separated due to poor storage. It is not toxic and can be safely consumed.[41]\n\nProduction\n\nChocolate is created from the cocoa bean. A cacao tree with fruit pods in various stages of ripening.\n\nRoughly two-thirds of the entire world\'s cocoa is produced in West Africa, with 43% sourced from C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire,[42] where, as of 2007 , child labor is a common practice to obtain the product.[43][44] According to the World Cocoa Foundation, in 2007 some 50 million people around the world depended on cocoa as a source of livelihood.[45] As of 2007 in the UK, most chocolatiers purchase their chocolate from them, to melt, mold and package to their own design.[46] According to the WCF\'s 2012 report, the Ivory Coast is the largest producer of cocoa in the world.[47] The two main jobs associated with creating chocolate candy are chocolate makers and chocolatiers. Chocolate makers use harvested cocoa beans and other ingredients to produce couverture chocolate (covering). Chocolatiers use the finished couverture to make chocolate candies (bars, truffles, etc.).[48]\n\nProduction costs can be decreased by reducing cocoa solids content or by substituting cocoa butter with another fat. Cocoa growers object to allowing the resulting food to be called ""chocolate"", due to the risk of lower demand for their crops.[45]\n\nGenome\n\nThe sequencing in 2010 of the genome of the cacao tree may allow yields to be improved.[49] Due to concerns about global warming effects on lowland climate in the narrow band of latitudes where cocoa is grown (20 degrees north and south of the equator), the commercial company Mars, Incorporated and the University of California, Berkeley are conducting genomic research in 2017\xe2\x80\x9318 to improve the survivability of cacao plants in hot climates.[50]\n\nCacao varieties\n\nChocolate is made from cocoa beans, the dried and fermented seeds of the cacao tree (Theobroma cacao), a small, 4\xe2\x80\x938 m tall (15\xe2\x80\x9326 ft tall) evergreen tree native to the deep tropical region of the Americas. Recent genetic studies suggest the most common genotype of the plant originated in the Amazon basin and was gradually transported by humans throughout South and Central America. Early forms of another genotype have also been found in what is now Venezuela. The scientific name, Theobroma, means ""food of the gods"".[51] The fruit, called a cocoa pod, is ovoid, 15\xe2\x80\x9330 cm (6\xe2\x80\x9312 in) long and 8\xe2\x80\x9310 cm (3\xe2\x80\x934 in) wide, ripening yellow to orange, and weighing about 500 g (1.1 lb) when ripe.\n\nCacao trees are small, understory trees that need rich, well-drained soils. They naturally grow within 20\xc2\xb0 of either side of the equator because they need about 2000 mm of rainfall a year, and temperatures in the range of 21 to 32 \xc2\xb0C (70 to 90 \xc2\xb0F). Cacao trees cannot tolerate a temperature lower than 15 \xc2\xb0C (59 \xc2\xb0F).[52]\n\nThe three main varieties of cocoa beans used in chocolate are criollo, forastero, and trinitario.\n\nCriollo\n\nRepresenting only 5% of all cocoa beans grown as of 2008 ,[53] criollo is the rarest and most expensive cocoa on the market, and is native to Central America, the Caribbean islands and the northern tier of South American states.[54] The genetic purity of cocoas sold today as criollo is disputed, as most populations have been exposed to the genetic influence of other varieties.\n\nCriollos are particularly difficult to grow, as they are vulnerable to a variety of environmental threats and produce low yields of cocoa per tree. The flavor of criollo is described as delicate yet complex, low in classic chocolate flavor, but rich in ""secondary"" notes of long duration.[55]\n\nForastero\n\nThe most commonly grown bean is forastero,[53] a large group of wild and cultivated cocoas, most likely native to the Amazon basin. The African cocoa crop is entirely made up of forastero. They are significantly hardier and of higher yield than criollo. The source of most chocolate marketed,[53] forastero cocoas are typically strong in classic ""chocolate"" flavor, but have a short duration and are unsupported by secondary flavors, producing ""quite bland"" chocolate.[53]\n\nTrinitario\n\nTrinitario is a natural hybrid of criollo and forastero. Trinitario originated in Trinidad after an introduction of forastero to the local criollo crop. Nearly all cocoa produced over the past five decades is of the forastero or lower-grade trinitario varieties.[56]\n\nProcessing\n\nCocoa pods are harvested by cutting them from the tree using a machete, or by knocking them off the tree using a stick. The beans with their surrounding pulp are removed from the pods and placed in piles or bins, allowing access to micro-organisms so fermentation of the pectin-containing material can begin. Yeasts produce ethanol, lactic acid bacteria produce lactic acid, and acetic acid bacteria produce acetic acid. The fermentation process, which takes up to seven days, also produces several flavor precursors, eventually resulting in the familiar chocolate taste.[57]\n\nIt is important to harvest the pods when they are fully ripe, because if the pod is unripe, the beans will have a low cocoa butter content, or sugars in the white pulp will be insufficient for fermentation, resulting in a weak flavor. After fermentation, the beans must be quickly dried to prevent mold growth. Climate and weather permitting, this is done by spreading the beans out in the sun from five to seven days.[58]\n\nThe dried beans are then transported to a chocolate manufacturing facility. The beans are cleaned (removing twigs, stones, and other debris), roasted, and graded. Next, the shell of each bean is removed to extract the nib. Finally, the nibs are ground and liquefied, resulting in pure chocolate in fluid form: chocolate liquor.[59] The liquor can be further processed into two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter.[60]\n\nBlending\n\nChocolate liquor is blended with the cocoa butter in varying quantities to make different types of chocolate or couverture. The basic blends of ingredients for the various types of chocolate (in order of highest quantity of cocoa liquor first), are:\n\nFountain chocolate is made with high levels of cocoa butter, allowing it to flow gently over a chocolate fountain to serve as dessert fondue\n\nDark chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa liquor, and (sometimes) vanilla\n\nMilk chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa liquor, milk or milk powder, and vanilla\n\nWhite chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, milk or milk powder, and vanilla\n\nUsually, an emulsifying agent, such as soy lecithin, is added, though a few manufacturers prefer to exclude this ingredient for purity reasons and to remain GMO-free, sometimes at the cost of a perfectly smooth texture. Some manufacturers are now using PGPR, an artificial emulsifier derived from castor oil that allows them to reduce the amount of cocoa butter while maintaining the same mouthfeel.\n\nThe texture is also heavily influenced by processing, specifically conching (see below). The more expensive chocolate tends to be processed longer and thus has a smoother texture and mouthfeel, regardless of whether emulsifying agents are added.\n\nDifferent manufacturers develop their own ""signature"" blends based on the above formulas, but varying proportions of the different constituents are used. The finest, plain dark chocolate couverture contains at least 70% cocoa (both solids and butter), whereas milk chocolate usually contains up to 50%. High-quality white chocolate couverture contains only about 35% cocoa butter.\n\nProducers of high-quality, small-batch chocolate argue that mass production produces bad-quality chocolate.[53] Some mass-produced chocolate contains much less cocoa (as low as 7% in many cases), and fats other than cocoa butter. Vegetable oils and artificial vanilla flavor are often used in cheaper chocolate to mask poorly fermented and/or roasted beans.[53]\n\nIn 2007, the Chocolate Manufacturers Association in the United States, whose members include Hershey, Nestl\xc3\xa9, and Archer Daniels Midland, lobbied the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to change the legal definition of chocolate to let them substitute partially hydrogenated vegetable oils for cocoa butter, in addition to using artificial sweeteners and milk substitutes.[61] Currently, the FDA does not allow a product to be referred to as ""chocolate"" if the product contains any of these ingredients.[62][63]\n\nIn the EU a product can be sold as chocolate if it contains up to 5% vegetable oil, and must be labeled as ""family milk chocolate"" rather than ""milk chocolate"" if it contains 20% milk.[64]\n\nAccording to Canadian Food and Drug Regulations,[65] a ""chocolate product"" is a food product that is sourced from at least one ""cocoa product"" and contains at least one of the following: ""chocolate, bittersweet chocolate, semi-sweet chocolate, dark chocolate, sweet chocolate, milk chocolate, or white chocolate"". A ""cocoa product"" is defined as a food product that is sourced from cocoa beans and contains ""cocoa nibs, cocoa liquor, cocoa mass, unsweetened chocolate, bitter chocolate, chocolate liquor, cocoa, low-fat cocoa, cocoa powder, or low-fat cocoa powder"".\n\nConching\n\nChocolate melanger mixing raw ingredients\n\nThe penultimate process is called conching. A conche is a container filled with metal beads, which act as grinders. The refined and blended chocolate mass is kept in a liquid state by frictional heat. Chocolate before conching has an uneven and gritty texture. The conching process produces cocoa and sugar particles smaller than the tongue can detect (typically around 20 \xce\xbcm) and reduces rough edges, hence the smooth feel in the mouth. The length of the conching process determines the final smoothness and quality of the chocolate. High-quality chocolate is conched for about 72 hours, and lesser grades about four to six hours. After the process is complete, the chocolate mass is stored in tanks heated to about 45 to 50 \xc2\xb0C (113 to 122 \xc2\xb0F) until final processing.[66]\n\nTempering\n\nVideo of cocoa beans being ground and mixed with other ingredients to make chocolate at a Mayordomo store in Oaxaca\n\nThe final process is called tempering. Uncontrolled crystallization of cocoa butter typically results in crystals of varying size, some or all large enough to be seen with the naked eye. This causes the surface of the chocolate to appear mottled and matte, and causes the chocolate to crumble rather than snap when broken.[67][68] The uniform sheen and crisp bite of properly processed chocolate are the results of consistently small cocoa butter crystals produced by the tempering process.\n\nThe fats in cocoa butter can crystallize in six different forms (polymorphous crystallization).[67][69] The primary purpose of tempering is to assure that only the best form is present. The six different crystal forms have different properties.\n\nCrystal Melting temp. Notes I 17 \xc2\xb0C (63 \xc2\xb0F) Soft, crumbly, melts too easily II 21 \xc2\xb0C (70 \xc2\xb0F) Soft, crumbly, melts too easily III 26 \xc2\xb0C (79 \xc2\xb0F) Firm, poor snap, melts too easily IV 28 \xc2\xb0C (82 \xc2\xb0F) Firm, good snap, melts too easily V 34 \xc2\xb0C (93 \xc2\xb0F) Glossy, firm, best snap, melts near body temperature (37 \xc2\xb0C) VI 36 \xc2\xb0C (97 \xc2\xb0F) Hard, takes weeks to form\n\nMolten chocolate and a piece of a chocolate bar\n\nAs a solid piece of chocolate, the cocoa butter fat particles are in a crystalline rigid structure that gives the chocolate its solid appearance. Once heated, the crystals of the polymorphic cocoa butter can break apart from the rigid structure and allow the chocolate to obtain a more fluid consistency as the temperature increases \xe2\x80\x93 the melting process. When the heat is removed, the cocoa butter crystals become rigid again and come closer together, allowing the chocolate to solidify.[70]\n\nThe temperature in which the crystals obtain enough energy to break apart from their rigid conformation would depend on the milk fat content in the chocolate and the shape of the fat molecules, as well as the form of the cocoa butterfat. Chocolate with a higher fat content will melt at a lower temperature.[71]\n\nMaking chocolate considered ""good"" is about forming as many type V crystals as possible. This provides the best appearance and texture and creates the most stable crystals, so the texture and appearance will not degrade over time. To accomplish this, the temperature is carefully manipulated during the crystallization.\n\npistoles and callets Chocolate cubes,and\n\nGenerally, the chocolate is first heated to 45 \xc2\xb0C (113 \xc2\xb0F) to melt all six forms of crystals.[67][69] Next, the chocolate is cooled to about 27 \xc2\xb0C (81 \xc2\xb0F), which will allow crystal types IV and V to form. At this temperature, the chocolate is agitated to create many small crystal ""seeds"" which will serve as nuclei to create small crystals in the chocolate. The chocolate is then heated to about 31 \xc2\xb0C (88 \xc2\xb0F) to eliminate any type IV crystals, leaving just type V. After this point, any excessive heating of the chocolate will destroy the temper and this process will have to be repeated. Other methods of chocolate tempering are used as well. The most common variant is introducing already tempered, solid ""seed"" chocolate. The temper of chocolate can be measured with a chocolate temper meter to ensure accuracy and consistency. A sample cup is filled with the chocolate and placed in the unit which then displays or prints the results.\n\nTwo classic ways of manually tempering chocolate are:\n\nWorking the molten chocolate on a heat-absorbing surface, such as a stone slab, until thickening indicates the presence of sufficient crystal ""seeds""; the chocolate is then gently warmed to working temperature.\n\nStirring solid chocolate into molten chocolate to ""inoculate"" the liquid chocolate with crystals (this method uses the already formed crystals of the solid chocolate to ""seed"" the molten chocolate).\n\nChocolate tempering machines (or temperers) with computer controls can be used for producing consistently tempered chocolate. In particular, continuous tempering machines are used in large volume applications. Various methods and apparatuses for continuous flow tempering have been described by Aasted, Sollich and Buhler, three manufacturers of commercial chocolate equipment, with a focus now on energy efficiency. In general, molten chocolate coming in at 40\xe2\x80\x9350 \xc2\xb0C is cooled in heat exchangers to crystallization temperates of about 26\xe2\x80\x9330 \xc2\xb0C, passed through a tempering column consisting of spinning plates to induce shear, then warmed slightly to re-melt undesirable crystal formations.[72][73]\n\nShaping\n\nChocolate is molded in different shapes for different uses:[74]\n\nChocolate bars (tablets) are rectangular blocks of chocolate meant to be broken down to cubes (or other predefined shapes), which can then be used for consumption, cooking and baking. The term is also used for combination bars, which are a type of candy bars\n\nChocolate chips are small pieces of chocolate, usually drop-like, which are meant for decoration and baking\n\nPistoles , callets and f\xc3\xa8ves are small, coin-like or bean-like pieces of chocolate meant for baking and patisserie applications (also see Pistole (coin) and F\xc3\xa8ve (trinket))\n\n, and are small, coin-like or bean-like pieces of chocolate meant for baking and patisserie applications (also see Pistole (coin) and F\xc3\xa8ve (trinket)) Chocolate blocks are large, cuboid chunks of chocolate meant for professional use and further processing\n\nOther, more specialized shapes for chocolate include sticks, curls and hollow semi-spheres\n\nStorage\n\nChocolate is very sensitive to temperature and humidity. Ideal storage temperatures are between 15 and 17 \xc2\xb0C (59 and 63 \xc2\xb0F), with a relative humidity of less than 50%. If refrigerated or frozen without containment, chocolate can absorb enough moisture to cause a whitish discoloration, the result of fat or sugar crystals rising to the surface. Various types of ""blooming"" effects can occur if chocolate is stored or served improperly.[75]\n\nChocolate bloom is caused by storage temperature fluctuating or exceeding 24 \xc2\xb0C (75 \xc2\xb0F), while sugar bloom is caused by temperature below 15 \xc2\xb0C (59 \xc2\xb0F) or excess humidity. To distinguish between different types of bloom, one can rub the surface of the chocolate lightly, and if the bloom disappears, it is fat bloom. Moving chocolate between temperature extremes, can result in an oily texture. Although visually unappealing, chocolate suffering from bloom is safe for consumption and taste unaffected.[76][77][78] Bloom can be reversed by retempering the chocolate or using it for any use that requires melting the chocolate.[79]\n\nChocolate is generally stored away from other foods, as it can absorb different aromas. Ideally, chocolates are packed or wrapped, and placed in proper storage with the correct humidity and temperature. Additionally, chocolate is frequently stored in a dark place or protected from light by wrapping paper. The glossy shine, snap, aroma, texture, and taste of the chocolate can show the quality and if it was stored well.[80]\n\nComposition\n\nNutrition\n\nA 100-gram serving of milk chocolate supplies 540 calories. It is 59% carbohydrates (52% as sugar and 3% as dietary fiber), 30% fat and 8% protein (table). Approximately 65% of the fat in milk chocolate is saturated, mainly palmitic acid and stearic acid, while the predominant unsaturated fat is oleic acid (table).\n\n100-grams of milk chocolate is an excellent source (over 19% of the Daily Value, DV) of riboflavin, vitamin B12 and the dietary minerals, manganese, phosphorus and zinc. Chocolate is a good source (10\xe2\x80\x9319% DV) of calcium, magnesium and iron.\n\nEffects on health\n\nChocolate may be a factor for heartburn in some people because one of its constituents, theobromine, may affect the esophageal sphincter muscle in a way that permits stomach acids to enter the esophagus.[81] Theobromine poisoning is an overdosage reaction to the bitter alkaloid, which happens more frequently in domestic animals than humans. However, daily intake of 50\xe2\x80\x93100 g cocoa (0.8\xe2\x80\x931.5 g theobromine) by humans has been associated with sweating, trembling and severe headache.[82] Chocolate contains alkaloids such as theobromine and phenethylamine, which have physiological effects in humans, but the presence of theobromine renders it toxic to some animals, including dogs and cats.[83]\n\nAccording to a 2005 study, the average lead concentration of cocoa beans is \xe2\x89\xa4 0.5 ng/g, which is one of the lowest reported values for a natural food.[84] However, during cultivation and production, chocolate may absorb lead from the environment (such as in atmospheric emissions of leaded gasoline, which is still being used in Nigeria).[84] Reports from 2014 indicate that ""chocolate might be a significant source"" of lead ingestion for children if consumption is high (with dark chocolate containing higher amounts),[85][86] and ""one 10 g cube of dark chocolate may contain as much as 20% of the daily lead oral limit.""[85]\n\nChocolate and cocoa contain moderate to high amounts of oxalate,[87][88] which may increase the risk of kidney stones.[89]\n\nA few studies have documented allergic reactions from chocolate in children.[81] Other research has shown that dark chocolate can aggravate acne in men who are prone to it.[90] Research has also shown that consuming dark chocolate does not substantially affect blood pressure.[40] Chocolate and cocoa are under preliminary research to determine if consumption affects the risk of certain cardiovascular diseases[91] or cognitive abilities.[92]\n\nOne tablespoonful (5 grams) of dry unsweetened cocoa powder has 12.1 mg of caffeine[93] and a 25-g single serving of dark chocolate has 22.4 mg of caffeine.[94] Although a single 7 oz. serving of coffee may contain 80\xe2\x80\x93175 mg,[95] studies have shown psychoactive effects in caffeine doses as low as 9 mg,[96] and a dose as low as 12.5 mg was shown to have effects on cognitive performance.[97]\n\nExcessive consumption of large quantities of any energy-rich food, such as chocolate, without a corresponding increase in activity to expend the associated calories, can cause weight gain and possibly lead to obesity.[81] Raw chocolate is high in cocoa butter, a fat which is removed during chocolate refining and then added back in varying proportions during the manufacturing process. Manufacturers may add other fats, sugars, and milk, all of which increase the caloric content of chocolate.[81]\n\nPhytochemicals\n\nIn comparison to most foods, cocoa contains more phenolic antioxidants.[98] Cocoa solids are a source of flavonoids[99] and alkaloids, such as theobromine, phenethylamine, and caffeine.[100]\n\nLabeling\n\nSome manufacturers provide the percentage of chocolate in a finished chocolate confection as a label quoting percentage of ""cocoa"" or ""cacao"". This refers to the combined percentage of both cocoa solids and cocoa butter in the bar, not just the percentage of cocoa solids.[101] The Belgian AMBAO certification mark indicates that no non-cocoa vegetable fats have been used in making the chocolate.[102][103] A long-standing dispute between Britain on the one hand and Belgium and France over British use of vegetable fats in chocolate ended in 2000 with the adoption of new standards which permitted the use of up to five percent vegetable fats in clearly labelled products.[104] This British style of chocolate has sometimes been pejoratively referred to as ""vegelate"".[104]\n\nChocolates that are organic[105] or fair trade certified[106] carry labels accordingly.\n\nIn the United States, some large chocolate manufacturers lobbied the federal government to permit confections containing cheaper hydrogenated vegetable oil in place of cocoa butter to be sold as ""chocolate"". In June 2007, in response to consumer concern about the proposal, the FDA reiterated ""Cacao fat, as one of the signature characteristics of the product, will remain a principal component of standardized chocolate.""[107]\n\nIndustry\n\nChocolate, prevalent throughout the world, is a steadily growing, US$50 billion-a-year worldwide business.[108] Europe accounts for 45% of the world\'s chocolate revenue,[109] and the US spent $20 billion in 2013.[110] Big Chocolate is the grouping of major international chocolate companies in Europe and the U.S. U.S. companies Mars and Hershey\'s alone generated $13 billion a year in chocolate sales and account for two-thirds of U.S. production in 2004.[111] Despite the expanding reach of the chocolate industry internationally, cocoa farmers and labourers in the Ivory Coast are unaware of the uses of the beans; the high cost of chocolate products in the Ivory Coast make it inaccessible to the majority of the population, who do not know what it tastes like.[112]\n\nManufacturers\n\nChocolate with various fillings\n\nChocolate manufacturers produce a range of products from chocolate bars to fudge. Large manufacturers of chocolate products include Cadbury (the world\'s largest confectionery manufacturer), Ferrero, Guylian, The Hershey Company, Lindt & Spr\xc3\xbcngli, Mars, Incorporated, Milka, Neuhaus and Suchard.\n\nGuylian is best known for its chocolate sea shells; Cadbury for its Dairy Milk and Creme Egg. The Hershey Company, the largest chocolate manufacturer in North America, produces the Hershey Bar and Hershey\'s Kisses.[113] Mars Incorporated, a large privately owned U.S. corporation, produces Mars Bar, Milky Way, M&M\'s, Twix, and Snickers. Lindt is known for its truffle balls and gold foil-wrapped Easter bunnies.\n\nFood conglomerates Nestl\xc3\xa9 SA and Kraft Foods both have chocolate brands. Nestl\xc3\xa9 acquired Rowntree\'s in 1988 and now markets chocolates under their brand, including Smarties (a chocolate candy) and Kit Kat (a chocolate bar); Kraft Foods through its 1990 acquisition of Jacobs Suchard, now owns Milka and Suchard. In February 2010, Kraft also acquired British-based Cadbury;[114] Fry\'s, Trebor Basset and the fair trade brand Green & Black\'s also belongs to the group.\n\nChild labor in cocoa harvesting\n\nThe widespread use of children in cocoa production is controversial, not only for the concerns about child labor and exploitation, but also because up to 12,000 of the 200,000 children working in C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire, the world\'s biggest producer of cocoa,[115] may be victims of trafficking or slavery.[116] Most attention on this subject has focused on West Africa, which collectively supplies 69 percent of the world\'s cocoa, and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire in particular, which supplies 35 percent of the world\'s cocoa. Thirty percent of children under age 15 in sub-Saharan Africa are child laborers, mostly in agricultural activities including cocoa farming.[118] Major chocolate producers, such as Nestl\xc3\xa9, buy cocoa at commodities exchanges where Ivorian cocoa is mixed with other cocoa.[119]\n\nIn 2009, Salvation Army International Development (SAID) UK stated that 12,000 children have been trafficked on cocoa farms in the Ivory Coast of Africa, where half of the world\'s chocolate is made.[120] SAID UK states that it is these child slaves who are likely to be working in ""harsh and abusive""[121] conditions for the production of chocolate,[120] and an increasing number of health-food[122] and anti-slavery[123] organisations are highlighting and campaigning against the use of trafficking in the chocolate industry.\n\nAs of 2017, approximately 2.1 million children in Ghana and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire were involved in farming cocoa, carrying heavy loads, clearing forests, and being exposed to pesticides.[5] According to Sona Ebai, the former secretary-general of the Alliance of Cocoa Producing Countries: ""I think child labor cannot be just the responsibility of industry to solve. I think it\'s the proverbial all-hands-on-deck: government, civil society, the private sector. And there, you need leadership.""[116] Reported in 2018, a 3-year pilot program \xe2\x80\x93 conducted by Nestl\xc3\xa9 with 26,000 farmers mostly located in C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire \xe2\x80\x93 observed a 51% decrease in the number of children doing hazardous jobs in cocoa farming.[4] The US Department of Labor formed the Child Labor Cocoa Coordinating Group as a public-private partnership with the governments of Ghana and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire to address child labor practices in the cocoa industry.[124] The International Cocoa Initiative involving major cocoa manufacturers established the Child Labor Monitoring and Remediation System intended to monitor thousands of farms in Ghana and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire for child labor conditions,[4][5] but the program reached less than 20% of the child laborers.[125] Despite these efforts, goals to reduce child labor in West Africa by 70% before 2020 are frustrated by persistent poverty, absence of schools, expansion of cocoa farmland, and increased demand for cocoa.[4][126]\n\nIn April 2018, the Cocoa Barometer report stated: ""Not a single company or government is anywhere near reaching the sector-wide objective of the elimination of child labor, and not even near their commitments of a 70% reduction of child labor by 2020"".[126]\n\nFair trade\n\nIn the 2000s, some chocolate producers began to engage in fair trade initiatives, to address concerns about the marginalization of cocoa laborers in developing countries. Traditionally, Africa and other developing countries received low prices for their exported commodities such as cocoa, which caused poverty to abound. Fairtrade seeks to establish a system of direct trade from developing countries to counteract this unfair system.[127] One solution for fair labor practices is for farmers to become part of an Agricultural cooperative. Cooperatives pay farmers a fair price for their cocoa so farmers have enough money for food, clothes, and school fees.[128] One of the main tenets of fair trade is that farmers receive a fair price, but this does not mean that the larger amount of money paid for fair trade cocoa goes directly to the farmers. The effectiveness of fair trade has been questioned. In a 2014 article, The Economist stated that workers on fair trade farms have a lower standard of living than on similar farms outside the fair trade system.[129]\n\nUsage and consumption\n\ns\'more topped with melted chocolate from a chocolate bar\n\nChocolate cake with chocolate frosting\n\nBars\n\nChocolate is sold in chocolate bars, which come in dark chocolate, milk chocolate and white chocolate varieties. Some bars that are mostly chocolate have other ingredients blended into the chocolate, such as nuts, raisins, or crisped rice. Chocolate is used as an ingredient in a huge variety of bars, which typically contain various confectionary ingredients (e.g., nougat, wafers, caramel, nuts, etc.) which are coated in chocolate.\n\nCoating and filling\n\nChocolate is used as a flavouring product in many desserts, such as chocolate cakes, chocolate brownies, chocolate mousse and chocolate chip cookies. Numerous types of candy and snacks contain chocolate, either as a filling (e.g., M&M\'s) or as a coating (e.g., chocolate-coated raisins or chocolate-coated peanuts).\n\nBeverages\n\nSome non-alcoholic beverages contain chocolate, such as chocolate milk, hot chocolate, chocolate milkshakes and tejate. Some alcoholic liqueurs are flavoured with chocolate, such as chocolate liqueur and creme de cacao.

"702.txt";"b'But what effect does eating chocolate have on our health?\n\nChocolate has since become a popular food product that millions enjoy every day, thanks to its unique, rich, and sweet taste.\n\nAfter the European discovery of the Americas, chocolate became very popular in the wider world, and its demand exploded.\n\nChocolate is made from tropical Theobroma cacao tree seeds. Its earliest use dates back to the Olmec civilization in Mesoamerica.\n\nThe next time you eat a piece of chocolate, you may not have to feel so guilty about it. Despite its bad reputation for causing weight gain, a number of health benefits may be associated with this delicious treat.\n\nShare on Pinterest Recent research suggests that chocolate may have some health benefits.\n\nChocolate receives a lot of bad press because of its high fat and sugar content. Its consumption has been associated with acne, obesity, high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, and diabetes.\n\nHowever, according to a review of chocolate\xe2\x80\x99s health effects published in the Netherlands Journal of Medicine, it\xe2\x80\x99s not all bad news.\n\nThe authors point to the discovery that cocoa, the key ingredient in chocolate, contains biologically active phenolic compounds.\n\nThis has changed people\xe2\x80\x99s views on chocolate, and it has stimulated research into how it might impact aging, and conditions such as oxidative stress, blood pressure regulation, and atherosclerosis.\n\nChocolate\xe2\x80\x99s antioxidant potential may have a range of health benefits. The higher the cocoa content, as in dark chocolate, the more benefits there are. Dark chocolate may also contain less fat and sugar, but it is important to check the label.\n\nEating chocolate may have the following benefits:\n\nlowering cholesterol levels\n\npreventing cognitive decline\n\nreducing the risk of cardiovascular problems\n\nIt is important to note that the possible health benefits mentioned below came from single studies. More research is needed to confirm that eating chocolate can really improve people\xe2\x80\x99s health.\n\nIn addition, chocolate bars do not contain only cocoa. The benefits and risks of any other ingredients, such as sugar and fat, need to be considered.\n\n1) Cholesterol\n\nOne study, published in The Journal of Nutrition, suggests that chocolate consumption might help reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, also known as \xe2\x80\x9cbad cholesterol.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe researchers set out to investigate whether chocolate bars containing plant sterols (PS) and cocoa flavanols (CF) have any effect on cholesterol levels.\n\nThe authors concluded: \xe2\x80\x9cRegular consumption of chocolate bars containing PS and CF, as part of a low-fat diet, may support cardiovascular health by lowering cholesterol and improving blood pressure.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n2) Cognitive function\n\nScientists at Harvard Medical School have suggested that drinking two cups of hot chocolate a day could help keep the brain healthy and reduce memory decline in older people.\n\nThe researchers found that hot chocolate helped improve blood flow to parts of the brain where it was needed.\n\nLead author, Farzaneh A. Sorond, said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs different areas of the brain need more energy to complete their tasks, they also need greater blood flow. This relationship, called neurovascular coupling, may play an important role in diseases such as Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nResults of a lab experiment, published in 2014, indicated that a cocoa extract, called lavado, might reduce or prevent damage to nerve pathways found in patients with Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s disease. This extract could help slow symptoms such as cognitive decline.\n\nAnother study, published in 2016 in the journal Appetite, suggests eating chocolate at least once weekly could improve cognitive function.\n\n3) Heart disease\n\nResearch published in The BMJ, suggests that consuming chocolate could help lower the risk of developing heart disease by one-third .\n\nBased on their observations, the authors concluded that higher levels of chocolate consumption could be linked to a lower risk of cardiometabolic disorders.\n\nThey call for further experimental studies to confirm whether consuming chocolate is beneficial.\n\n4) Stroke\n\nCanadian scientists, in a study involving 44,489 individuals, found that people who ate one serving of chocolate were 22 percent less likely to experience a stroke than those who did not. Also, those who had about two ounces of chocolate a week were 46 percent less likely to die from a stroke.\n\nA further study, published in the journal Heart in 2015, tracked the impact of diet on the long-term health of 25,000 men and women.\n\nThe findings suggested that eating up to 100 grams (g) of chocolate each day may be linked to a lower risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\n5) Fetal growth and development\n\nEating 30 g (about one ounce) of chocolate every day during pregnancy might benefit fetal growth and development, according to a study presented at the 2016 Pregnancy Meeting of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine in Atlanta, GA.\n\n6) Athletic performance\n\nShare on Pinterest Chocolate may help athletes cover more distance while using less oxygen.\n\nFindings published in The Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition suggest that a little dark chocolate might boost oxygen availability during fitness training.\n\nResearchers who studied cyclists doing time trials in the United Kingdom found that \xe2\x80\x9cAfter eating dark chocolate, the riders used less oxygen when cycling at a moderate pace and also covered more distance in a two-minute flat-out time trial.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe scientists believe that the success of dark chocolate in this case is that it contains flavonols known as epicatechins, which enhance the release of nitric oxide in the body. Beetroot juice has a similar effect.'";"Other";"702.txt-Other"
"704.txt";"b'Chocolate is the most popular sweet treat in the world. People around the world (but mostly in Europe and the United States) consume more than 3 million tons of cocoa beans a year, according to the World Cocoa Foundation. And, not only does eating chocolate make you feel good, it may also be good for your heart and your brain.\n\nWhat is chocolate?\n\nChocolate is prepared from the fruit of the Theobroma cacao, a tropical tree whose name means ""food of the gods"" in Greek, according to ""Chocolate: Food of the Gods,"" an online exhibit by the Cornell University Library.\n\nTheobroma cacao trees are native to the Amazon and Orinoco river basins in South America. The trees are widely distributed from southeastern Mexico to the Amazon River. They thrive in hot, humid areas within about 20 degrees of the equator, according to Cornell. As the popularity of chocolate spread, growers established plantations in other regions, such as West Africa and South and Southeast Asia. Today, Ghana, C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire, Nigeria, Indonesia and Brazil account for 79 percent of the world\'s cacao production.\n\nCacao trees bear fruit that are about the same size and shape of a papaya, according to Patric Chocolate. These bumpy, lumpy berries, or pods, are full of up to 50 sour seeds, or beans, covered in white pulp.\n\nCacao seeds are harvested by hand because machines could injure the trees, according to Cornell. Workers remove the pods, which are orange when they are ripe, and open them with a machete. The seeds are placed in large fermentation trays that are stacked and covered in banana leaves, where they are left for two to seven days. Fermentation produces the chocolate flavor and aroma. It also destroys the seed\'s embryo, preventing unwanted germination, and causes the white pulp to fall away from the seeds.\n\nAfter fermenting, the beans dry out on sunny platforms. Workers turn them several times a day for three to five days to complete drying. The beans can dry faster in rotary driers but sun-dried beans taste the best, according to Cornell.\n\nNext, the beans are taken to the chocolate factory, where they are cleaned and debris is removed. The beans are roasted in large, rotating ovens. The roasting draws out flavor and removes the beans from their hulls. Roasted beans go into a winnowing machine, which cracks the beans and removes hulls. The remaining part of the bean is called the nib. Nibs become chocolate.\n\nThe nibs are ground down under a series of rollers. This process results in a thick paste called chocolate liquor. Chocolate liquor does not contain alcohol (however, chocolate liqueur does). It is the main source of unsweetened baking chocolate, according to Pam Williams, co-founder and past president of the Fine Chocolate Industry Association (FCIA) and founder and lead instructor of Ecole Cocolat Professional School of Chocolate Arts.\n\nAt this stage, the type of chocolate being produced is determined. According to the FCIA, ingredients separate fine chocolate from that of average quality. ""Fine chocolate,"" as designated by the FCIA, contains only cacao liquor, cacao butter (optional), sugar, lecithin, vanilla (optional) and possibly milk fats and solids. Additional flavors or ingredients like nuts can be added later.\n\n(Image credit: Dreamstime)\n\nTypes of chocolate\n\nFine chocolate falls into three categories: dark chocolate, milk chocolate and white chocolate, Williams said.\n\nDark chocolate has chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, lecithin, sugar and vanilla.\n\nMilk chocolate has all of the above plus milk fats and milk solids.\n\nWhite chocolate contains everything milk chocolate does except chocolate liquor.\n\nChocolatiers debate whether white chocolate is really chocolate. Until 2002, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration considered it a confectionary rather than chocolate because it does not contain chocolate liquor. The Hershey Food Corp. and the Chocolate Manufacturers Association petitioned the FDA, which added a standard of identity for white chocolate. Because the FDA refers to it as white chocolate, rather than confectionary, some experts, like Williams, accept white chocolate as chocolate.\n\nWithin the three categories, the FDA also acknowledges several grades, Williams said. They include unsweetened or brute, which can be up to 99 percent chocolate liquor; bittersweet; semisweet; and dark milk chocolate. The type of chocolate depends on what ingredients are present and the percentage of cocoa, in addition to where the beans are from and the way they are prepared.\n\nHealth benefits of chocolate\n\nGood heart food\n\nSeveral recent studies have examined the role that chocolate may have on heart health. Cacao beans are full of phytonutrients, which act as antioxidants and provide additional benefits. Furthermore, cacao beans are rich sources of iron, copper, magnesium, zinc and phosphorus, according to the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Dark chocolate contains two to three times more beneficial flavanols than milk chocolate because milk chocolate\'s cacao concentration is diluted with milk and possibly more sugar.\n\nWhile most studies have found some correlation between chocolate consumption and reduced risk of heart problems, the amount and type of chocolate needed requires further study. A 2017 meta-analysis of the effects of chocolate on coronary heart disease, stroke and diabetes published in the journal Nutrients concluded that the most benefit was associated with moderate chocolate intake. The authors found little benefit in heart disease or stroke reduction among people who consumed chocolate more than three times a week. Protective effects against diabetes emerged at two servings a week, but that benefit disappeared if people had more than six servings a week.\n\nOn the other hand, the findings of a large-scale study of more than 150,000 primarily male U.S. veterans who did not have coronary artery disease at the beginning of the study, suggest that eating an ounce of chocolate at least five times a week may help prevent the risk of coronary artery disease-related events like heart attack and heart failure.\n\nChocolate may also help prevent the development of atrial fibrillation, a type of irregular heartbeat that increases the risk of heart failure, stroke and more. A study, published in the journal Heart in 2017, found that adults who ate chocolate at least once a month had 10 to 20 percent lower rates of developing atrial fibrillation than those who never or rarely ate chocolate.\n\nGood brain food\n\nChocolate may be good for the brain. Some studies have focused on chocolate\'s ability to improve cognitive function. A study published in the Journal of Alzheimer\'s Disease in 2016 found that chocolate consumption might lower the risk of cognitive decline in older people. The study looked at nearly 400 Portuguese citizens over age 65 and saw that those who ate a moderate amount of chocolate \xe2\x80\x94 on average, one chocolate snack a week; the study did not differentiate between milk and dark chocolate \xe2\x80\x94 decreased their risk of cognitive decline by 40 percent over two years. Those who ate more chocolate, or those who had more caffeine, saw fewer cognitive benefits.\n\nGood mood food\n\nChocolate is often associated with positive effects on mood, but the reasons why it makes some people feel good are debatable. Chocolate contains substances that stimulate the brain in the same way cannabis does, such as anandamines, and substances that have similar effects as amphetamine, such as tyramine and phenylethylamine, according to the Dartmouth Undergraduate Journal of Science. However, these substances are in very low concentrations \xe2\x80\x94 too low to induce an antidepressant effect.\n\nChocolate may interact with neurotransmitter systems that contribute to appetite, reward and mood regulation, such as dopamine, serotonin and endorphins, according to the 2013 article in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology. However, the authors noted, the effects may have more to do with chocolate\'s taste and smell than its chemical effects.\n\nA 2010 study published in Archives of Internal Medicine found a link between depression and chocolate consumption. The results showed that people who scored high on a screening test for depression consumed more chocolate than those who weren\'t considered depressed. However, the study pointed out that there is only a link, and cannot explain why. Since the participants were not followed over time, the researchers don\'t know whether eating chocolate ameliorates or amplifies a sad mood. The possibilities are many \xe2\x80\x94 from using chocolate as a sort of natural Prozac to the idea that chocolate might have some role in driving depression.\n\nHealth risks of eating chocolate\n\nLike many foods, chocolate is healthiest when eaten in moderation. The sugars and fats that are added to chocolate make it high in calories, which may lead to weight gain. Furthermore, many of the protective effects that chocolate may offer might be mitigated by overconsumption.\n\nHistory of chocolate\n\nScientists debate how long humans have been using and consuming cacao beans. Chocolate\'s history goes back at least 2,000 years, while historians Sophie and Michael Coe, authors of ""The True History of Chocolate"" (Thames and Hudson, 2013), suggest that it might go back four millennia. The word chocolate can be traced back to the Aztec word ""xocoatl,"" the name for a bitter drink made from cacao beans. This was the way chocolate was consumed until the Spanish conquistadors came to Central America.\n\nIn several pre-Columbian Latin American societies, cacao beans were used as currency, according to Smithsonian magazine. Mayans and Aztecs believed the beans had mystical properties and used them during important rituals. When the Spanish arrived, sweetened chocolate came into existence. Legend has it that the Aztec king Montezuma gave conquistador Hern\xc3\xa1n Cort\xc3\xa9s a bitter chocolate drink, which he said was disgusting. But Cort\xc3\xa9s\' men added cane sugar and honey to it and took it back to Spain, where it quickly became popular.\n\nChocolate was a fashionable drink for rich Europeans throughout the 18th century. The Industrial Revolution allowed chocolate to be mass-produced and brought the treat to the masses. The popularity led to the development of cacao tree plantations.\n\nEnslaved people farmed most of the plantations. Initially, Spanish colonizers forced Mesoamericans to farm the cacao plantations, according to ""The Biography of Chocolate"" (Crabtree Publishing Co., 2005), by Adrianna Morganelli. When the indigenous peoples began to die in large numbers from diseases brought by Europeans, enslaved Africans were brought over to make up the labor shortage. In addition to sugarcane, indigo and other crops, enslaved Africans planted, maintained and harvested cacao trees throughout the Caribbean, Central and South America to feed the new European taste for chocolate.\n\nIn 1815, Dutch physicist Coenraad Van Houten experimented with removing varied amounts of the cocoa butter from chocolate liquor, according to Cornell University. This led to the creation of cocoa powder and soon solid chocolate.\n\nIn 1847, a Bristol, England, chocolate company, Fry\'s, created the first mass-produced chocolate bar when Joseph Fry added additional cocoa butter to Van Houten\'s chocolate, which turned it into a moldable paste, according to Bristol Museums. Milk chocolate was invented soon after with the help of Henri Nestl\xc3\xa9, who went on to found the major food company that bears his name. Major European chocolate brands Lindt and Cadbury also got their start in the 1800s; Rodolphe Lindt invented the conching machine, which gives chocolate a velvety texture.\n\nMass chocolate consumption hit the United States in the late 1800s when Milton S. Hershey began selling chocolate-coated caramels. He then developed his own formula for milk chocolate, purchased chocolate factory equipment and introduced mass-produced chocolate bars and other shapes, like Hershey\'s Kisses, in 1900.\n\nIn 1923, the Mars Co. developed the Milky Way bar by putting nougat inside a chocolate bar. That same year, former Hershey employee H.B. Reese introduced Reese\'s Peanut Butter Cups, which later became part of the Hershey brand.\n\nAs the years progressed, chocolate concoctions from both small and large producers became increasingly innovative. In September 2017, Swiss chocolate company Barry Callebaut introduced ruby chocolate. Ruby chocolate comes from isolating specific compounds in cocoa beans, according to Confectionary News. That, along with a modified processing technique, results in a rosy pink chocolate that has a sweet but sour berry taste and no traditional chocolate flavor, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. Other colored chocolates are made from dyed white chocolate.\n\nThreats to chocolate\n\nChocolate production is threatened by climate change. According to a 2016 report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the primary cacao-producing countries of C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire, Ghana, and Indonesia will experience a 2.1 degree Celsius (3.7 degrees Fahrenheit) increase in temperature by 2050. Rainfall will not rise along with the temperature, causing lowered humidity levels. As a result, viable land for cacao production will significantly shrink. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\'s Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability report, 89.5 percent of the 294 chocolate-producing locations studied would become less suitable by 2050.\n\nFarmers and scientists are working to develop strategies to maintain chocolate production. Some farmers are planting taller trees next to cacao trees to increase shade and decrease moisture loss, according to the NOAA. Cacao plantations may also move to higher elevations with cooler temperatures and greater rainfall.\n\nGenetic scientists are taking a different approach. A January 2018 press release from the Innovative Genomics Institute announced a project to develop disease-resistant cacao. Condensing cacao plantations because of climate change could increase the spread of disease. The project will use CRISPR DNA-editing technology to make a heartier cacao seed.\n\nEthics of chocolate production\n\nAccording to Slave Free Chocolate, 2.3 million children work in chocolate production in Ghana and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire, where they are vulnerable to trafficking, slavery and other violent labor practices. The International Labor Rights Forum reports that these children are often exposed to chemicals, work long hours and are denied education. According to Epicure and Culture, many children are sold into slavery and never see their families again. Others are kidnapped.\n\nThough the Harkin-Engel Protocol of 2001 was designed to stop child labor in the chocolate industry, according to the CNN Freedom Project, little has changed. The deadlines for action have been repeatedly pushed back.\n\nConsumers who want ethical chocolate should look for certifications designating Fair Trade, Rain Forest Alliance, UTZ, and Fair for Life, according to Slave Free Chocolate\xe2\x80\x99s guide to chocolate companies.\n\nChocolate production can also harm the environment. Farmers often clear forests to make room for cacao plantations. According to the World Wildlife Fund, about 70 percent of C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire\'s illegal deforestation is related to cacao farming. One danger of deforestation is soil erosion, which can make land less fertile for cacao plants, creating a vicious cycle, according to Confectionary News.\n\nAdditional resources'";"Other";"704.txt-Other"

The Maya considered chocolate to be the food of the gods, held the cacao tree to be sacred, and buried dignitaries with bowls of chocolate.\n\nFull Article\n\nchocolate , food product made from cocoa beans , consumed as candy and used to make beverages and to flavour or coat various confections and bakery products. Rich in carbohydrates , it is an excellent source of quick energy, and it also contains minute amounts of the stimulating alkaloids theobromine and caffeine .\n\nHistory of chocolate\n\nThe cacao tree was cultivated more than 3,000 years ago by the Maya, Toltec, and Aztec peoples, who prepared a beverage from its fruit, the cocoa bean (sometimes using it as a ceremonial drink) and also used the bean as a currency. The Maya considered chocolate to be the food of the gods, held the cacao tree to be sacred, and even buried dignitaries with bowls of the substance (along with other items deemed useful in the afterlife). In fact, the identification of the (Olmec-originated) word ka-ka-w (\xe2\x80\x9ccacao\xe2\x80\x9d) inscribed on those containers was key to deciphering the Maya\xe2\x80\x99s phonetic manner of writing.\n\nSpain was the earliest European country to incorporate chocolate into its cuisine, but exactly how that happened is vague. It is known that Christopher Columbus took cocoa beans to Spain after his fourth voyage in 1502, though little was made of it at that time. It has been commonly thought (though there appears to be no evidence) that in 1519 Montezuma II, the Aztec ruler of Mexico, served a bitter cocoa-bean drink to the Spanish conquistador Hern\xc3\xa1n Cort\xc3\xa9s, who subsequently introduced the drink to Spain. A strong possibility is that chocolate first arrived in Spain in 1544 with representatives of the Kekch\xc3\xad Mayan people of Guatemala, who came bearing gifts (including chocolate) to visit the court of Prince Philip. However, it was not until 1585 that the first recorded shipment of cocoa beans arrived in Spain from Veracruz, Mexico. Sweetened and flavoured with cinnamon and vanilla, chocolate was served as a hot beverage and became quite popular in the Spanish court. It was many years before chocolate had its introduction to France, England, and beyond.\n\nengraving of an Aztec with cocoa beans and chocolate beverage \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican with his chocolate pot and goblet,\xe2\x80\x9d an engraving of an Aztec with cocoa beans and chocolate beverage, from a French history of chocolate, tea, and coffee, 1685. From Traitez Nouveaux and curieux du caf\xc3\xa9 du th\xc3\xa9 et du chocolate, by Philippe Sylvestre Dufour, 1685\n\nIn 1657 a Frenchman opened a shop in London at which solid chocolate for making the beverage could be purchased at 10 to 15 shillings per pound. At that price only the wealthy could afford to drink it, and there appeared in London, Amsterdam, and other European capitals fashionable chocolate houses, some of which later developed into famous private clubs. In London many chocolate houses were used as political party meeting places as well as high-stakes gambling spots, notably Cocoa-Tree Chocolate-House (later the Cocoa-Tree Club), which opened in 1698, and White\xe2\x80\x99s, which was opened by Francis White in 1693 as White\xe2\x80\x99s Chocolate-House. About 1700 the English improved chocolate by the addition of milk. The reduction of the cost of the beverage was hampered in Great Britain by the imposition of high import duties on the raw cocoa bean, and it was not until the mid-19th century, when the duty was lowered to a uniform rate of one penny per pound, that chocolate became popular.\n\nMeanwhile, the making of chocolate spread overseas and grew in sophistication. Chocolate manufacture started in the American colonies in 1765 at Dorchester, Massachusetts, using beans brought in by New England sea captains from their voyages to the West Indies. James Baker financed the first mill, which was operated by an Irish immigrant, John Hanan. Waterpower was used for grinding the beans. In the Netherlands in 1828, C.J. van Houten patented a process for pressing much of the fat, or cocoa butter, from ground and roasted cocoa beans and thus obtaining cocoa powder. In 1847 the English firm of Fry and Sons combined cocoa butter with chocolate liquor and sugar to produce sweet (eating) chocolate\xe2\x80\x94the base of most chocolate confectionary\xe2\x80\x94and in 1876 Daniel Peter of Switzerland added dried milk to make milk chocolate.

"710.txt";"b'Share on Pinterest Screen Moment/Stocksy United Dark chocolate is loaded with nutrients that can positively affect your health. Made from the seed of the cacao tree, it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the best sources of antioxidants you can find. Studies show that dark chocolate can improve your health and lower the risk of heart disease. This article reviews 7 health benefits of dark chocolate or cocoa that are supported by science.\n\n1. Very nutritious If you buy quality dark chocolate with a high cocoa content, then it\xe2\x80\x99s quite nutritious. It contains a decent amount of soluble fiber and is loaded with minerals. A 100-gram bar of dark chocolate with 70\xe2\x80\x9385% cocoa contains (1): 11 grams of fiber\n\n67% of the DV for iron\n\n58% of the DV for magnesium\n\n89% of the DV for copper\n\n98% of the DV for manganese In addition, it has plenty of potassium, phosphorus, zinc, and selenium. Of course, 100 grams (3.5 ounces) is a fairly large amount and not something you should be consuming daily. These nutrients also come with 600 calories and moderate amounts of sugar. For this reason, dark chocolate is best consumed in moderation. The fatty acid profile of cocoa and dark chocolate is also good. The fats consist mostly of oleic acid (a heart-healthy fat also found in olive oil), stearic acid, and palmitic acid. The stearic acid has a neutral effect on body cholesterol. Palmitic acid can raise cholesterol levels, but it only makes up one-third of the total fat calories. Dark chocolate also contains stimulants like caffeine and theobromine, but it\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely to keep you awake at night, as the amount of caffeine is very small compared with coffee. Summary Quality dark chocolate is rich in fiber, iron, magnesium, copper, manganese, and a few other minerals.\n\n2. Powerful source of antioxidants ORAC stands for oxygen radical absorbance capacity. It\xe2\x80\x99s a measure of the antioxidant activity of foods. Basically, researchers set a bunch of free radicals (bad) against a sample of a food and see how well the antioxidants in the food can disarm the free radicals. The biological relevance of ORAC values is questioned, as it\xe2\x80\x99s measured in a test tube and may not have the same effect in the body. However, it\xe2\x80\x99s worth mentioning that raw, unprocessed cocoa beans are among the highest-scoring foods that have been tested. Dark chocolate is loaded with organic compounds that are biologically active and function as antioxidants. These include polyphenols, flavanols and catechins, among others. One study showed that cocoa and dark chocolate had more antioxidant activity, polyphenols, and flavanols than any other fruits tested, which included blueberries and acai berries (2). Summary Cocoa and dark chocolate have a wide variety of powerful antioxidants. In fact, they have way more than most other foods.\n\n3. May improve blood flow and lower blood pressure The flavanols in dark chocolate can stimulate the endothelium, the lining of arteries, to produce nitric oxide (NO) ( 3 ). One of the functions of NO is to send signals to the arteries to relax, which lowers the resistance to blood flow and therefore reduces blood pressure. Many controlled studies show that cocoa and dark chocolate can improve blood flow and lower blood pressure, though the effects are usually mild ( 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ). However, one study in people with high blood pressure showed no effect, so take this with a grain of salt ( 8 ). Given the great variation between studies on this subject, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that more research is needed ( 9 , 10). Summary The bioactive compounds in cocoa may improve blood flow in the arteries and cause a small but statistically significant decrease in blood pressure.\n\n4. Raises HDL and protects LDL from oxidation Consuming dark chocolate can improve several important risk factors for heart disease. In a controlled study, cocoa powder was found to significantly decrease oxidized LDL (bad) cholesterol in men. It also increased HDL and lowered total LDL for those with high cholesterol ( 11 ). Oxidized LDL means that the LDL cholesterol has reacted with free radicals. This makes the LDL particle itself reactive and capable of damaging other tissues, such as the lining of the arteries in your heart. It makes perfect sense that cocoa lowers oxidized LDL. It contains an abundance of powerful antioxidants that do make it into the bloodstream and protect lipoproteins against oxidative damage ( 12 , 13 , 14 ). The flavanols in dark chocolate can also reduce insulin resistance, which is another common risk factor for diseases like heart disease and diabetes ( 15 , 16 , 17 ). However, dark chocolate also contains sugar, which can have the opposite effect. Summary Dark chocolate improves several important risk factors for disease. It lowers the susceptibility of LDL to oxidative damage while increasing HDL and improving insulin sensitivity.\n\n5. May reduce heart disease risk The compounds in dark chocolate appear to be highly protective against the oxidation of LDL. In the long term, this should cause much less cholesterol to lodge in the arteries, resulting in a lower risk of heart disease. In fact, several long-term observational studies show a fairly drastic improvement. In a study of 470 older men, cocoa was found to reduce the risk of death from heart disease by 50% over 15 years ( 18 ). Another study revealed that eating chocolate two or more times per week lowered the risk of having calcified plaque in the arteries by 32%. Eating chocolate less frequently had no effect ( 19 ). Yet another study showed that eating dark chocolate more than five times per week lowered the risk of heart disease by 57% ( 20 ). A 2017 clinical trial found that subjects who consumed almonds with or without dark chocolate showed improved LDL cholesterol levels (21). Of course, these four studies are observational, so it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear exactly if it was the chocolate that reduced the risk. However, since the biological process is known (lower blood pressure and oxidized LDL), it\xe2\x80\x99s plausible that regularly eating dark chocolate may reduce the risk of heart disease. Summary Observational studies show a drastic reduction in heart disease risk among those who consume the most chocolate.\n\n6. May protect your skin from the sun The bioactive compounds in dark chocolate may also be great for your skin. The flavanols can protect against sun damage, improve blood flow to the skin, and increase skin density and hydration ( 22 ). The minimal erythemal dose (MED) is the minimum amount of UVB rays required to cause redness in the skin 24 hours after exposure. In one study of 30 people, the MED more than doubled after consuming dark chocolate high in flavanols for 12 weeks ( 23 ). If you\xe2\x80\x99re planning a beach vacation, consider enjoying some extra dark chocolate in the prior weeks and months. But check with your doctor or dermatologist before forgoing your normal skin care routine in favor of more dark chocolate.

Dark chocolate may also improve the function of your brain. One study of healthy volunteers showed that eating high flavanol cocoa for 5 days improved blood flow to the brain ( 24 ). Cocoa may also significantly improve cognitive function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment. It may improve verbal fluency and several risk factors for disease, as well ( 25 ). Additionally, cocoa contains stimulant substances like caffeine and theobromine, which may be a key reason why it can improve brain function in the short term ( 26 ).

"717.txt";"b'When most of us hear the word chocolate, we picture a bar, a box of bonbons, or a bunny. The verb that comes to mind is probably ""eat,"" not ""drink,"" and the most apt adjective would seem to be ""sweet."" But for about 90 percent of chocolate\'s long history, it was strictly a beverage, and sugar didn\'t have anything to do with it.\n\n""I often call chocolate the best-known food that nobody knows anything about,"" said Alexandra Leaf, a self-described ""chocolate educator"" who runs a business called Chocolate Tours of New York City.\n\nThe terminology can be a little confusing, but most experts these days use the term ""cacao"" to refer to the plant or its beans before processing, while the term ""chocolate"" refers to anything made from the beans, she explained. ""Cocoa"" generally refers to chocolate in a powdered form, although it can also be a British form of ""cacao.""\n\nEtymologists trace the origin of the word ""chocolate"" to the Aztec word ""xocoatl,"" which referred to a bitter drink brewed from cacao beans. The Latin name for the cacao tree, Theobroma cacao, means ""food of the gods.""\n\nMany modern historians have estimated that chocolate has been around for about 2000 years, but recent research suggests that it may be even older.\n\nIn the book The True History of Chocolate, authors Sophie and Michael Coe make a case that the earliest linguistic evidence of chocolate consumption stretches back three or even four millennia, to pre-Columbian cultures of Mesoamerica such as the Olmec.\n\nLast November, anthropologists from the University of Pennsylvania announced the discovery of cacao residue on pottery excavated in Honduras that could date back as far as 1400 B.C.E. It appears that the sweet pulp of the cacao fruit, which surrounds the beans, was fermented into an alcoholic beverage of the time.\n\n""Who would have thought, looking at this, that you can eat it?"" said Richard Hetzler, executive chef of the caf\xc3\xa9 at the Smithsonian\'s National Museum of the American Indian, as he displayed a fresh cacao pod during a recent chocolate-making demonstration. ""You would have to be pretty hungry, and pretty creative!""\n\nIt\'s hard to pin down exactly when chocolate was born, but it\'s clear that it was cherished from the start. For several centuries in pre-modern Latin America, cacao beans were considered valuable enough to use as currency. One bean could be traded for a tamale, while 100 beans could purchase a good turkey hen, according to a 16th-century Aztec document.\n\nBoth the Mayans and Aztecs believed the cacao bean had magical, or even divine, properties, suitable for use in the most sacred rituals of birth, marriage and death. According to Chloe Doutre-Roussel\'s book The Chocolate Connoisseur, Aztec sacrifice victims who felt too melancholy to join in ritual dancing before their death were often given a gourd of chocolate (tinged with the blood of previous victims) to cheer them up. Sweetened chocolate didn\'t appear until Europeans discovered the Americas and sampled the native cuisine. Legend has it that the Aztec king Montezuma welcomed the Spanish explorer Hernando Cortes with a banquet that included drinking chocolate, having tragically mistaken him for a reincarnated deity instead of a conquering invader. Chocolate didn\'t suit the foreigners\' tastebuds at first \xe2\x80\x93one described it in his writings as ""a bitter drink for pigs"" \xe2\x80\x93 but once mixed with honey or cane sugar, it quickly became popular throughout Spain. By the 17th century, chocolate was a fashionable drink throughout Europe, believed to have nutritious, medicinal and even aphrodisiac properties (it\'s rumored that Casanova was especially fond of the stuff). But it remained largely a privilege of the rich until the invention of the steam engine made mass production possible in the late 1700s. In 1828, a Dutch chemist found a way to make powdered chocolate by removing about half the natural fat (cacao butter) from chocolate liquor, pulverizing what remained and treating the mixture with alkaline salts to cut the bitter taste. His product became known as ""Dutch cocoa,"" and it soon led to the creation of solid chocolate. The creation of the first modern chocolate bar is credited to Joseph Fry, who in 1847 discovered that he could make a moldable chocolate paste by adding melted cacao butter back into Dutch cocoa. By 1868, a little company called Cadbury was marketing boxes of chocolate candies in England. Milk chocolate hit the market a few years later, pioneered by another name that may ring a bell \xe2\x80\x93 Nestle. In America, chocolate was so valued during the Revolutionary War that it was included in soldiers\' rations and used in lieu of wages. While most of us probably wouldn\'t settle for a chocolate paycheck these days, statistics show that the humble cacao bean is still a powerful economic force. Chocolate manufacturing is a more than 4-billion-dollar industry in the United States, and the average American eats at least half a pound of the stuff per month. In the 20th century, the word ""chocolate"" expanded to include a range of affordable treats with more sugar and additives than actual cacao in them, often made from the hardiest but least flavorful of the bean varieties (forastero). But more recently, there\'s been a ""chocolate revolution,"" Leaf said, marked by an increasing interest in high-quality, handmade chocolates and sustainable, effective cacao farming and harvesting methods. Major corporations like Hershey\'s have expanded their artisanal chocolate lines by purchasing smaller producers known for premium chocolates, such as Scharffen Berger and Dagoba, while independent chocolatiers continue to flourish as well. ""I see more and more American artisans doing incredible things with chocolate,"" Leaf said. ""Although, I admit that I tend to look at the world through cocoa-tinted glasses.""'";"Other";"717.txt-Other"

"723.txt";"b'Is Chocolate Good for Your Heart?\n\nWhy a little, in moderation, may be beneficial\n\nChocolate has gotten a lot of media coverage in recent years because it\'s believed that it may help protect your cardiovascular system. The reasoning being that the cocoa bean is rich in a class of plant nutrients called flavonoids.\n\nFlavonoids help protect plants from environmental toxins and help repair damage. They can be found in a variety of foods, such as fruits and vegetables. When we eat foods rich in flavonoids, it appears that we also benefit from this ""antioxidant"" power.\n\nAntioxidants are believed to help the body\'s cells resist damage caused by free radicals that are formed by normal bodily processes, such as breathing, and from environmental contaminants, like cigarette smoke. If your body does not have enough antioxidants to combat the amount of oxidation that occurs, it can become damaged by free radicals. For example, an increase in oxidation can cause low-density lipoprotein (LDL), also known as ""bad"" cholesterol, to form plaque on the artery walls.\n\nFlavanols are the main type of flavonoid found in cocoa and chocolate. In addition to having antioxidant qualities, research shows that flavanols have other potential influences on vascular health, such as lowering blood pressure, improving blood flow to the brain and heart, and making blood platelets less sticky and able to clot.\n\nThese plant chemicals aren\xe2\x80\x99t only found in chocolate. In fact, a wide variety of foods and beverages are rich in flavonols. These include cranberries, apples, peanuts, onions, tea and red wine.\n\nAre all types of chocolate healthy?\n\nBefore you grab a chocolate candy bar or slice of chocolate cake, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand that not all forms of chocolate contain high levels of flavanols.\n\nCocoa naturally has a very strong, pungent taste, which comes from the flavanols. When cocoa is processed into your favorite chocolate products, it goes through several steps to reduce this taste. The more chocolate is processed (through things like fermentation, alkalizing, roasting, etc.), the more flavanols are lost.\n\nMost commercial chocolates are highly processed. Although it was once believed that dark chocolate contained the highest levels of flavanols, recent research indicates that, depending on how the dark chocolate was processed, this may not be true. The good news is that most major chocolate manufacturers are looking for ways to keep the flavanols in their processed chocolates. But for now, your best choices are likely dark chocolate over milk chocolate (especially milk chocolate that is loaded with other fats and sugars) and cocoa powder that has not undergone Dutch processing (cocoa that is treated with an alkali to neutralize its natural acidity).\n\nWhat about all of the fat in chocolate?\n\nYou may be surprised to learn that chocolate isn\xe2\x80\x99t as bad for you as once believed.\n\nThe fat in chocolate comes from cocoa butter and is made up of equal amounts of oleic acid (a heart-healthy monounsaturated fat also found in olive oil), stearic and palmitic acids. Stearic and palmitic acids are forms of saturated fat. You may know that saturated fats are linked to increases in LDL cholesterol and the risk of heart disease.\n\nBut, research shows that stearic acid appears to have a neutral effect on cholesterol, neither raising nor lowering it. Although palmitic acid does affect cholesterol levels, it only makes up one-third of the fat calories in chocolate. Still, this does not mean you can eat all the dark chocolate you\xe2\x80\x99d like.\n\nFirst, be careful about the type of dark chocolate you choose: chewy caramel-marshmallow-nut-covered dark chocolate is by no means a heart-healthy food option. Watch out for those extra ingredients that can add lots of extra fat and calories. Second, there is currently no established serving size of chocolate to help you reap the cardiovascular benefits it may offer, and more research is needed in this area. However, we do know that you no longer need to feel guilty if you enjoy a small piece of dark chocolate once in a while.\n\nSo, for now, enjoy moderate portions of chocolate (e.g., 1 ounce) a few times per week, and don\xe2\x80\x99t forget to eat other flavonoid-rich foods like apples, red wine, tea, onions and cranberries.'";"Other";"723.txt-Other"

"730.txt";"b""Originally consumed as a bitter drink, it was prized as both an aphrodisiac and an energy booster.\n\nMankind\xe2\x80\x99s love affair with chocolate stretches back more than five millennia. Produced from the seeds of tropical cacao trees native to the rainforests of Central and South America, chocolate was long considered the \xe2\x80\x9cfood of the gods,\xe2\x80\x9d and later, a delicacy for the elite. But for most of its history, it was actually consumed as a bitter beverage rather than the sweet, edible treat it has become worldwide.\n\nWhat Is the Birthplace of Chocolate?\n\nMayan cacao drink Ren Photo/Getty Images\n\nArchaeologists have discovered the earliest traces of cacao in pottery used by the ancient Mayo-Chinchipe culture 5,300 years ago in the upper Amazon region of Ecuador. Chocolate played an important political, spiritual and economic role in ancient Mesoamerican civilizations, which ground roasted cacao beans into a paste that they mixed with water, vanilla, chili peppers and other spices to brew a frothy chocolate drink.\n\nAncient Mesoamericans believed chocolate was an energy booster and aphrodisiac with mystical and medicinal qualities. The Mayans, who considered cacao a gift from the gods, used chocolate for sacred ceremonies and funeral offerings. Wealthy Mayans drank foaming chocolate drinks, while commoners consumed chocolate in a cold porridge-like dish.\n\nAs people of the Aztec empire spread across Mesoamerica in the 1400s, they too began to prize cacao. Since they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t grow it in the dry highlands of central Mexico, they traded with the Mayans for the beans, which they even used as currency. (In the 1500s, Aztecs could purchase a turkey hen or a hare for 100 beans.) By one account, the 16th-century Aztec ruler Moctezuma II drank 50 cups of chocolate a day out of a golden goblet to increase his libido.\n\nWATCH: Season 1 of The Food That Built America without signing in now.\n\nSpaniards Introduce Chocolate to Europe\xe2\x80\x99s Elite\n\nChocolate arrived in Europe during the 1500s, likely brought by both Spanish friars and conquistadors who had traveled to the Americas. Although the Spanish sweetened the bitter drink with cane sugar and cinnamon, one thing remained unchanged: Chocolate reigned as a delectable symbol of luxury, wealth and power\xe2\x80\x94an expensive import sipped by royal lips, and affordable only to Spanish elites.\n\nChocolate\xe2\x80\x99s popularity eventually spread to other European courts, where aristocrats consumed it as a magic elixir with health benefits. To slake their growing thirst for chocolate, European powers established colonial plantations in equatorial regions around the world to grow cacao and sugar. When diseases brought by Europeans depleted the native Mesoamerican labor pool, African slaves were imported to the Americas to work on the plantations and maintain chocolate production.\n\nChocolate remained an aristocratic nectar until the 1828 invention of the cocoa press revolutionized its production. Attributed in varying accounts to either Dutch chemist Coenraad Johannes van Houten or his father, Casparus, the cocoa press squeezed the fatty butter from roasted cacao beans, leaving behind a dry cake that could be pulverized into a fine powder that could be mixed with liquids and other ingredients, poured into molds and solidified into edible, easily digestible chocolate. The cocoa press ushered in the modern era of chocolate by enabling it to be used as a confectionary ingredient, and the resulting drop in production costs made chocolate much more affordable.\n\nREAD MORE: Why the Candy Bar Market Exploded After WWI\n\nChocolate Becomes a Treat for the Masses\n\n10 Gallery 10 Images\n\nIn 1847, British chocolate company J.S. Fry & Sons created the first edible chocolate bar from cocoa butter, cocoa powder and sugar. Rival chocolatier Cadbury\xe2\x80\x99s, credited with pioneering the Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day chocolate box and chocolate Easter egg, followed suit soon after and in 1854 earned a royal warrant as purveyors of chocolate to Queen Victoria.\n\nIt was in Switzerland that chocolate production took one of its greatest leaps forward. In the 1870s, Swiss chocolatier Daniel Peter utilized a powdered milk developed several years earlier by his neighbor Henri Nestl\xc3\xa9 to produce the first milk chocolate bar, and the pair eventually formed the Nestl\xc3\xa9 Company. Swiss chocolatier Rodolphe Lindt\xe2\x80\x99s 1879 invention of the conching machine\xe2\x80\x94which used large stone rollers to mix and aerate chocolate to give it a velvety texture and superior taste\xe2\x80\x94allowed for the mass production of smooth, creamy milk chocolate.\n\nIn the United States, Milton Hershey pioneered the assembly-line production of milk chocolate. After selling his caramel candy company for $1 million and producing his first milk chocolate bar in 1900, Hershey bought farmland near his birthplace in rural Pennsylvania and built an entire factory town devoted to chocolate. The grass-fed Holsteins on the surrounding dairy farms supplied the company\xe2\x80\x99s milk, and a company town in Cuba supplied its sugar.\n\nREAD MORE: How Hershey's Chocolate Helped Power Allied Troops in WWII\n\nChocolate bars soared in popularity during the Roaring Twenties.

"758.txt";"b'Cocoa butter composition\n\nPrior to any refining, the fatty-acid composition of the CB used in this study was determined by gas-liquid chromatography. The CB used in this study is mainly composed of stearic acid (37.3%), palmitic acid (25.4%), and oleic acid (33.5%) (Supplementary Table 1), which closely matches typical literature values4. The phosphorus content of the unrefined CB is 88 \xc2\xb1 1 ppm, or 0.263 \xc2\xb1 0.004% equivalent phosphatides by weight (Supplementary Table 2), which is similar to the 0.34 \xc2\xb1 0.07% reported by Arruda and Dimick6. After refining, the phospholipids are completely removed from the CB. The FFA content of the unrefined CB is 1.65 \xc2\xb1 0.01% (as oleic acid) (Supplementary Table 3), which complies with the requirement of having <1.75% FFAs as oleic acid in Codex standards. This is reduced to 0.06% after neutralization and bleaching.\n\nCrystal structure and polymorphism\n\nPowder X-ray diffraction is the most unambiguous method for determining CB TAG polymorphism. In this study, CB samples were melted at 80 \xc2\xb0C for 30 min to clear the memory of crystallization and then crystallized statically at 23 \xc2\xb0C in an incubator for 1 day. Form IV displays wide-angle reflections corresponding to short spacings of 4.35, 4.15, 3.97, and 3.81 \xc3\x85, Form V has short spacings of 4.58, 3.98, 3.87, 3.75, and 3.67 \xc3\x85, while Form VI has short spacings of 4.59, 3.86, and 3.70 \xc3\x8510. Unrefined CB displays reflections corresponding to short spacings of 4.61, 3.88, and 3.71 \xc3\x85, which is characteristic of Form VI, matching literature values closely (Fig. 1; Supplementary Table 4)10. Additionally, the small-angle reflections corresponding to long spacings of 68.16 and 32.89 \xc3\x85 further suggest a Form VI polymorphism and a 3 L structure (polytype)11. CB TAGs in Forms V and VI stack as lamellae in the [001] direction with a dimension, which is proportional to three fatty-acid chain lengths, hence the nomenclature \xe2\x80\x9c3 L\xe2\x80\x9d. Other polymorphic forms stack as 2 L structures, the more common polytypic arrangement12.\n\nFig. 1: Powder X-ray diffraction patterns and differential scanning calorimetric traces (inset) of unrefined native CB, refined CB, and refined CB with added minor lipidic components. Samples included a unrefined native CB, b refined CB, c refined CB with added 0.1% (w/w) dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, and d refined CB with added 0.1% (w/w) dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine. Samples were crystallized statically at 23 \xc2\xb0C for 24 h. Full size image\n\nIn contrast, the refined CB sample displays a pattern that resembles a blend of Forms IV and V. Short spacings of 4.35 and 4.18 \xc3\x85 agree with literature values for Form IV, while 4.60, 3.99, 3.88, and 3.77 \xc3\x85 match those of Form V11. Furthermore, the long spacings include both 2 L (45.20 \xc3\x85) and 3 L (65.57 and 32.69 \xc3\x85) arrangements, indicative of the presence of Forms IV and V, respectively11. Thus, it appears that the removal of minor components in CB through refining drastically changes the crystal structure of CB.\n\nThe wide-angle region of powder XRD spectra of refined CB with minor components added back is generally characteristic of Form V, or a blend of Forms IV and V (Fig. 1c, d and Supplementary Fig. 1 (a\xe2\x80\x93f)). In the small-angle region, diffraction patterns suggest that the 3 L structure is present in all samples. Long spacings in the range 64\xe2\x80\x9368 \xc3\x85 correspond to the reflections of the (001) crystal plane. Higher-order reflections, up to ones corresponding to the (009) plane of this lamellar crystal, are also evident. However, there is also varying amounts of the 2 L structure present in the various samples, specifically Form IV, which imparts undesirable properties and stability to CB and chocolate, including a low melting point and excessive softness12. The DMPC, GMP, GMO, and FFA samples have little to no 2 L structure present, indicated by the lack of a (001) plane reflection corresponding to ~45 \xc3\x85. In contrast, DPPE and GMS CB samples display a strong 2 L reflection, suggesting a mixture of 2 L and 3 L structures.\n\nMelting point and enthalpy of fusion\n\nThe melting points and enthalpies of fusion determined by DSC were compared across the CB samples and are shown in Table 1. Example DSC curves are presented for each sample in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2. Wille and Lutton reported the melting temperatures for Forms I through VI as 17.3, 23.3. 25.5, 27.5, 33.9, and 36.3 \xc2\xb0C10, while Lovegren et al.13 reported lower melting temperatures for the same six polymorphs as 13, 20, 23, 25, 30, and 33.5 \xc2\xb0C. The melting point of the unrefined CB used in our study closely matches that of Form VI, as reported by Willie and Lutton10. However, once the CB is refined, the melting point drops to 28.8 \xc2\xb0C, indicative of Form IV. After adding specific minor components back into the refined CB, the melting temperature increases again. Phospholipid and MAG addition to refined CB yield samples with melting points in the range of 29.8\xe2\x80\x9332.2 \xc2\xb0C, suggesting that the CB crystals are in transition from Form IV to Form V, as reported by Wille and Lutton10. Finally, when FFAs are added to refined CB, the melting temperature increases back to about 34 \xc2\xb0C, which may indicate a mixture of Forms V and VI, as it is also similar to Form VI\xe2\x80\x99s melting point of 33.5 \xc2\xb0C13. These results are all in agreement with the XRD data.\n\nTable 1 Melting point and enthalpy of fusion of unrefined native CB, refined CB, and refined CB with added minor lipidic components. Full size table\n\nThe enthalpies of fusion follow a similar trend, with a higher enthalpy of fusion (143.9 J/g) for unrefined CB, which decreases significantly after refining (110.9 J/g). Again, the phospholipids and MAGs have a much smaller effect, if any, compared to the FFAs. With the FFA samples, the enthalpies of fusion are similar to that of the unrefined CB. Guthrie reported an enthalpy of 147 J/g for Form V CB, which decreased for less stable forms14.\n\nCrystallization kinetics\n\nThe crystallization kinetics of the CB samples were quantified using half-times derived from the Avrami model fitted to the SFC-temperature data, as shown in Fig. 2, with the calculated Avrami constants shown in Supplementary Table 515.\n\nFig. 2: Static crystallization growth curve of unrefined native CB, refined CB, and refined CB with added minor lipidic components crystallized at 23 \xc2\xb0C (symbols) and corresponding fits to the Avrami model (solid lines). The inset table indicates the half-times of crystallization derived form model fits. Refining CB accelerates its crystallization (a), as does 0.1% (w/w) phospholipid addition (b). Addition of 0.5% (w/w) saturated monoacylglycerols, glycerol monostearate, and glycerol monopalmitate, do not significantly affect crystallization kinetics, while addition of the unsaturated glycerol monooletate does (c). Free fatty-acid addition to refined CB at 0.5% (w/w) levels accelerates crystallization for stearic, palmitic, and oleic acids equally (d). Values represent means and standard errors of three replicates and values with the same superscript letter are not significantly different (P > 0.05). Full size image\n\nUnrefined CB has the longest half-time of crystallization at 281.9 min, which decreases to 202.3 min after refining. Statistically significant decreases (P < 0.05) in the half time of crystallization of unrefined CB are observed after addition of DMPC, DPPE, GMO, and all free fatty acids tested, including palmitic, stearic, and oleic acids. Chaiseri and Dimick reported that different phospholipids had different effects on crystallization rate, with certain phospholipids such as lysophosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol retarding nucleation, while others such as phosphatidylcholine promoting nucleation. They also highlighted that removing phospholipids through refining decreased the crystallization rate, indicating that phospholids may be necessary as initial crystallization seeds in CB1. This agrees with the data presented in this study, with the addition of phospholipids increasing crystallization rate. Arruda and Dimick reported a much higher relative concentration of phospholipids in seed crystals than in bulk CB, with the majority being phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine6. Thus, it appears that the added phospholipids may aid in the nucleation of CB TAGs.\n\nThe FFA and GMO CB samples have a slightly shorter half-time of crystallization relative to the refined CB sample, but the effects of palmitic and oleic acid are not statistically significant (P > 0.05). M\xc3\xbcller and Careglio focused their study specifically on FFAs, and reported slower crystal growth of unrefined CB with added stearic, palmitic, and oleic acids7. However, we do not observe this in our study. Chaiseri and Dimick reported that saturated free fatty acids increased the crystallization rate in the early stages of CB crystallization1.\n\nFew studies have been conducted on the effect of MAGs on CB crystallization. Chaiseri and Dimick suggested that their effects are small due to their low concentration in CB1. In our study, GMS and GMP, both saturated monoglycerides, do not significantly affect CB crystallization kinetics. Surprisingly, the unsaturated monoglyceride GMO enhances CB crystallization.\n\nPolarized light microscopy\n\nLight microscopy revealed subtle differences in the microstructure of the different CB samples (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 3). Although all images display feather-like spherulitic structures, the unrefined sample has smaller spherulites. DPPE addition, interestingly, leads to the formation of larger spherulites with a different texture than upon DMPC addition. The spherulites of the refined and DPPE samples display granular structures in the centre of the spherulites and feather-like crystallites in the periphery. The MAG samples all exhibit similar crystal morphologies, with both granular structures and small feather-like spherulites present. This is similar to the stearic and palmitic acid samples, though the FFA samples display a more granular structure. It appears that the MAG and FFA samples, excluding the oleic acid sample, revert the CB to the morphology of the unrefined sample. However, the oleic acid sample differs greatly from the rest, displaying large spherulites analogous to the refined CB sample.\n\nFig. 3: Polarized light microscopy images of unrefined native CB, refined CB, and refined CB with and without added minor lipidic components. Samples included a unrefined native CB, b refined CB, c refined CB with added 0.1% (w/w) dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, and d refined CB with added 0.1% (w/w) dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine. Samples were crystallized statically at 23 \xc2\xb0C for 24 h. Intensity and contrast were auto-levelled. Full size image\n\nAn aspect that became clear during the microscopy studies is that the spatial distribution of mass of CB is affected by the refining process and subsequent addition of minor lipidic components. One way to quantify this spatial distribution of mass is by determining the box-counting fractal dimension (D box ) of the images. A high fractal dimension is associated with a greater fill of the available embedding space with crystalline mass, as well as a higher order in the distribution of this crystalline mass. The box-counting fractal dimension provides a value that quantifies the level of space-filling, as well as self-similarity within a structure, which can be related to the nucleation process of CB. Supplementary Table 6 lists these values. The unrefined and stearic acid samples have the lowest average fractal dimension, with D box = 1.63 and 1.62, respectively. In contrast, the sample with the highest fractal dimension is the refined sample at D box = 1.75, followed by the phospholipid samples at ~1.72. Samples with a higher fractal dimension are expected to have originated from a higher nucleation rate, as this leads to more homogenous growth across an area. On the other hand, slower nucleation rates would result in more heterogeneous growth, leading to a lower fractal dimension for the resulting mass distribution 16.\n\nInterestingly, here we also discovered a statistically significant (r = 0.77, P < 0.01) inverse correlation between the melting temperature of the samples and their fractal dimension, as shown in Fig. 4. This may be related to the polymorphism of each sample and its corresponding nucleation process. For the unrefined sample, a high melting temperature of 36.4 \xc2\xb0C indicates the presence of the Form VI polymorph. The higher free energy of nucleation for this most stable polymorph results in low nucleation rates, leading to a more heterogeneous mass distribution and a lower fractal dimension. Conversely, the lower melting temperature of the refined sample suggests a mixture of Forms IV and V, which are metastable polymorphs. These polymorphic forms have greater rates of nucleation, resulting in a more homogeneous mass distribution and a higher fractal dimension16.\n\nFig. 4: Global relationship between the box-counting fractal dimension (D box ) of polarized light microscopy images of CB samples and their corresponding melting temperature (T m ). Fractal dimension values plotted represent the means of six images, while melting temperature values plotted represent the means of three replicates. Full size image\n\nMechanical properties\n\nThe hardness of both CB and chocolate samples containing some of the minor components was determined by 3-point bending, and the elastic bending modulus calculated. The elastic bending moduli (E B ) of unrefined CB, refined CB, and DMPC CB are 44.1 \xc2\xb1 3.4, 35.4 \xc2\xb1 4.4, and 39.0 \xc2\xb1 3.7 N/mm2, respectively. There is no statistically significant difference between these values (P > 0.05). The melting temperatures for these samples are the same as well, with the average being 34.3 \xc2\xb1 0.1 \xc2\xb0C.\n\nFor the chocolate samples, the addition of phospholipids to molten commercial chocolate (90% cocoa solids) allows the chocolate to maintain hardness without complex tempering procedures, such as crystallization at 5 \xc2\xb0C for 1 h and subsequent storage at 20 \xc2\xb0C for 4 days. Other trials with static crystallization at 23 and 26 \xc2\xb0C yield chocolates with undesirable mechanical and surface properties, suggesting that the use of phospholipids to promote proper tempering still requires some optimization of crystallization temperatures. DMPC and DPPE were added chocolate at 0.1% (w/w) levels, and their properties were compared to commercial chocolate both directly from the package and recrystallized under the same conditions as the doped samples (Table 2). The E B is similar between the commercial chocolate and the phospholipid-containing samples, but is significantly lower for the recrystallized commercial chocolate (P < 0.05). When the chocolate is melted and recrystallized without any additive addition, it becomes much softer. A greater E B indicates a stiffer chocolate, relating to the property of snap, which is desirable in chocolate. However, DSC analysis revealed that all the chocolate samples have similar melting temperatures, all indicative of Form V CB crystals. XRD patterns further confirm the presence of Form V CB crystals in all samples (Fig. 5). Thus, it appears that the polymorphism of CB in chocolate does not wholly determine its mechanical properties, and these mechanical properties may be attributed to the microstructure instead.\n\nTable 2 Elastic bending modulus (E B ), melting temperature, and whiteness index (WI) of commercial chocolate samples with added phospholipids. Full size table\n\nFig. 5: Powder X-ray diffraction patterns for commercial chocolate with added minor lipidic components. Chocolate samples were molten, blended with the minor components and crystallized at 5 \xc2\xb0C for 1 h, followed by 20 \xc2\xb0C for 4 days. The a commercial chocolate, b molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate, c molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added 0.1% (w/w) dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, and d molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added 0.1% (w/w) dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine, all display powder X-ray diffraction patterns characteristic of well-tempered \xce\xb2 2 , triclinic, Form V cocoa butter crystals. This crystal form displays a strong reflection corresponding to a short spacing of ~4.6 \xc3\x85 in the wide-angle diffraction region, and characteristic wide-angle reflections in the 2\xce\xb8 region 20\xe2\x80\x9325\xc2\xb0. In the small-angle diffraction region, only reflections from the 3 L (001) plane corresponding to ~62\xe2\x80\x9363-\xc3\x85 were observed. The absence of reflections from (001) plane of the 2 L polytype indicates the formation of the optimal polytypic form in the cocoa butter in all samples. Reflections at higher angles in the small-angle region correspond to higher-order reflections for these two crystal planes. Full size image\n\nProper chocolate tempering typically focuses on the melting behavior of the chocolate, in other words, the polymorphism of the chocolate\xe2\x80\x99s CB triacylglycerol crystals2,3. However, there is little consideration for the microstructure and mechanical properties when determining whether chocolate has been properly tempered or not. Here we show that addition of DMPC and DPPE helps achieve the desired hardness and fracture properties in chocolate, without directly impacting the polymorphism. This likely results from changes in the microstructure of the underlying CB fat crystal network, which arises from the phospholipids affecting the nucleation behavior of the CB.\n\nSurface reflectance\n\nProper tempering of chocolate results in a smooth surface with high surface gloss17. Bloom, for example, is often characterized by the appearance of a grayish white film on the surface of chocolate, attributed to the uncontrolled polymorphic transformation from Form V to Form VI18. This white appearance is due to the presence of large surface crystals, which scatter light impinging upon them19. This can be quantified using the Whiteness Index (WI), calculated from RGB surface color measurements17. A higher WI indicates a greater level of fat bloom on the surface of the chocolate, or may also indicate a rougher surface. The WI for each of the chocolate samples is shown in Table 2. The commercial chocolate and the DMPC chocolate sample have similar WI, suggesting a properly tempered chocolate for the DMPC sample. Moreover, a statistically significant difference is evident between the DMPC chocolate sample and the recrystallized commercial chocolate sample (P < 0.05), which was not tempered properly. The lower WI of the DMPC chocolate sample suggests that the addition of this phospholipid aided in the stability of the chocolate, resulting in less fat bloom and/or a smoother surface compared to the recrystallized commercial chocolate sample. The effect of DPPE addition to molten and recrystallized chocolate is not as clear since the WI is not statistically different from the commercial, DMPC or molten and recrystallized chocolates.\n\nChocolate microstructure by synchrotron-based micro-computed tomography (SR-\xc2\xb5CT)\n\nSynchrotron \xc2\xb5CT analysis revealed similarities between chocolate microstructure among all samples imaged at a <450 \xc2\xb5m length scale. CT voxel intensity is directly proportional to material density. The number of voxels with a given intensity is then representative of the number of volume fractions with a given density in the analyzed volume. The molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate sample (Lindt-R) displays the largest difference between samples, with a narrowing and shift of the histogram compared to the fresh commercial chocolate (Lindt-F), molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added DMPC, and molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added DPPE. This indicates a difference in material structure upon recrystallization. This is visually represented in volume renderings where the most notable difference is a reduction in the green intensity for Lindt-R, compared to the Lindt-F, DMPC, and DPPE samples, as seen in Fig. 6. Volume rendering movies of each sample can be seen in the corresponding links in Fig. 6.\n\nFig. 6: Volume renderings of reconstructed slices, plotted histograms, and correlation matrix of SR-\xc2\xb5CT data. Samples included a molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added 0.1% (w/w) dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC), Supplementary Movie 1; b molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added 0.1% (w/w) dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DPPE), Supplementary Movie 2; c fresh commercial chocolate (Lindt-F), Supplementary Movie 3; d molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate (Lindt-R), Supplementary Movie 4; e plotted histograms, and f correlation matrix. Full size image\n\nA comparison of the histograms shows qualitative differences in the overall density distributions, which make up the sample volumes in the images. A correlation matrix was generated by inputting the voxel count values for each binned 16-bit gray-value and generating a table of correlation coefficients between the four chocolates density distributions. The correlation matrices show a high positive correlation in the material\xe2\x80\x99s density distribution regardless of treatment; however, the least variance is observed between DMPC vs. Lindt-F and DPPE vs. Lindt-F. The highest correlation coefficient is found between DMPC and fresh Lindt, and DPPE vs. fresh Lindt samples, with a value of 0.9987. This suggests that the complex microstructure of Lindt chocolate with added DMPC and DPPE and crystallized isothermally, is more similar to that of tempered fresh Lindt chocolate than without these additives.\n\nOverall, we find that the presence of various minor components within CB results in major changes to its polymorphism, crystallization kinetics, and crystal morphology. By refining CB through neutralization and bleaching, the unrefined CB transitioned from Form VI to a blend of Forms IV and V, in addition to displaying faster crystal growth. Although adding MAGs and FFAs back into refined CB results in some small differences, phospholipid addition has the largest impact.\n\nAt 0.1% (w/w) levels, DMPC and DPPE both significantly increase the crystal growth rate of refined CB. However, the DPPE sample exhibits significant amounts of the 2 L polytype, while the DMPC sample only displays 3 L polytypism, which is the more stable and preferred nanostructure. When added to a commercial chocolate sample, DMPC and DPPE both template the Form V polymorph with optimal mechanical properties, surface gloss and microstructure. This may allow for the production of chocolate products without the need for laborious and complex tempering protocols.\n\nProper tempering is often judged by the resulting melting temperature, a function of the CB polymorphic form2. However, as we show in this study, the various chocolate samples were all in Form V as determined by DSC and XRD analysis, but display different mechanical properties. This suggests that there is more to tempering than achieving the Form V polymorph, and important qualities such as gloss and snap may be heavily dependent on surface and bulk microstructure. Thus, DMPC, DPPE, and possibly other saturated phospholipids can potentially be employed as effective additives for engineering the crystallization behavior, polymorphism, nanostructure, and microstructure in CB and chocolate products.'";"Other";"758.txt-Other"
"766.txt";"b'Is chocolate toxic to dogs?\n\nYes, chocolate is toxic to dogs. While rarely fatal, chocolate ingestion can result in significant illness. Chocolate is toxic because it contains a chemical called theobromine, as well as caffeine. Theobromine is the main toxin in chocolate and is very similar to caffeine. Both chemicals are used medicinally as a diuretic, heart stimulant, blood vessel dilator, and a smooth muscle relaxant. Dogs cannot metabolize theobromine and caffeine as well as people can. That is why dogs are more sensitive to the chemicals\xe2\x80\x99 effects.\n\nHow much chocolate is poisonous to a dog?\n\nThe amount of toxic theobromine varies with the type of chocolate. The darker and more bitter the chocolate, the more dangerous it is to dogs. Baking chocolate and gourmet dark chocolate are highly concentrated and contain 130-450 mg of theobromine per ounce. Common milk chocolate only contains about 44-58 mg/ounce. White chocolate rarely poses any threat of chocolate poisoning with only 0.25 mg of theobromine per ounce of chocolate. Even if the amount ingested is not a toxicity concern, dogs can still become ill from the fat and sugar in chocolate. These can cause pancreatitis in severe cases or in dogs that have more sensitive stomachs. To put this in perspective, a medium-sized dog weighing 50 pounds would only need to eat 1 ounce of baker\'s chocolate, or 9 ounces of milk chocolate, to potentially show signs of poisoning. For many dogs, ingesting small amounts of milk chocolate is not harmful.\n\nWhat are the clinical signs of chocolate poisoning?\n\nClinical signs depend on the amount and type of chocolate ingested. For many dogs, the most common clinical signs are vomiting, diarrhea, increased thirst, panting or restlessness, excessive urination, and racing heart rate. In severe cases, symptoms can include muscle tremors, seizures, and heart failure. Complications such as developing aspiration pneumonia from vomiting, can make the prognosis for chocolate poisoning worse. When in doubt, immediate treatment by your veterinarian is recommended if a poisonous amount of chocolate is ingested.\n\n""Clinical signs of chocolate poisoning can take hours to develop and last for days.""\n\nClinical signs of chocolate poisoning can take several hours to develop. Signs due to large exposures can last for days due to the long half-life of theobromine. This means that it remains in the bloodstream for a longer period. Theobromine may be re-absorbed from the bladder, so intravenous fluids and frequent walks to encourage urination may be necessary. It is important to seek medical attention by calling your veterinarian or Pet Poison Helpline as soon as you suspect that your dog has eaten chocolate.\n\nWhat should I do if my dog eats chocolate?\n\nContact your veterinarian or Pet Poison Helpline to see if a poisonous amount of chocolate was ingested. If a toxic amount is ingested, you should have your dog examined by a veterinarian immediately. The sooner treatment begins, the better your dog\'s prognosis.\n\nWhat is the treatment for chocolate poisoning?\n\nTreatment depends on the amount and type of chocolate eaten. If treated early, decontamination including inducing vomiting and administering activated charcoal to prevent absorption of theobromine into the body may be all that is necessary. Treatments of activated charcoal may be repeated to reduce the continued resorption and recirculation of theobromine.\n\nIt is very common to provide supportive treatments such as intravenous fluid therapy to help stabilize a dog and promote theobromine excretion. All dogs ingesting a toxic amount of chocolate should be closely monitored for any signs of agitation, vomiting, diarrhea, nervousness, irregular heart rhythm, and high blood pressure. Medication to treat restlessness and other signs may also be necessary\n\nI saw a treat made for dogs that contains chocolate. Isn\'t this dangerous?\n\nMany gourmet dog treats use carob as a chocolate substitute.\n\n""Carob looks similar to chocolate and the two are often confused.""\n\nCarob looks similar to chocolate and the two are often confused. Some specialty dog bakeries will use a small amount of milk chocolate in treats. Since the amount of theobromine is typically low, this may be safe for most dogs. However, most veterinarians recommend that you avoid giving your dog chocolate in any form.\n\nPet Poison Helpline, an animal poison control center based out of Minneapolis, MN is available 24/7 for pet owners and veterinary professionals that require assistance treating a potentially poisoned pet. The staff provides treatment advice for poisoning cases of all species, including dogs, cats, birds, small mammals, large animals and exotic species. As the most cost-effective option for animal poison control care, Pet Poison Helpline\xe2\x80\x99s fee of $65 per incident includes follow-up consultations for the duration of the poison case.

"789.txt";"b'Chocolate is toxic to dogs, and depending on the type and amount of chocolate consumed and the weight of your dog, it could cause a serious medical emergency. If you know your dog has eaten chocolate, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to monitor him for signs of toxicity (see below), and it\xe2\x80\x99s recommended that you contact your veterinarian or the Pet Poison Helpline (855-213-6680, fee applies) for advice.\n\nLearn how much is too much, which types of chocolate are the most dangerous, and what signs to look for that may signal your dog needs treatment.\n\nWhy Chocolate Is Toxic to Dogs\n\nChocolate contains both theobromine and caffeine, both of which can speed the heart rate and stimulate the nervous system of dogs, the Merck/Merial Manual for Veterinary Health explains. The risk of your dog becoming sick from ingesting chocolate depends on the type and amount of chocolate consumed and the weight of the dog (calculate your dog\xe2\x80\x99s risk of toxicity with this easy-to-use program). The concentrations of these toxic substances vary among different types of chocolates. Here are a few types of chocolate listed in order of theobromine content:\n\nCocoa powder (most toxic) Unsweetened baker\xe2\x80\x99s chocolate Semisweet chocolate Dark chocolate Milk chocolate\n\nKnowing how much and what kind of chocolate your dog ate can help you and your vet determine if you have an emergency. In general, mild symptoms of chocolate toxicity occur when a dog consumes 20 mg of methylxanthines per kilogram of body weight. Cardiac symptoms of chocolate toxicity occur around 40 to 50 mg/kg, and seizures occur at dosages greater than 60 mg/kg.\n\nIn simpler terms, that means a very concerning dose of chocolate is approximately one ounce of milk chocolate per pound of body weight. Since an average Hershey\xe2\x80\x99s Milk Chocolate bar is 1.55 ounces, consuming even one chocolate bar can have serious consequences, especially for small dogs. Eating a crumb of chocolate cake or a very small piece of a chocolate bar, on the other hand, probably won\xe2\x80\x99t kill your dog, especially if it is a larger breed, but chocolate should never be fed as a treat.\n\nWhat are the Signs of Chocolate Poisoning?\n\nSigns of chocolate poisoning usually appear within 6 to 12 hours after your dog has eaten it, may last up to 72 hours, and include the following:\n\nVomiting\n\nDiarrhea\n\nRestlessness\n\nIncreased urination\n\nTremors\n\nElevated or abnormal heart rate\n\nSeizures\n\nCollapse and death\n\nNote: Older dogs and dogs with heart conditions are more at risk of sudden death from chocolate poisoning.\n\nWhat to Do If Your Dog Ate Chocolate\n\nIf you believe your dog ate chocolate, call your veterinarian immediately or call the Pet Poison Helpline (855-213-6680) for advice. Based on your dog\xe2\x80\x99s size and the amount and type of chocolate consumed, your veterinarian may recommend that you monitor your dog for the clinical signs listed above and call back if his condition worsens.\n\nIn other cases, the veterinarian may prefer you bring the dog into the clinic. If your pet consumed the chocolate less than two hours ago, your veterinarian may induce vomiting and give him several doses of activated charcoal, which works to move the toxins out of the body without being absorbed into the bloodstream. For more severe cases, veterinary intervention may be needed to provide supplemental treatment, such as medications or IV fluids, to resolve the effects of the poisoning. Dogs suffering from seizures may need to be monitored at the clinic overnight.\n\nHow to Prevent Your Dog from Eating Chocolate\n\nEven though small amounts of milk chocolate may not cause a problem in larger dogs, it\xe2\x80\x99s still not recommended that pet owners offer their dog chocolate as a treat. To prevent your dog from sneaking chocolate, follow these tips:\n\nPut it away: Make sure all chocolate items, including cocoa powder and hot chocolate mix, are stored where the dog cannot reach them, such as on a high shelf in a closed-door pantry. Remind your children and guests that chocolate should be kept out of the dog\xe2\x80\x99s reach and not left on countertops, tables, or in purses. Keep this in mind during the holidays, too, making sure to place trick-or-treat bags, Easter baskets, Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day candy, Christmas stockings, and Hanukkah coins (gelt), for example, in a place where a dog cannot get to them.\n\nTeach \xe2\x80\x9cleave it\xe2\x80\x9d: The command \xe2\x80\x9cleave it\xe2\x80\x9d is extremely effective in preventing dogs from eating something that falls onto the ground or is left within reach during a walk.

"793.txt";"b""Many home chefs know that tempering chocolate to achieve a perfect finish and a satisfying 'snap' is no easy feat. Small variations in the quality of ingredients, temperature, mixing and timing can all set you up to fail, even when you learn from the best.\n\nThe results of a new study by food scientists from the University of Guelph in Canada suggest the addition of two common, naturally occurring fats \xe2\x80\x93 in the right proportions \xe2\x80\x93 might make chocolate tempering less of a gamble.\n\nPick up just about any block of milk chocolate from your local store, and you'll find it's more or less made out of the same things \xe2\x80\x93 cocoa butter for the form, cocoa mass (or chocolate liquor) for that familiar bitter taste, and additives like sugar or vanilla for sweetness and flavor.\n\nCrafting a solid bar of chocolate is a matter of encouraging the right size and distribution of crystals. In chocolate, crystalline forms of cocoa butter triglycerides (TAGs) are what give the food its characteristic shine, smooth texture, brittleness, and melting point.\n\nNot just any crystalline structure will do, either. Of the six distinct configurations of this class of molecule known to exist, Form V is the one that gives us a perfect temper.\n\nTempering \xe2\x80\x93 transforming the diverse mix of molecules into something that resists your bite while feeling heavenly smooth on your tongue \xe2\x80\x93 is a culinary process that has been gradually perfected over time, relying on a fine-tuned sequence of heating, mixing, and cooling.\n\nWhile researchers have investigated the influence TAG composition has on the success of tempering, little is known about how minor components of cocoa butter might make or break the process, including things like free fatty acids and phospholipids.\n\nGiven they make up just a few percent of the chemicals in cocoa butter, differences in their origins and refining might significantly alter the make-up of this key ingredient, either by helping the right crystals generate or interfering with their growth.\n\nPrevious research hinted at roles certain minor components had in the formation of the 'seed' crystals. For example, having a lot of free fatty acids seems to poison the crystallization process. Phospholipids, on the other hand, appeared to help them grow.\n\nTo nail down the precise proportions and chemical nature of these components, the researchers analyzed the exact make-up of a sample of cocoa butter, varying its composition by adding ingredients or bleaching out existing ones.\n\nThey then subjected it to a variety of tests to determine how variations in fat content might affect the growth time and proportion of crystal types, as well as things like melting point, surface reflection, micro-structure, and flex.\n\nWhile the amount of molecules such as free fatty acids had some effect, the real game-changer was the proportion of phospholipids, specifically saturated phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. Don't let the tongue-twister names fool you, though: these are garden variety biological molecules found in the membranes of living cells.\n\nBoth of these molecules in higher concentrations saw to the formation of Form V crystals, giving the cocoa butter the optimal glass, micro-structure, and mechanical properties.\n\nAdding the right amount of each to chocolate just might take the anxiety out of the tempering process, either by simplifying it or even eliminating it altogether.\n\nThis won't necessarily turn all of us into home kitchen dessertiers.

I had been wanting something sweet and since it was so hot outside, I decided I wanted ice cream. At the store, I saw the talenti pints of gelato and thought, ""how cute, I can reuse these."" I chose the coffee chocolate chip and I\'m so glad I did. It is creamy, has a full coffee flavor, and the chips are so thin and small they just melt away. I normally dislike chips in my frozen treats, but like I said, these just melted away nicely. My husband chose a the Belgian chocolate flavor and we were both disappointed with it compared to the coffee one. I ended up having to share mine with him which was fine since it is so rich I could only eat a little at a time.\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by DoctorEsq from Outstanding I have never been a coffee lover. Yes, in today\'s coffee addicted world that\'s strange but there you have it. I am, however, a tried and true Chocoholic. Yet the way Talenti has blended traditional coffee flavor with chocolate chips is truly outstanding. And the texture is perfect ~ a bit more solid then the other chocolate chip flavors especially in contrast to the Mediterranean Mint, Chocolate Chip, Peppermint Bark, etc ~ although all yummy, they melt far to quickly for my taste as I enjoy savoring the experience!! True, I pretty much love just about all the Talenti flavors and eat 1/2 a pint every night for my treat. But Talenti\'s Coffee Chocolate Chip has become one of my favorite flavors!\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by Auditory from This is what coffee flavor is all about In the mid-1960s when I was just a tot, my Sisters used to take me to a little shack that doubled as an ice cream parlor. The place featured a big name ice cream brand that is still one of the major players today. That\'s where I had my first taste of a coffee flavored frozen confection. Regrettably, the band name product today tastes nothing like I remembered it to have been. Fortunately, Talenti gelato has made that memory come back to life. With every spoonful, there is no guessing where the flavor is. Talenti has crafted a frozen dessert with an uncompromisingly strong coffee flavor that punches the tastebuds every time.\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by Kath12 from Delicious! My favorite ice cream flavor since I was young was Mocha. That flavor has disappeared. One night my daughter brought over brownies with a complimentary Talenti flavor. I fell in love with this gelato. Next time I went shopping I decided to buy the coffee with the chocolate chips. The first spoonful brought back the flavor I had longer for. It is now my nightly treat. All I need is 2-3 tablespoons full and I am totally satisfied until the next night. Sometimes I will mix it with one of your vanilla flavors & it is so yummy! No longer am I searching for this delicious flavor. I am totally hooked on Talenti brand gelato. I have enjoyed every flavor so far & I still have many more to try.\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by Baddie13 from Great Ice Cream This ice cream is delicious and is a great blend.

It\'s bolder than any other coffee flavored brands I\'ve tried so far. Normally I don\'t like ""stuff"" in my ice cream/gelato, but the ""chips"" in this one is more like shavings so it\'s not as noticeable (unlike their Double Dark Chocolate gelato which has chucks of chips). Best flavor so far from Talenti.'";"Other";"794.txt-Other"

Kudos, for those who never had the pleasure, were a kind of granola-candy bar hybrid made by Mars that debuted in the late \xe2\x80\x9980s. Comprising a granola bar topped by a peanut butter layer pebbled with crispy rice, the whole thing enrobed in waxy chocolate, those slim bars fueled my adolescence.\n\nSo maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s no wonder that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been craving the combination of peanut butter and chocolate as I prepare to send my own children back to school \xe2\x80\x94 real, in-person, full-time school \xe2\x80\x94 for the first time in a long time.

I took some liberties: Instead of a granola bar, I make my version with a simple shortbread crust that\xe2\x80\x99s pressed into the pan with your fingertips; it\xe2\x80\x99s sturdy enough to give the bar structure, but with a tender crumb and an irresistible brown butter flavor.

Almond butter can also be substituted. The bars are finished with a silky layer of dark chocolate, its bitterness acting as a foil for the sweet peanut butter layer. A dusting of finely chopped peanuts adds another textural element.\n\nI cut the bars into squat, skinny bars. While small, they are mighty, rich and intense.

The Maya considered chocolate to be the food of the gods, held the cacao tree to be sacred, and buried dignitaries with bowls of chocolate.\n\nFull Article\n\nchocolate , food product made from cocoa beans , consumed as candy and used to make beverages and to flavour or coat various confections and bakery products. Rich in carbohydrates , it is an excellent source of quick energy, and it also contains minute amounts of the stimulating alkaloids theobromine and caffeine .\n\nHistory of chocolate\n\nThe cacao tree was cultivated more than 3,000 years ago by the Maya, Toltec, and Aztec peoples, who prepared a beverage from its fruit, the cocoa bean (sometimes using it as a ceremonial drink) and also used the bean as a currency. The Maya considered chocolate to be the food of the gods, held the cacao tree to be sacred, and even buried dignitaries with bowls of the substance (along with other items deemed useful in the afterlife). In fact, the identification of the (Olmec-originated) word ka-ka-w (\xe2\x80\x9ccacao\xe2\x80\x9d) inscribed on those containers was key to deciphering the Maya\xe2\x80\x99s phonetic manner of writing.\n\nSpain was the earliest European country to incorporate chocolate into its cuisine, but exactly how that happened is vague. It is known that Christopher Columbus took cocoa beans to Spain after his fourth voyage in 1502, though little was made of it at that time. It has been commonly thought (though there appears to be no evidence) that in 1519 Montezuma II, the Aztec ruler of Mexico, served a bitter cocoa-bean drink to the Spanish conquistador Hern\xc3\xa1n Cort\xc3\xa9s, who subsequently introduced the drink to Spain. A strong possibility is that chocolate first arrived in Spain in 1544 with representatives of the Kekch\xc3\xad Mayan people of Guatemala, who came bearing gifts (including chocolate) to visit the court of Prince Philip. However, it was not until 1585 that the first recorded shipment of cocoa beans arrived in Spain from Veracruz, Mexico. Sweetened and flavoured with cinnamon and vanilla, chocolate was served as a hot beverage and became quite popular in the Spanish court. It was many years before chocolate had its introduction to France, England, and beyond.\n\nengraving of an Aztec with cocoa beans and chocolate beverage \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican with his chocolate pot and goblet,\xe2\x80\x9d an engraving of an Aztec with cocoa beans and chocolate beverage, from a French history of chocolate, tea, and coffee, 1685. From Traitez Nouveaux and curieux du caf\xc3\xa9 du th\xc3\xa9 et du chocolate, by Philippe Sylvestre Dufour, 1685\n\nIn 1657 a Frenchman opened a shop in London at which solid chocolate for making the beverage could be purchased at 10 to 15 shillings per pound. At that price only the wealthy could afford to drink it, and there appeared in London, Amsterdam, and other European capitals fashionable chocolate houses, some of which later developed into famous private clubs. In London many chocolate houses were used as political party meeting places as well as high-stakes gambling spots, notably Cocoa-Tree Chocolate-House (later the Cocoa-Tree Club), which opened in 1698, and White\xe2\x80\x99s, which was opened by Francis White in 1693 as White\xe2\x80\x99s Chocolate-House. About 1700 the English improved chocolate by the addition of milk. The reduction of the cost of the beverage was hampered in Great Britain by the imposition of high import duties on the raw cocoa bean, and it was not until the mid-19th century, when the duty was lowered to a uniform rate of one penny per pound, that chocolate became popular.\n\nMeanwhile, the making of chocolate spread overseas and grew in sophistication. Chocolate manufacture started in the American colonies in 1765 at Dorchester, Massachusetts, using beans brought in by New England sea captains from their voyages to the West Indies. James Baker financed the first mill, which was operated by an Irish immigrant, John Hanan. Waterpower was used for grinding the beans. In the Netherlands in 1828, C.J. van Houten patented a process for pressing much of the fat, or cocoa butter, from ground and roasted cocoa beans and thus obtaining cocoa powder. In 1847 the English firm of Fry and Sons combined cocoa butter with chocolate liquor and sugar to produce sweet (eating) chocolate\xe2\x80\x94the base of most chocolate confectionary\xe2\x80\x94and in 1876 Daniel Peter of Switzerland added dried milk to make milk chocolate. The proliferation of flavoured, solid, and coated chocolate foods rapidly followed.'";"Other";"8.txt-Other"
"801.txt";"b'Food produced from the seed of Theobroma cacao\n\nChocolate is a food product made from roasted and ground cacao pods, that is available as a liquid, solid or paste, on its own or as a flavoring agent in other foods. Cacao has been consumed in some form since at least the Olmec civilization (19th-11th century BCE),[1][2] and the majority of Mesoamerican people - including the Maya and Aztecs - made chocolate beverages.[3]\n\nThe seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor. After fermentation, the beans are dried, cleaned, and roasted. The shell is removed to produce cocoa nibs, which are then ground to cocoa mass, unadulterated chocolate in rough form. Once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating, it is called chocolate liquor. The liquor may also be cooled and processed into its two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter. Baking chocolate, also called bitter chocolate, contains cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions, without any added sugar. Powdered baking cocoa, which contains more fiber than cocoa butter, can be processed with alkali to produce dutch cocoa. Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, a combination of cocoa solids, cocoa butter or added vegetable oils, and sugar. Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder or condensed milk. White chocolate contains cocoa butter, sugar, and milk, but no cocoa solids.\n\nChocolate is one of the most popular food types and flavors in the world, and many foodstuffs involving chocolate exist, particularly desserts, including cakes, pudding, mousse, chocolate brownies, and chocolate chip cookies. Many candies are filled with or coated with sweetened chocolate. Chocolate bars, either made of solid chocolate or other ingredients coated in chocolate, are eaten as snacks. Gifts of chocolate molded into different shapes (such as eggs, hearts, coins) are traditional on certain Western holidays, including Christmas, Easter, Valentine\'s Day, and Hanukkah. Chocolate is also used in cold and hot beverages, such as chocolate milk and hot chocolate, and in some alcoholic drinks, such as creme de cacao.\n\nAlthough cocoa originated in the Americas, West African countries, particularly C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire and Ghana, are the leading producers of cocoa in the 21st century, accounting for some 60% of the world cocoa supply.\n\nWith some two million children involved in the farming of cocoa in West Africa, child slavery and trafficking were major concerns in 2018,[4][5] and continue to be. International attempts to improve conditions for children were doomed to failure because of persistent poverty, absence of schools, increasing world cocoa demand, more intensive farming of cocoa, and continued exploitation of child labor.[4]\n\nHistory\n\nMesoamerican usage\n\nTwo Mayans sit around a container of frothed chocolate.\n\nChocolate has been prepared as a drink for nearly all of its history. For example, one vessel found at an Olmec archaeological site on the Gulf Coast of Veracruz, Mexico, dates chocolate\'s preparation by pre-Olmec peoples as early as 1750 BC.[6] On the Pacific coast of Chiapas, Mexico, a Mokaya archaeological site provides evidence of cocoa beverages dating even earlier, to 1900 BC.[7][6] The residues and the kind of vessel in which they were found indicate the initial use of cocoa was not simply as a beverage, but the white pulp around the cocoa beans was likely used as a source of fermentable sugars for an alcoholic drink.[8]\n\nMan Carrying a Cacao Pod, 1440\xe2\x80\x931521. Volcanic stone, traces of red pigment. Aztec., 1440\xe2\x80\x931521. Volcanic stone, traces of red pigment. Brooklyn Museum\n\nAn early Classic-period (460\xe2\x80\x93480 AD) Mayan tomb from the site in Rio Azul had vessels with the Maya glyph for cocoa on them with residue of a chocolate drink, suggests the Maya were drinking chocolate around 400 AD.[9] Documents in Maya hieroglyphs stated chocolate was used for ceremonial purposes, in addition to everyday life.[10] The Maya grew cacao trees in their backyards,[11] and used the cocoa seeds the trees produced to make a frothy, bitter drink.[12]\n\nBy the 15th century, the Aztecs gained control of a large part of Mesoamerica and adopted cocoa into their culture. They associated chocolate with Quetzalcoatl, who, according to one legend, was cast away by the other gods for sharing chocolate with humans,[13] and identified its extrication from the pod with the removal of the human heart in sacrifice.[14] In contrast to the Maya, who liked their chocolate warm, the Aztecs drank it cold, seasoning it with a broad variety of additives, including the petals of the Cymbopetalum penduliflorum tree, chile pepper, allspice, vanilla, and honey.\n\nThe Aztecs were unable to grow cocoa themselves, as their home in the Mexican highlands was unsuitable for it, so chocolate was a luxury imported into the empire.[13] Those who lived in areas ruled by the Aztecs were required to offer cocoa seeds in payment of the tax they deemed ""tribute"".[13] Cocoa beans were often used as currency.[15] For example, the Aztecs used a system in which one turkey cost 100 cocoa beans and one fresh avocado was worth three beans.[16]\n\nThe Maya and Aztecs associated cocoa with human sacrifice, and chocolate drinks specifically with sacrificial human blood. The Spanish royal chronicler Gonzalo Fern\xc3\xa1ndez de Oviedo y Vald\xc3\xa9s described a chocolate drink he had seen in Nicaragua in 1528, mixed with achiote: ""because those people are fond of drinking human blood, to make this beverage seem like blood, they add a little achiote, so that it then turns red. ... and part of that foam is left on the lips and around the mouth, and when it is red for having achiote, it seems a horrific thing, because it seems like blood itself.""\n\nEuropean adaptation\n\nThe morning chocolate by Chocolate soon became a fashionable drink of the European nobility after the discovery of the Americas.by Pietro Longhi ; Venice, 1775\xe2\x80\x931780\n\nUntil the 16th century, no European had ever heard of the popular drink from the Central American peoples.[13] Christopher Columbus and his son Ferdinand encountered the cocoa bean on Columbus\'s fourth mission to the Americas on 15 August 1502, when he and his crew seized a large native canoe that proved to contain cocoa beans among other goods for trade.[19] Spanish conquistador Hern\xc3\xa1n Cort\xc3\xa9s may have been the first European to encounter it, as the frothy drink was part of the after-dinner routine of Montezuma.[9][20] Jos\xc3\xa9 de Acosta, a Spanish Jesuit missionary who lived in Peru and then Mexico in the later 16th century, wrote of its growing influence on the Spaniards:\n\nAlthough bananas are more profitable, cocoa is more highly esteemed in Mexico. . . Cocoa is a smaller fruit than almonds and thicker, which toasted do not taste bad. It is so prized among the Indians and even among Spaniards. . . because since it is a dried fruit it can be stored for a long time without deterioration, and they brings ships loaded with them from the province of Guatemala. . . It also serves as currency, because with five cocoas you can buy one thing, with thirty another, and with a hundred something else, without there being contradiction; and they give these cocoas as alms to the poor who beg for them. The principal product of this cocoa is a concoction which they make that they call \xe2\x80\x9cchocolate,\xe2\x80\x9d which is a crazy thing treasured in that land, and those who are not accustomed are disgusted by it, because it has a foam on top and a bubbling like that of feces, which certainly takes a lot to put up with. Anyway, it is the prized beverage which the Indians offer to nobles who come to or pass through their lands; and the Spaniards, especially Spanish women born in those lands die for black chocolate. This aforementioned chocolate is said to the be made in various forms and temperaments, hot, cold, and lukewarm. They are wont to use spices and much chili; they also make it into a paste, and it is said that it is a medicine to treat coughs, the stomach, and colds. Whatever may be the case, in fact those who have not been reared on this opinion are not appetized by it.[21]\n\n""Trait\xc3\xa9s nouveaux & curieux du caf\xc3\xa9 du th\xc3\xa9 et du chocolate"", by Philippe Sylvestre Dufour, 1685 , by Philippe Sylvestre Dufour, 1685\n\nWhile Columbus had taken cocoa beans with him back to Spain,[19] chocolate made no impact until Spanish friars introduced it to the Spanish court.[13] After the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs, chocolate was imported to Europe. There, it quickly became a court favorite. It was still served as a beverage, but the Spanish added sugar, as well as honey (the original sweetener used by the Aztecs for chocolate), to counteract the natural bitterness.[22] Vanilla, another indigenous American introduction, was also a popular additive, with pepper and other spices sometimes used to give the illusion of a more potent vanilla flavor. Unfortunately, these spices tended to unsettle the European constitution; the Encyclop\xc3\xa9die states, ""The pleasant scent and sublime taste it imparts to chocolate have made it highly recommended; but a long experience having shown that it could potentially upset one\'s stomach"", which is why chocolate without vanilla was sometimes referred to as ""healthy chocolate"".[23] By 1602, chocolate had made its way from Spain to Austria.[24] By 1662, Pope Alexander VII had declared that religious fasts were not broken by consuming chocolate drinks. Within about a hundred years, chocolate established a foothold throughout Europe.[13]\n\nmoulinet or swizzle stick, London 1714\xe2\x80\x9315 ( Silver chocolate pot with hinged finial to insert aor swizzle stick, London 1714\xe2\x80\x9315 ( Victoria and Albert Museum\n\nThe new craze for chocolate brought with it a thriving slave market, as between the early 1600s and late 1800s, the laborious and slow processing of the cocoa bean was manual.[13] Cocoa plantations spread, as the English, Dutch, and French colonized and planted. With the depletion of Mesoamerican workers, largely to disease, cocoa production was often the work of poor wage laborers and African slaves. Wind-powered and horse-drawn mills were used to speed production, augmenting human labor. Heating the working areas of the table-mill, an innovation that emerged in France in 1732, also assisted in extraction.[25]\n\nNew processes that sped the production of chocolate emerged early in the Industrial Revolution. In 1815, Dutch chemist Coenraad van Houten introduced alkaline salts to chocolate, which reduced its bitterness.[13] A few years thereafter, in 1828, he created a press to remove about half the natural fat (cocoa butter or cocoa butter) from chocolate liquor, which made chocolate both cheaper to produce and more consistent in quality. This innovation introduced the modern era of chocolate.[19]\n\nKnown as ""Dutch cocoa"", this machine-pressed chocolate was instrumental in the transformation of chocolate to its solid form when, in 1847, English chocolatier Joseph Fry discovered a way to make chocolate moldable when he mixed the ingredients of cocoa powder and sugar with melted cocoa butter.[22] Subsequently, his chocolate factory, Fry\'s of Bristol, England, began mass-producing chocolate bars, Fry\'s Chocolate Cream, launched in 1866, and they became very popular.[26] Milk had sometimes been used as an addition to chocolate beverages since the mid-17th century, but in 1875 Swiss chocolatier Daniel Peter invented milk chocolate by mixing a powdered milk developed by Henri Nestl\xc3\xa9 with the liquor.[13][19] In 1879, the texture and taste of chocolate was further improved when Rudolphe Lindt invented the conching machine.[27]\n\nBesides Nestl\xc3\xa9, several notable chocolate companies had their start in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Rowntree\'s of York set up and began producing chocolate in 1862, after buying out the Tuke family business. Cadbury was manufacturing boxed chocolates in England by 1868.[13] Manufacturing their first Easter egg in 1875, Cadbury created the modern chocolate Easter egg after developing a pure cocoa butter that could easily be molded into smooth shapes.[28] In 1893, Milton S. Hershey purchased chocolate processing equipment at the World\'s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, and soon began the career of Hershey\'s chocolates with chocolate-coated caramels.\n\nIntroduction to the United States\n\nThe Baker Chocolate Company, which makes Baker\'s Chocolate, is the oldest producer of chocolate in the United States. In 1765 Dr. James Baker and John Hannon founded the company in Boston. Using cocoa beans from the West Indies, the pair built their chocolate business, which is still in operation.[29][30]\n\nWhite chocolate was first introduced to the U.S. in 1946 by Frederick E. Hebert of Hebert Candies in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, near Boston, after he had tasted ""white coat"" candies while traveling in Europe.[31][30]\n\nEtymology\n\nCocoa, pronounced by the Olmecs as kakawa,[1] dates to 1000 BC or earlier.[1] The word ""chocolate"" entered the English language from Spanish in about 1600.[32] The word entered Spanish from the word chocol\xc4\x81tl in Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs. The origin of the Nahuatl word is uncertain, as it does not appear in any early Nahuatl source, where the word for chocolate drink is cacahuatl, ""cocoa water"". It is possible that the Spaniards coined the word (perhaps in order to avoid caca, a vulgar Spanish word for ""faeces"") by combining the Yucatec Mayan word chocol, ""hot"", with the Nahuatl word atl, ""water"". A widely-cited proposal is that the derives from unattested xocolatl meaning ""bitter drink"" is unsupported; the change from x- to ch- is unexplained, as is the -l-. Another proposed etymology derives it from the word chicolatl, meaning ""beaten drink"", which may derive from the word for the frothing stick, chicoli.[34] Other scholars reject all these proposals, considering the origin of first element of the name to be unknown.[35] The term ""chocolatier"", for a chocolate confection maker, is attested from 1888.[36]\n\nTypes\n\nChocolate is commonly used as a coating for various fruits such as cherries and/or fillings, such as liqueurs\n\nSeveral types of chocolate can be distinguished. Pure, unsweetened chocolate, often called ""baking chocolate"", contains primarily cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions. Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, which combines chocolate with sugar.\n\nMilk\n\nMilk chocolate is sweet chocolate that also contains milk powder or condensed milk. In the UK and Ireland, milk chocolate must contain a minimum of 20% total dry cocoa solids; in the rest of the European Union, the minimum is 25%.[37]\n\nWhite\n\nWhite chocolate\n\nWhite chocolate, although similar in texture to that of milk and dark chocolate, does not contain any cocoa solids that impart a dark color. In 2002, the US Food and Drug Administration established a standard for white chocolate as the ""common or usual name of products made from cocoa fat (i.e., cocoa butter), milk solids, nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners, and other safe and suitable ingredients, but containing no nonfat cocoa solids"".[38]\n\nDark\n\nDark chocolate is produced by adding fat and sugar to the cocoa mixture. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration calls this ""sweet chocolate"", and requires a 15% concentration of chocolate liquor. European rules specify a minimum of 35% cocoa solids.[37] A higher amount of cocoa solids indicates more bitterness. Semisweet chocolate is dark chocolate with low sugar content. Bittersweet chocolate is chocolate liquor to which some sugar (typically a third), more cocoa butter and vanilla are added.[39] It has less sugar and more liquor than semisweet chocolate, but the two are interchangeable in baking. It is also known to last for two years if stored properly. As of 2017 , there is no high-quality evidence that dark chocolate affects blood pressure significantly or provides other health benefits.[40]\n\nUnsweetened\n\nUnsweetened chocolate is pure chocolate liquor, also known as bitter or baking chocolate. It is unadulterated chocolate: the pure, ground, roasted chocolate beans impart a strong, deep chocolate flavor. It is typically used in baking or other products to which sugar and other ingredients are added. Raw chocolate, often referred to as raw cocoa, is always dark and a minimum of 75% cocoa.\n\nUnsweetened ""Baking"" Chocolate\n\nPoorly tempered or untempered chocolate may have whitish spots on the dark chocolate part, called chocolate bloom; it is an indication that sugar or fat has separated due to poor storage. It is not toxic and can be safely consumed.[41]\n\nProduction\n\nChocolate is created from the cocoa bean. A cacao tree with fruit pods in various stages of ripening.\n\nRoughly two-thirds of the entire world\'s cocoa is produced in West Africa, with 43% sourced from C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire,[42] where, as of 2007 , child labor is a common practice to obtain the product.[43][44] According to the World Cocoa Foundation, in 2007 some 50 million people around the world depended on cocoa as a source of livelihood.[45] As of 2007 in the UK, most chocolatiers purchase their chocolate from them, to melt, mold and package to their own design.[46] According to the WCF\'s 2012 report, the Ivory Coast is the largest producer of cocoa in the world.[47] The two main jobs associated with creating chocolate candy are chocolate makers and chocolatiers. Chocolate makers use harvested cocoa beans and other ingredients to produce couverture chocolate (covering). Chocolatiers use the finished couverture to make chocolate candies (bars, truffles, etc.).[48]\n\nProduction costs can be decreased by reducing cocoa solids content or by substituting cocoa butter with another fat. Cocoa growers object to allowing the resulting food to be called ""chocolate"", due to the risk of lower demand for their crops.[45]\n\nGenome\n\nThe sequencing in 2010 of the genome of the cacao tree may allow yields to be improved.[49] Due to concerns about global warming effects on lowland climate in the narrow band of latitudes where cocoa is grown (20 degrees north and south of the equator), the commercial company Mars, Incorporated and the University of California, Berkeley are conducting genomic research in 2017\xe2\x80\x9318 to improve the survivability of cacao plants in hot climates.[50]\n\nCacao varieties\n\nChocolate is made from cocoa beans, the dried and fermented seeds of the cacao tree (Theobroma cacao), a small, 4\xe2\x80\x938 m tall (15\xe2\x80\x9326 ft tall) evergreen tree native to the deep tropical region of the Americas. Recent genetic studies suggest the most common genotype of the plant originated in the Amazon basin and was gradually transported by humans throughout South and Central America. Early forms of another genotype have also been found in what is now Venezuela. The scientific name, Theobroma, means ""food of the gods"".[51] The fruit, called a cocoa pod, is ovoid, 15\xe2\x80\x9330 cm (6\xe2\x80\x9312 in) long and 8\xe2\x80\x9310 cm (3\xe2\x80\x934 in) wide, ripening yellow to orange, and weighing about 500 g (1.1 lb) when ripe.\n\nCacao trees are small, understory trees that need rich, well-drained soils. They naturally grow within 20\xc2\xb0 of either side of the equator because they need about 2000 mm of rainfall a year, and temperatures in the range of 21 to 32 \xc2\xb0C (70 to 90 \xc2\xb0F). Cacao trees cannot tolerate a temperature lower than 15 \xc2\xb0C (59 \xc2\xb0F).[52]\n\nThe three main varieties of cocoa beans used in chocolate are criollo, forastero, and trinitario.\n\nCriollo\n\nRepresenting only 5% of all cocoa beans grown as of 2008 ,[53] criollo is the rarest and most expensive cocoa on the market, and is native to Central America, the Caribbean islands and the northern tier of South American states.[54] The genetic purity of cocoas sold today as criollo is disputed, as most populations have been exposed to the genetic influence of other varieties.\n\nCriollos are particularly difficult to grow, as they are vulnerable to a variety of environmental threats and produce low yields of cocoa per tree. The flavor of criollo is described as delicate yet complex, low in classic chocolate flavor, but rich in ""secondary"" notes of long duration.[55]\n\nForastero\n\nThe most commonly grown bean is forastero,[53] a large group of wild and cultivated cocoas, most likely native to the Amazon basin. The African cocoa crop is entirely made up of forastero. They are significantly hardier and of higher yield than criollo. The source of most chocolate marketed,[53] forastero cocoas are typically strong in classic ""chocolate"" flavor, but have a short duration and are unsupported by secondary flavors, producing ""quite bland"" chocolate.[53]\n\nTrinitario\n\nTrinitario is a natural hybrid of criollo and forastero. Trinitario originated in Trinidad after an introduction of forastero to the local criollo crop. Nearly all cocoa produced over the past five decades is of the forastero or lower-grade trinitario varieties.[56]\n\nProcessing\n\nCocoa pods are harvested by cutting them from the tree using a machete, or by knocking them off the tree using a stick. The beans with their surrounding pulp are removed from the pods and placed in piles or bins, allowing access to micro-organisms so fermentation of the pectin-containing material can begin. Yeasts produce ethanol, lactic acid bacteria produce lactic acid, and acetic acid bacteria produce acetic acid. The fermentation process, which takes up to seven days, also produces several flavor precursors, eventually resulting in the familiar chocolate taste.[57]\n\nIt is important to harvest the pods when they are fully ripe, because if the pod is unripe, the beans will have a low cocoa butter content, or sugars in the white pulp will be insufficient for fermentation, resulting in a weak flavor. After fermentation, the beans must be quickly dried to prevent mold growth. Climate and weather permitting, this is done by spreading the beans out in the sun from five to seven days.[58]\n\nThe dried beans are then transported to a chocolate manufacturing facility. The beans are cleaned (removing twigs, stones, and other debris), roasted, and graded. Next, the shell of each bean is removed to extract the nib. Finally, the nibs are ground and liquefied, resulting in pure chocolate in fluid form: chocolate liquor.[59] The liquor can be further processed into two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter.[60]\n\nBlending\n\nChocolate liquor is blended with the cocoa butter in varying quantities to make different types of chocolate or couverture. The basic blends of ingredients for the various types of chocolate (in order of highest quantity of cocoa liquor first), are:\n\nFountain chocolate is made with high levels of cocoa butter, allowing it to flow gently over a chocolate fountain to serve as dessert fondue\n\nDark chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa liquor, and (sometimes) vanilla\n\nMilk chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa liquor, milk or milk powder, and vanilla\n\nWhite chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, milk or milk powder, and vanilla\n\nUsually, an emulsifying agent, such as soy lecithin, is added, though a few manufacturers prefer to exclude this ingredient for purity reasons and to remain GMO-free, sometimes at the cost of a perfectly smooth texture. Some manufacturers are now using PGPR, an artificial emulsifier derived from castor oil that allows them to reduce the amount of cocoa butter while maintaining the same mouthfeel.\n\nThe texture is also heavily influenced by processing, specifically conching (see below). The more expensive chocolate tends to be processed longer and thus has a smoother texture and mouthfeel, regardless of whether emulsifying agents are added.\n\nDifferent manufacturers develop their own ""signature"" blends based on the above formulas, but varying proportions of the different constituents are used. The finest, plain dark chocolate couverture contains at least 70% cocoa (both solids and butter), whereas milk chocolate usually contains up to 50%. High-quality white chocolate couverture contains only about 35% cocoa butter.\n\nProducers of high-quality, small-batch chocolate argue that mass production produces bad-quality chocolate.[53] Some mass-produced chocolate contains much less cocoa (as low as 7% in many cases), and fats other than cocoa butter. Vegetable oils and artificial vanilla flavor are often used in cheaper chocolate to mask poorly fermented and/or roasted beans.[53]\n\nIn 2007, the Chocolate Manufacturers Association in the United States, whose members include Hershey, Nestl\xc3\xa9, and Archer Daniels Midland, lobbied the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to change the legal definition of chocolate to let them substitute partially hydrogenated vegetable oils for cocoa butter, in addition to using artificial sweeteners and milk substitutes.[61] Currently, the FDA does not allow a product to be referred to as ""chocolate"" if the product contains any of these ingredients.[62][63]\n\nIn the EU a product can be sold as chocolate if it contains up to 5% vegetable oil, and must be labeled as ""family milk chocolate"" rather than ""milk chocolate"" if it contains 20% milk.[64]\n\nAccording to Canadian Food and Drug Regulations,[65] a ""chocolate product"" is a food product that is sourced from at least one ""cocoa product"" and contains at least one of the following: ""chocolate, bittersweet chocolate, semi-sweet chocolate, dark chocolate, sweet chocolate, milk chocolate, or white chocolate"". A ""cocoa product"" is defined as a food product that is sourced from cocoa beans and contains ""cocoa nibs, cocoa liquor, cocoa mass, unsweetened chocolate, bitter chocolate, chocolate liquor, cocoa, low-fat cocoa, cocoa powder, or low-fat cocoa powder"".\n\nConching\n\nChocolate melanger mixing raw ingredients\n\nThe penultimate process is called conching. A conche is a container filled with metal beads, which act as grinders. The refined and blended chocolate mass is kept in a liquid state by frictional heat. Chocolate before conching has an uneven and gritty texture. The conching process produces cocoa and sugar particles smaller than the tongue can detect (typically around 20 \xce\xbcm) and reduces rough edges, hence the smooth feel in the mouth. The length of the conching process determines the final smoothness and quality of the chocolate. High-quality chocolate is conched for about 72 hours, and lesser grades about four to six hours. After the process is complete, the chocolate mass is stored in tanks heated to about 45 to 50 \xc2\xb0C (113 to 122 \xc2\xb0F) until final processing.[66]\n\nTempering\n\nVideo of cocoa beans being ground and mixed with other ingredients to make chocolate at a Mayordomo store in Oaxaca\n\nThe final process is called tempering. Uncontrolled crystallization of cocoa butter typically results in crystals of varying size, some or all large enough to be seen with the naked eye. This causes the surface of the chocolate to appear mottled and matte, and causes the chocolate to crumble rather than snap when broken.[67][68] The uniform sheen and crisp bite of properly processed chocolate are the results of consistently small cocoa butter crystals produced by the tempering process.\n\nThe fats in cocoa butter can crystallize in six different forms (polymorphous crystallization).[67][69] The primary purpose of tempering is to assure that only the best form is present. The six different crystal forms have different properties.\n\nCrystal Melting temp. Notes I 17 \xc2\xb0C (63 \xc2\xb0F) Soft, crumbly, melts too easily II 21 \xc2\xb0C (70 \xc2\xb0F) Soft, crumbly, melts too easily III 26 \xc2\xb0C (79 \xc2\xb0F) Firm, poor snap, melts too easily IV 28 \xc2\xb0C (82 \xc2\xb0F) Firm, good snap, melts too easily V 34 \xc2\xb0C (93 \xc2\xb0F) Glossy, firm, best snap, melts near body temperature (37 \xc2\xb0C) VI 36 \xc2\xb0C (97 \xc2\xb0F) Hard, takes weeks to form\n\nMolten chocolate and a piece of a chocolate bar\n\nAs a solid piece of chocolate, the cocoa butter fat particles are in a crystalline rigid structure that gives the chocolate its solid appearance. Once heated, the crystals of the polymorphic cocoa butter can break apart from the rigid structure and allow the chocolate to obtain a more fluid consistency as the temperature increases \xe2\x80\x93 the melting process. When the heat is removed, the cocoa butter crystals become rigid again and come closer together, allowing the chocolate to solidify.[70]\n\nThe temperature in which the crystals obtain enough energy to break apart from their rigid conformation would depend on the milk fat content in the chocolate and the shape of the fat molecules, as well as the form of the cocoa butterfat. Chocolate with a higher fat content will melt at a lower temperature.[71]\n\nMaking chocolate considered ""good"" is about forming as many type V crystals as possible. This provides the best appearance and texture and creates the most stable crystals, so the texture and appearance will not degrade over time. To accomplish this, the temperature is carefully manipulated during the crystallization.\n\npistoles and callets Chocolate cubes,and\n\nGenerally, the chocolate is first heated to 45 \xc2\xb0C (113 \xc2\xb0F) to melt all six forms of crystals.[67][69] Next, the chocolate is cooled to about 27 \xc2\xb0C (81 \xc2\xb0F), which will allow crystal types IV and V to form. At this temperature, the chocolate is agitated to create many small crystal ""seeds"" which will serve as nuclei to create small crystals in the chocolate. The chocolate is then heated to about 31 \xc2\xb0C (88 \xc2\xb0F) to eliminate any type IV crystals, leaving just type V. After this point, any excessive heating of the chocolate will destroy the temper and this process will have to be repeated. Other methods of chocolate tempering are used as well. The most common variant is introducing already tempered, solid ""seed"" chocolate. The temper of chocolate can be measured with a chocolate temper meter to ensure accuracy and consistency. A sample cup is filled with the chocolate and placed in the unit which then displays or prints the results.\n\nTwo classic ways of manually tempering chocolate are:\n\nWorking the molten chocolate on a heat-absorbing surface, such as a stone slab, until thickening indicates the presence of sufficient crystal ""seeds""; the chocolate is then gently warmed to working temperature.\n\nStirring solid chocolate into molten chocolate to ""inoculate"" the liquid chocolate with crystals (this method uses the already formed crystals of the solid chocolate to ""seed"" the molten chocolate).\n\nChocolate tempering machines (or temperers) with computer controls can be used for producing consistently tempered chocolate. In particular, continuous tempering machines are used in large volume applications. Various methods and apparatuses for continuous flow tempering have been described by Aasted, Sollich and Buhler, three manufacturers of commercial chocolate equipment, with a focus now on energy efficiency. In general, molten chocolate coming in at 40\xe2\x80\x9350 \xc2\xb0C is cooled in heat exchangers to crystallization temperates of about 26\xe2\x80\x9330 \xc2\xb0C, passed through a tempering column consisting of spinning plates to induce shear, then warmed slightly to re-melt undesirable crystal formations.[72][73]\n\nShaping\n\nChocolate is molded in different shapes for different uses:[74]\n\nChocolate bars (tablets) are rectangular blocks of chocolate meant to be broken down to cubes (or other predefined shapes), which can then be used for consumption, cooking and baking. The term is also used for combination bars, which are a type of candy bars\n\nChocolate chips are small pieces of chocolate, usually drop-like, which are meant for decoration and baking\n\nPistoles , callets and f\xc3\xa8ves are small, coin-like or bean-like pieces of chocolate meant for baking and patisserie applications (also see Pistole (coin) and F\xc3\xa8ve (trinket))\n\n, and are small, coin-like or bean-like pieces of chocolate meant for baking and patisserie applications (also see Pistole (coin) and F\xc3\xa8ve (trinket)) Chocolate blocks are large, cuboid chunks of chocolate meant for professional use and further processing\n\nOther, more specialized shapes for chocolate include sticks, curls and hollow semi-spheres\n\nStorage\n\nChocolate is very sensitive to temperature and humidity. Ideal storage temperatures are between 15 and 17 \xc2\xb0C (59 and 63 \xc2\xb0F), with a relative humidity of less than 50%. If refrigerated or frozen without containment, chocolate can absorb enough moisture to cause a whitish discoloration, the result of fat or sugar crystals rising to the surface. Various types of ""blooming"" effects can occur if chocolate is stored or served improperly.[75]\n\nChocolate bloom is caused by storage temperature fluctuating or exceeding 24 \xc2\xb0C (75 \xc2\xb0F), while sugar bloom is caused by temperature below 15 \xc2\xb0C (59 \xc2\xb0F) or excess humidity. To distinguish between different types of bloom, one can rub the surface of the chocolate lightly, and if the bloom disappears, it is fat bloom. Moving chocolate between temperature extremes, can result in an oily texture. Although visually unappealing, chocolate suffering from bloom is safe for consumption and taste unaffected.[76][77][78] Bloom can be reversed by retempering the chocolate or using it for any use that requires melting the chocolate.[79]\n\nChocolate is generally stored away from other foods, as it can absorb different aromas. Ideally, chocolates are packed or wrapped, and placed in proper storage with the correct humidity and temperature. Additionally, chocolate is frequently stored in a dark place or protected from light by wrapping paper. The glossy shine, snap, aroma, texture, and taste of the chocolate can show the quality and if it was stored well.[80]\n\nComposition\n\nNutrition\n\nA 100-gram serving of milk chocolate supplies 540 calories. It is 59% carbohydrates (52% as sugar and 3% as dietary fiber), 30% fat and 8% protein (table). Approximately 65% of the fat in milk chocolate is saturated, mainly palmitic acid and stearic acid, while the predominant unsaturated fat is oleic acid (table).\n\n100-grams of milk chocolate is an excellent source (over 19% of the Daily Value, DV) of riboflavin, vitamin B12 and the dietary minerals, manganese, phosphorus and zinc. Chocolate is a good source (10\xe2\x80\x9319% DV) of calcium, magnesium and iron.\n\nEffects on health\n\nChocolate may be a factor for heartburn in some people because one of its constituents, theobromine, may affect the esophageal sphincter muscle in a way that permits stomach acids to enter the esophagus.[81] Theobromine poisoning is an overdosage reaction to the bitter alkaloid, which happens more frequently in domestic animals than humans. However, daily intake of 50\xe2\x80\x93100 g cocoa (0.8\xe2\x80\x931.5 g theobromine) by humans has been associated with sweating, trembling and severe headache.[82] Chocolate contains alkaloids such as theobromine and phenethylamine, which have physiological effects in humans, but the presence of theobromine renders it toxic to some animals, including dogs and cats.[83]\n\nAccording to a 2005 study, the average lead concentration of cocoa beans is \xe2\x89\xa4 0.5 ng/g, which is one of the lowest reported values for a natural food.[84] However, during cultivation and production, chocolate may absorb lead from the environment (such as in atmospheric emissions of leaded gasoline, which is still being used in Nigeria).[84] Reports from 2014 indicate that ""chocolate might be a significant source"" of lead ingestion for children if consumption is high (with dark chocolate containing higher amounts),[85][86] and ""one 10 g cube of dark chocolate may contain as much as 20% of the daily lead oral limit.""[85]\n\nChocolate and cocoa contain moderate to high amounts of oxalate,[87][88] which may increase the risk of kidney stones.[89]\n\nA few studies have documented allergic reactions from chocolate in children.[81] Other research has shown that dark chocolate can aggravate acne in men who are prone to it.[90] Research has also shown that consuming dark chocolate does not substantially affect blood pressure.[40] Chocolate and cocoa are under preliminary research to determine if consumption affects the risk of certain cardiovascular diseases[91] or cognitive abilities.[92]\n\nOne tablespoonful (5 grams) of dry unsweetened cocoa powder has 12.1 mg of caffeine[93] and a 25-g single serving of dark chocolate has 22.4 mg of caffeine.[94] Although a single 7 oz. serving of coffee may contain 80\xe2\x80\x93175 mg,[95] studies have shown psychoactive effects in caffeine doses as low as 9 mg,[96] and a dose as low as 12.5 mg was shown to have effects on cognitive performance.[97]\n\nExcessive consumption of large quantities of any energy-rich food, such as chocolate, without a corresponding increase in activity to expend the associated calories, can cause weight gain and possibly lead to obesity.[81] Raw chocolate is high in cocoa butter, a fat which is removed during chocolate refining and then added back in varying proportions during the manufacturing process. Manufacturers may add other fats, sugars, and milk, all of which increase the caloric content of chocolate.[81]\n\nPhytochemicals\n\nIn comparison to most foods, cocoa contains more phenolic antioxidants.[98] Cocoa solids are a source of flavonoids[99] and alkaloids, such as theobromine, phenethylamine, and caffeine.[100]\n\nLabeling\n\nSome manufacturers provide the percentage of chocolate in a finished chocolate confection as a label quoting percentage of ""cocoa"" or ""cacao"". This refers to the combined percentage of both cocoa solids and cocoa butter in the bar, not just the percentage of cocoa solids.[101] The Belgian AMBAO certification mark indicates that no non-cocoa vegetable fats have been used in making the chocolate.[102][103] A long-standing dispute between Britain on the one hand and Belgium and France over British use of vegetable fats in chocolate ended in 2000 with the adoption of new standards which permitted the use of up to five percent vegetable fats in clearly labelled products.[104] This British style of chocolate has sometimes been pejoratively referred to as ""vegelate"".[104]\n\nChocolates that are organic[105] or fair trade certified[106] carry labels accordingly.\n\nIn the United States, some large chocolate manufacturers lobbied the federal government to permit confections containing cheaper hydrogenated vegetable oil in place of cocoa butter to be sold as ""chocolate"". In June 2007, in response to consumer concern about the proposal, the FDA reiterated ""Cacao fat, as one of the signature characteristics of the product, will remain a principal component of standardized chocolate.""[107]\n\nIndustry\n\nChocolate, prevalent throughout the world, is a steadily growing, US$50 billion-a-year worldwide business.[108] Europe accounts for 45% of the world\'s chocolate revenue,[109] and the US spent $20 billion in 2013.[110] Big Chocolate is the grouping of major international chocolate companies in Europe and the U.S. U.S. companies Mars and Hershey\'s alone generated $13 billion a year in chocolate sales and account for two-thirds of U.S. production in 2004.[111] Despite the expanding reach of the chocolate industry internationally, cocoa farmers and labourers in the Ivory Coast are unaware of the uses of the beans; the high cost of chocolate products in the Ivory Coast make it inaccessible to the majority of the population, who do not know what it tastes like.[112]\n\nManufacturers\n\nChocolate with various fillings\n\nChocolate manufacturers produce a range of products from chocolate bars to fudge. Large manufacturers of chocolate products include Cadbury (the world\'s largest confectionery manufacturer), Ferrero, Guylian, The Hershey Company, Lindt & Spr\xc3\xbcngli, Mars, Incorporated, Milka, Neuhaus and Suchard.\n\nGuylian is best known for its chocolate sea shells; Cadbury for its Dairy Milk and Creme Egg. The Hershey Company, the largest chocolate manufacturer in North America, produces the Hershey Bar and Hershey\'s Kisses.[113] Mars Incorporated, a large privately owned U.S. corporation, produces Mars Bar, Milky Way, M&M\'s, Twix, and Snickers. Lindt is known for its truffle balls and gold foil-wrapped Easter bunnies.\n\nFood conglomerates Nestl\xc3\xa9 SA and Kraft Foods both have chocolate brands. Nestl\xc3\xa9 acquired Rowntree\'s in 1988 and now markets chocolates under their brand, including Smarties (a chocolate candy) and Kit Kat (a chocolate bar); Kraft Foods through its 1990 acquisition of Jacobs Suchard, now owns Milka and Suchard. In February 2010, Kraft also acquired British-based Cadbury;[114] Fry\'s, Trebor Basset and the fair trade brand Green & Black\'s also belongs to the group.\n\nChild labor in cocoa harvesting\n\nThe widespread use of children in cocoa production is controversial, not only for the concerns about child labor and exploitation, but also because up to 12,000 of the 200,000 children working in C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire, the world\'s biggest producer of cocoa,[115] may be victims of trafficking or slavery.[116] Most attention on this subject has focused on West Africa, which collectively supplies 69 percent of the world\'s cocoa, and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire in particular, which supplies 35 percent of the world\'s cocoa. Thirty percent of children under age 15 in sub-Saharan Africa are child laborers, mostly in agricultural activities including cocoa farming.[118] Major chocolate producers, such as Nestl\xc3\xa9, buy cocoa at commodities exchanges where Ivorian cocoa is mixed with other cocoa.[119]\n\nIn 2009, Salvation Army International Development (SAID) UK stated that 12,000 children have been trafficked on cocoa farms in the Ivory Coast of Africa, where half of the world\'s chocolate is made.[120] SAID UK states that it is these child slaves who are likely to be working in ""harsh and abusive""[121] conditions for the production of chocolate,[120] and an increasing number of health-food[122] and anti-slavery[123] organisations are highlighting and campaigning against the use of trafficking in the chocolate industry.\n\nAs of 2017, approximately 2.1 million children in Ghana and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire were involved in farming cocoa, carrying heavy loads, clearing forests, and being exposed to pesticides.[5] According to Sona Ebai, the former secretary-general of the Alliance of Cocoa Producing Countries: ""I think child labor cannot be just the responsibility of industry to solve. I think it\'s the proverbial all-hands-on-deck: government, civil society, the private sector. And there, you need leadership.""[116] Reported in 2018, a 3-year pilot program \xe2\x80\x93 conducted by Nestl\xc3\xa9 with 26,000 farmers mostly located in C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire \xe2\x80\x93 observed a 51% decrease in the number of children doing hazardous jobs in cocoa farming.[4] The US Department of Labor formed the Child Labor Cocoa Coordinating Group as a public-private partnership with the governments of Ghana and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire to address child labor practices in the cocoa industry.[124] The International Cocoa Initiative involving major cocoa manufacturers established the Child Labor Monitoring and Remediation System intended to monitor thousands of farms in Ghana and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire for child labor conditions,[4][5] but the program reached less than 20% of the child laborers.[125] Despite these efforts, goals to reduce child labor in West Africa by 70% before 2020 are frustrated by persistent poverty, absence of schools, expansion of cocoa farmland, and increased demand for cocoa.[4][126]\n\nIn April 2018, the Cocoa Barometer report stated: ""Not a single company or government is anywhere near reaching the sector-wide objective of the elimination of child labor, and not even near their commitments of a 70% reduction of child labor by 2020"".[126]\n\nFair trade\n\nIn the 2000s, some chocolate producers began to engage in fair trade initiatives, to address concerns about the marginalization of cocoa laborers in developing countries. Traditionally, Africa and other developing countries received low prices for their exported commodities such as cocoa, which caused poverty to abound. Fairtrade seeks to establish a system of direct trade from developing countries to counteract this unfair system.[127] One solution for fair labor practices is for farmers to become part of an Agricultural cooperative. Cooperatives pay farmers a fair price for their cocoa so farmers have enough money for food, clothes, and school fees.[128] One of the main tenets of fair trade is that farmers receive a fair price, but this does not mean that the larger amount of money paid for fair trade cocoa goes directly to the farmers. The effectiveness of fair trade has been questioned. In a 2014 article, The Economist stated that workers on fair trade farms have a lower standard of living than on similar farms outside the fair trade system.[129]\n\nUsage and consumption\n\ns\'more topped with melted chocolate from a chocolate bar\n\nChocolate cake with chocolate frosting\n\nBars\n\nChocolate is sold in chocolate bars, which come in dark chocolate, milk chocolate and white chocolate varieties. Some bars that are mostly chocolate have other ingredients blended into the chocolate, such as nuts, raisins, or crisped rice. Chocolate is used as an ingredient in a huge variety of bars, which typically contain various confectionary ingredients (e.g., nougat, wafers, caramel, nuts, etc.) which are coated in chocolate.\n\nCoating and filling\n\nChocolate is used as a flavouring product in many desserts, such as chocolate cakes, chocolate brownies, chocolate mousse and chocolate chip cookies. Numerous types of candy and snacks contain chocolate, either as a filling (e.g., M&M\'s) or as a coating (e.g., chocolate-coated raisins or chocolate-coated peanuts).\n\nBeverages\n\nSome non-alcoholic beverages contain chocolate, such as chocolate milk, hot chocolate, chocolate milkshakes and tejate. Some alcoholic liqueurs are flavoured with chocolate, such as chocolate liqueur and creme de cacao. Chocolate is a popular flavour of ice cream and pudding, and chocolate sauce is a commonly added as a topping on ice cream sundaes. The caff\xc3\xa8 mocha is an espresso beverage containing chocolate.\n\nSee also\n\nReferences'";"Other";"801.txt-Other"

Its earliest use dates back to the Olmec civilization in Mesoamerica.\n\nThe next time you eat a piece of chocolate, you may not have to feel so guilty about it. Despite its bad reputation for causing weight gain, a number of health benefits may be associated with this delicious treat.\n\nShare on Pinterest Recent research suggests that chocolate may have some health benefits.\n\nChocolate receives a lot of bad press because of its high fat and sugar content. Its consumption has been associated with acne, obesity, high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, and diabetes.\n\nHowever, according to a review of chocolate\xe2\x80\x99s health effects published in the Netherlands Journal of Medicine, it\xe2\x80\x99s not all bad news.\n\nThe authors point to the discovery that cocoa, the key ingredient in chocolate, contains biologically active phenolic compounds.\n\nThis has changed people\xe2\x80\x99s views on chocolate, and it has stimulated research into how it might impact aging, and conditions such as oxidative stress, blood pressure regulation, and atherosclerosis.\n\nChocolate\xe2\x80\x99s antioxidant potential may have a range of health benefits. The higher the cocoa content, as in dark chocolate, the more benefits there are. Dark chocolate may also contain less fat and sugar, but it is important to check the label.\n\nEating chocolate may have the following benefits:\n\nlowering cholesterol levels\n\npreventing cognitive decline\n\nreducing the risk of cardiovascular problems\n\nIt is important to note that the possible health benefits mentioned below came from single studies. More research is needed to confirm that eating chocolate can really improve people\xe2\x80\x99s health.\n\nIn addition, chocolate bars do not contain only cocoa. The benefits and risks of any other ingredients, such as sugar and fat, need to be considered.\n\n1) Cholesterol\n\nOne study, published in The Journal of Nutrition, suggests that chocolate consumption might help reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, also known as \xe2\x80\x9cbad cholesterol.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe researchers set out to investigate whether chocolate bars containing plant sterols (PS) and cocoa flavanols (CF) have any effect on cholesterol levels.\n\nThe authors concluded: \xe2\x80\x9cRegular consumption of chocolate bars containing PS and CF, as part of a low-fat diet, may support cardiovascular health by lowering cholesterol and improving blood pressure.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n2) Cognitive function\n\nScientists at Harvard Medical School have suggested that drinking two cups of hot chocolate a day could help keep the brain healthy and reduce memory decline in older people.\n\nThe researchers found that hot chocolate helped improve blood flow to parts of the brain where it was needed.\n\nLead author, Farzaneh A. Sorond, said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs different areas of the brain need more energy to complete their tasks, they also need greater blood flow. This relationship, called neurovascular coupling, may play an important role in diseases such as Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nResults of a lab experiment, published in 2014, indicated that a cocoa extract, called lavado, might reduce or prevent damage to nerve pathways found in patients with Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s disease. This extract could help slow symptoms such as cognitive decline.\n\nAnother study, published in 2016 in the journal Appetite, suggests eating chocolate at least once weekly could improve cognitive function.\n\n3) Heart disease\n\nResearch published in The BMJ, suggests that consuming chocolate could help lower the risk of developing heart disease by one-third .\n\nBased on their observations, the authors concluded that higher levels of chocolate consumption could be linked to a lower risk of cardiometabolic disorders.\n\nThey call for further experimental studies to confirm whether consuming chocolate is beneficial.\n\n4) Stroke\n\nCanadian scientists, in a study involving 44,489 individuals, found that people who ate one serving of chocolate were 22 percent less likely to experience a stroke than those who did not. Also, those who had about two ounces of chocolate a week were 46 percent less likely to die from a stroke.\n\nA further study, published in the journal Heart in 2015, tracked the impact of diet on the long-term health of 25,000 men and women.\n\nThe findings suggested that eating up to 100 grams (g) of chocolate each day may be linked to a lower risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\n5) Fetal growth and development\n\nEating 30 g (about one ounce) of chocolate every day during pregnancy might benefit fetal growth and development, according to a study presented at the 2016 Pregnancy Meeting of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine in Atlanta, GA.\n\n6) Athletic performance\n\nShare on Pinterest Chocolate may help athletes cover more distance while using less oxygen.\n\nFindings published in The Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition suggest that a little dark chocolate might boost oxygen availability during fitness training.\n\nResearchers who studied cyclists doing time trials in the United Kingdom found that \xe2\x80\x9cAfter eating dark chocolate, the riders used less oxygen when cycling at a moderate pace and also covered more distance in a two-minute flat-out time trial.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe scientists believe that the success of dark chocolate in this case is that it contains flavonols known as epicatechins, which enhance the release of nitric oxide in the body.

"804.txt";"b'Chocolate is the most popular sweet treat in the world. People around the world (but mostly in Europe and the United States) consume more than 3 million tons of cocoa beans a year, according to the World Cocoa Foundation. And, not only does eating chocolate make you feel good, it may also be good for your heart and your brain.\n\nWhat is chocolate?\n\nChocolate is prepared from the fruit of the Theobroma cacao, a tropical tree whose name means ""food of the gods"" in Greek, according to ""Chocolate: Food of the Gods,"" an online exhibit by the Cornell University Library.\n\nTheobroma cacao trees are native to the Amazon and Orinoco river basins in South America. The trees are widely distributed from southeastern Mexico to the Amazon River. They thrive in hot, humid areas within about 20 degrees of the equator, according to Cornell. As the popularity of chocolate spread, growers established plantations in other regions, such as West Africa and South and Southeast Asia. Today, Ghana, C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire, Nigeria, Indonesia and Brazil account for 79 percent of the world\'s cacao production.\n\nCacao trees bear fruit that are about the same size and shape of a papaya, according to Patric Chocolate. These bumpy, lumpy berries, or pods, are full of up to 50 sour seeds, or beans, covered in white pulp.\n\nCacao seeds are harvested by hand because machines could injure the trees, according to Cornell. Workers remove the pods, which are orange when they are ripe, and open them with a machete. The seeds are placed in large fermentation trays that are stacked and covered in banana leaves, where they are left for two to seven days. Fermentation produces the chocolate flavor and aroma. It also destroys the seed\'s embryo, preventing unwanted germination, and causes the white pulp to fall away from the seeds.\n\nAfter fermenting, the beans dry out on sunny platforms. Workers turn them several times a day for three to five days to complete drying. The beans can dry faster in rotary driers but sun-dried beans taste the best, according to Cornell.\n\nNext, the beans are taken to the chocolate factory, where they are cleaned and debris is removed. The beans are roasted in large, rotating ovens. The roasting draws out flavor and removes the beans from their hulls. Roasted beans go into a winnowing machine, which cracks the beans and removes hulls. The remaining part of the bean is called the nib. Nibs become chocolate.\n\nThe nibs are ground down under a series of rollers. This process results in a thick paste called chocolate liquor. Chocolate liquor does not contain alcohol (however, chocolate liqueur does). It is the main source of unsweetened baking chocolate, according to Pam Williams, co-founder and past president of the Fine Chocolate Industry Association (FCIA) and founder and lead instructor of Ecole Cocolat Professional School of Chocolate Arts.\n\nAt this stage, the type of chocolate being produced is determined. According to the FCIA, ingredients separate fine chocolate from that of average quality. ""Fine chocolate,"" as designated by the FCIA, contains only cacao liquor, cacao butter (optional), sugar, lecithin, vanilla (optional) and possibly milk fats and solids. Additional flavors or ingredients like nuts can be added later.\n\n(Image credit: Dreamstime)\n\nTypes of chocolate\n\nFine chocolate falls into three categories: dark chocolate, milk chocolate and white chocolate, Williams said.\n\nDark chocolate has chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, lecithin, sugar and vanilla.\n\nMilk chocolate has all of the above plus milk fats and milk solids.\n\nWhite chocolate contains everything milk chocolate does except chocolate liquor.\n\nChocolatiers debate whether white chocolate is really chocolate. Until 2002, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration considered it a confectionary rather than chocolate because it does not contain chocolate liquor. The Hershey Food Corp. and the Chocolate Manufacturers Association petitioned the FDA, which added a standard of identity for white chocolate. Because the FDA refers to it as white chocolate, rather than confectionary, some experts, like Williams, accept white chocolate as chocolate.\n\nWithin the three categories, the FDA also acknowledges several grades, Williams said. They include unsweetened or brute, which can be up to 99 percent chocolate liquor; bittersweet; semisweet; and dark milk chocolate. The type of chocolate depends on what ingredients are present and the percentage of cocoa, in addition to where the beans are from and the way they are prepared.\n\nHealth benefits of chocolate\n\nGood heart food\n\nSeveral recent studies have examined the role that chocolate may have on heart health. Cacao beans are full of phytonutrients, which act as antioxidants and provide additional benefits. Furthermore, cacao beans are rich sources of iron, copper, magnesium, zinc and phosphorus, according to the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Dark chocolate contains two to three times more beneficial flavanols than milk chocolate because milk chocolate\'s cacao concentration is diluted with milk and possibly more sugar.\n\nWhile most studies have found some correlation between chocolate consumption and reduced risk of heart problems, the amount and type of chocolate needed requires further study. A 2017 meta-analysis of the effects of chocolate on coronary heart disease, stroke and diabetes published in the journal Nutrients concluded that the most benefit was associated with moderate chocolate intake. The authors found little benefit in heart disease or stroke reduction among people who consumed chocolate more than three times a week. Protective effects against diabetes emerged at two servings a week, but that benefit disappeared if people had more than six servings a week.\n\nOn the other hand, the findings of a large-scale study of more than 150,000 primarily male U.S. veterans who did not have coronary artery disease at the beginning of the study, suggest that eating an ounce of chocolate at least five times a week may help prevent the risk of coronary artery disease-related events like heart attack and heart failure.\n\nChocolate may also help prevent the development of atrial fibrillation, a type of irregular heartbeat that increases the risk of heart failure, stroke and more. A study, published in the journal Heart in 2017, found that adults who ate chocolate at least once a month had 10 to 20 percent lower rates of developing atrial fibrillation than those who never or rarely ate chocolate.\n\nGood brain food\n\nChocolate may be good for the brain. Some studies have focused on chocolate\'s ability to improve cognitive function. A study published in the Journal of Alzheimer\'s Disease in 2016 found that chocolate consumption might lower the risk of cognitive decline in older people. The study looked at nearly 400 Portuguese citizens over age 65 and saw that those who ate a moderate amount of chocolate \xe2\x80\x94 on average, one chocolate snack a week; the study did not differentiate between milk and dark chocolate \xe2\x80\x94 decreased their risk of cognitive decline by 40 percent over two years. Those who ate more chocolate, or those who had more caffeine, saw fewer cognitive benefits.\n\nGood mood food\n\nChocolate is often associated with positive effects on mood, but the reasons why it makes some people feel good are debatable. Chocolate contains substances that stimulate the brain in the same way cannabis does, such as anandamines, and substances that have similar effects as amphetamine, such as tyramine and phenylethylamine, according to the Dartmouth Undergraduate Journal of Science. However, these substances are in very low concentrations \xe2\x80\x94 too low to induce an antidepressant effect.\n\nChocolate may interact with neurotransmitter systems that contribute to appetite, reward and mood regulation, such as dopamine, serotonin and endorphins, according to the 2013 article in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology. However, the authors noted, the effects may have more to do with chocolate\'s taste and smell than its chemical effects.\n\nA 2010 study published in Archives of Internal Medicine found a link between depression and chocolate consumption. The results showed that people who scored high on a screening test for depression consumed more chocolate than those who weren\'t considered depressed. However, the study pointed out that there is only a link, and cannot explain why. Since the participants were not followed over time, the researchers don\'t know whether eating chocolate ameliorates or amplifies a sad mood. The possibilities are many \xe2\x80\x94 from using chocolate as a sort of natural Prozac to the idea that chocolate might have some role in driving depression.\n\nHealth risks of eating chocolate\n\nLike many foods, chocolate is healthiest when eaten in moderation. The sugars and fats that are added to chocolate make it high in calories, which may lead to weight gain. Furthermore, many of the protective effects that chocolate may offer might be mitigated by overconsumption.\n\nHistory of chocolate\n\nScientists debate how long humans have been using and consuming cacao beans. Chocolate\'s history goes back at least 2,000 years, while historians Sophie and Michael Coe, authors of ""The True History of Chocolate"" (Thames and Hudson, 2013), suggest that it might go back four millennia. The word chocolate can be traced back to the Aztec word ""xocoatl,"" the name for a bitter drink made from cacao beans. This was the way chocolate was consumed until the Spanish conquistadors came to Central America.\n\nIn several pre-Columbian Latin American societies, cacao beans were used as currency, according to Smithsonian magazine. Mayans and Aztecs believed the beans had mystical properties and used them during important rituals. When the Spanish arrived, sweetened chocolate came into existence. Legend has it that the Aztec king Montezuma gave conquistador Hern\xc3\xa1n Cort\xc3\xa9s a bitter chocolate drink, which he said was disgusting. But Cort\xc3\xa9s\' men added cane sugar and honey to it and took it back to Spain, where it quickly became popular.\n\nChocolate was a fashionable drink for rich Europeans throughout the 18th century. The Industrial Revolution allowed chocolate to be mass-produced and brought the treat to the masses. The popularity led to the development of cacao tree plantations.\n\nEnslaved people farmed most of the plantations. Initially, Spanish colonizers forced Mesoamericans to farm the cacao plantations, according to ""The Biography of Chocolate"" (Crabtree Publishing Co., 2005), by Adrianna Morganelli. When the indigenous peoples began to die in large numbers from diseases brought by Europeans, enslaved Africans were brought over to make up the labor shortage. In addition to sugarcane, indigo and other crops, enslaved Africans planted, maintained and harvested cacao trees throughout the Caribbean, Central and South America to feed the new European taste for chocolate.\n\nIn 1815, Dutch physicist Coenraad Van Houten experimented with removing varied amounts of the cocoa butter from chocolate liquor, according to Cornell University. This led to the creation of cocoa powder and soon solid chocolate.\n\nIn 1847, a Bristol, England, chocolate company, Fry\'s, created the first mass-produced chocolate bar when Joseph Fry added additional cocoa butter to Van Houten\'s chocolate, which turned it into a moldable paste, according to Bristol Museums. Milk chocolate was invented soon after with the help of Henri Nestl\xc3\xa9, who went on to found the major food company that bears his name. Major European chocolate brands Lindt and Cadbury also got their start in the 1800s; Rodolphe Lindt invented the conching machine, which gives chocolate a velvety texture.\n\nMass chocolate consumption hit the United States in the late 1800s when Milton S. Hershey began selling chocolate-coated caramels. He then developed his own formula for milk chocolate, purchased chocolate factory equipment and introduced mass-produced chocolate bars and other shapes, like Hershey\'s Kisses, in 1900.\n\nIn 1923, the Mars Co. developed the Milky Way bar by putting nougat inside a chocolate bar. That same year, former Hershey employee H.B. Reese introduced Reese\'s Peanut Butter Cups, which later became part of the Hershey brand.\n\nAs the years progressed, chocolate concoctions from both small and large producers became increasingly innovative. In September 2017, Swiss chocolate company Barry Callebaut introduced ruby chocolate. Ruby chocolate comes from isolating specific compounds in cocoa beans, according to Confectionary News. That, along with a modified processing technique, results in a rosy pink chocolate that has a sweet but sour berry taste and no traditional chocolate flavor, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. Other colored chocolates are made from dyed white chocolate.\n\nThreats to chocolate\n\nChocolate production is threatened by climate change. According to a 2016 report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the primary cacao-producing countries of C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire, Ghana, and Indonesia will experience a 2.1 degree Celsius (3.7 degrees Fahrenheit) increase in temperature by 2050. Rainfall will not rise along with the temperature, causing lowered humidity levels. As a result, viable land for cacao production will significantly shrink. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\'s Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability report, 89.5 percent of the 294 chocolate-producing locations studied would become less suitable by 2050.\n\nFarmers and scientists are working to develop strategies to maintain chocolate production. Some farmers are planting taller trees next to cacao trees to increase shade and decrease moisture loss, according to the NOAA. Cacao plantations may also move to higher elevations with cooler temperatures and greater rainfall.\n\nGenetic scientists are taking a different approach. A January 2018 press release from the Innovative Genomics Institute announced a project to develop disease-resistant cacao. Condensing cacao plantations because of climate change could increase the spread of disease. The project will use CRISPR DNA-editing technology to make a heartier cacao seed.\n\nEthics of chocolate production\n\nAccording to Slave Free Chocolate, 2.3 million children work in chocolate production in Ghana and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire, where they are vulnerable to trafficking, slavery and other violent labor practices. The International Labor Rights Forum reports that these children are often exposed to chemicals, work long hours and are denied education. According to Epicure and Culture, many children are sold into slavery and never see their families again. Others are kidnapped.\n\nThough the Harkin-Engel Protocol of 2001 was designed to stop child labor in the chocolate industry, according to the CNN Freedom Project, little has changed. The deadlines for action have been repeatedly pushed back.\n\nConsumers who want ethical chocolate should look for certifications designating Fair Trade, Rain Forest Alliance, UTZ, and Fair for Life, according to Slave Free Chocolate\xe2\x80\x99s guide to chocolate companies.\n\nChocolate production can also harm the environment. Farmers often clear forests to make room for cacao plantations. According to the World Wildlife Fund, about 70 percent of C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire\'s illegal deforestation is related to cacao farming. One danger of deforestation is soil erosion, which can make land less fertile for cacao plants, creating a vicious cycle, according to Confectionary News.\n\nAdditional resources'";"Other";"804.txt-Other"

The Maya considered chocolate to be the food of the gods, held the cacao tree to be sacred, and buried dignitaries with bowls of chocolate.\n\nFull Article\n\nchocolate , food product made from cocoa beans , consumed as candy and used to make beverages and to flavour or coat various confections and bakery products. Rich in carbohydrates , it is an excellent source of quick energy, and it also contains minute amounts of the stimulating alkaloids theobromine and caffeine .\n\nHistory of chocolate\n\nThe cacao tree was cultivated more than 3,000 years ago by the Maya, Toltec, and Aztec peoples, who prepared a beverage from its fruit, the cocoa bean (sometimes using it as a ceremonial drink) and also used the bean as a currency. The Maya considered chocolate to be the food of the gods, held the cacao tree to be sacred, and even buried dignitaries with bowls of the substance (along with other items deemed useful in the afterlife). In fact, the identification of the (Olmec-originated) word ka-ka-w (\xe2\x80\x9ccacao\xe2\x80\x9d) inscribed on those containers was key to deciphering the Maya\xe2\x80\x99s phonetic manner of writing.\n\nSpain was the earliest European country to incorporate chocolate into its cuisine, but exactly how that happened is vague. It is known that Christopher Columbus took cocoa beans to Spain after his fourth voyage in 1502, though little was made of it at that time. It has been commonly thought (though there appears to be no evidence) that in 1519 Montezuma II, the Aztec ruler of Mexico, served a bitter cocoa-bean drink to the Spanish conquistador Hern\xc3\xa1n Cort\xc3\xa9s, who subsequently introduced the drink to Spain. A strong possibility is that chocolate first arrived in Spain in 1544 with representatives of the Kekch\xc3\xad Mayan people of Guatemala, who came bearing gifts (including chocolate) to visit the court of Prince Philip. However, it was not until 1585 that the first recorded shipment of cocoa beans arrived in Spain from Veracruz, Mexico. Sweetened and flavoured with cinnamon and vanilla, chocolate was served as a hot beverage and became quite popular in the Spanish court. It was many years before chocolate had its introduction to France, England, and beyond.\n\nengraving of an Aztec with cocoa beans and chocolate beverage \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican with his chocolate pot and goblet,\xe2\x80\x9d an engraving of an Aztec with cocoa beans and chocolate beverage, from a French history of chocolate, tea, and coffee, 1685. From Traitez Nouveaux and curieux du caf\xc3\xa9 du th\xc3\xa9 et du chocolate, by Philippe Sylvestre Dufour, 1685\n\nIn 1657 a Frenchman opened a shop in London at which solid chocolate for making the beverage could be purchased at 10 to 15 shillings per pound. At that price only the wealthy could afford to drink it, and there appeared in London, Amsterdam, and other European capitals fashionable chocolate houses, some of which later developed into famous private clubs. In London many chocolate houses were used as political party meeting places as well as high-stakes gambling spots, notably Cocoa-Tree Chocolate-House (later the Cocoa-Tree Club), which opened in 1698, and White\xe2\x80\x99s, which was opened by Francis White in 1693 as White\xe2\x80\x99s Chocolate-House. About 1700 the English improved chocolate by the addition of milk. The reduction of the cost of the beverage was hampered in Great Britain by the imposition of high import duties on the raw cocoa bean, and it was not until the mid-19th century, when the duty was lowered to a uniform rate of one penny per pound, that chocolate became popular.\n\nMeanwhile, the making of chocolate spread overseas and grew in sophistication. Chocolate manufacture started in the American colonies in 1765 at Dorchester, Massachusetts, using beans brought in by New England sea captains from their voyages to the West Indies. James Baker financed the first mill, which was operated by an Irish immigrant, John Hanan. Waterpower was used for grinding the beans. In the Netherlands in 1828, C.J. van Houten patented a process for pressing much of the fat, or cocoa butter, from ground and roasted cocoa beans and thus obtaining cocoa powder. In 1847 the English firm of Fry and Sons combined cocoa butter with chocolate liquor and sugar to produce sweet (eating) chocolate\xe2\x80\x94the base of most chocolate confectionary\xe2\x80\x94and in 1876 Daniel Peter of Switzerland added dried milk to make milk chocolate.

"810.txt";"b'Share on Pinterest Screen Moment/Stocksy United Dark chocolate is loaded with nutrients that can positively affect your health. Made from the seed of the cacao tree, it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the best sources of antioxidants you can find. Studies show that dark chocolate can improve your health and lower the risk of heart disease. This article reviews 7 health benefits of dark chocolate or cocoa that are supported by science.\n\n1. Very nutritious If you buy quality dark chocolate with a high cocoa content, then it\xe2\x80\x99s quite nutritious. It contains a decent amount of soluble fiber and is loaded with minerals. A 100-gram bar of dark chocolate with 70\xe2\x80\x9385% cocoa contains (1): 11 grams of fiber\n\n67% of the DV for iron\n\n58% of the DV for magnesium\n\n89% of the DV for copper\n\n98% of the DV for manganese In addition, it has plenty of potassium, phosphorus, zinc, and selenium. Of course, 100 grams (3.5 ounces) is a fairly large amount and not something you should be consuming daily. These nutrients also come with 600 calories and moderate amounts of sugar. For this reason, dark chocolate is best consumed in moderation. The fatty acid profile of cocoa and dark chocolate is also good. The fats consist mostly of oleic acid (a heart-healthy fat also found in olive oil), stearic acid, and palmitic acid. The stearic acid has a neutral effect on body cholesterol. Palmitic acid can raise cholesterol levels, but it only makes up one-third of the total fat calories. Dark chocolate also contains stimulants like caffeine and theobromine, but it\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely to keep you awake at night, as the amount of caffeine is very small compared with coffee. Summary Quality dark chocolate is rich in fiber, iron, magnesium, copper, manganese, and a few other minerals.\n\n2. Powerful source of antioxidants ORAC stands for oxygen radical absorbance capacity. It\xe2\x80\x99s a measure of the antioxidant activity of foods. Basically, researchers set a bunch of free radicals (bad) against a sample of a food and see how well the antioxidants in the food can disarm the free radicals. The biological relevance of ORAC values is questioned, as it\xe2\x80\x99s measured in a test tube and may not have the same effect in the body. However, it\xe2\x80\x99s worth mentioning that raw, unprocessed cocoa beans are among the highest-scoring foods that have been tested. Dark chocolate is loaded with organic compounds that are biologically active and function as antioxidants. These include polyphenols, flavanols and catechins, among others. One study showed that cocoa and dark chocolate had more antioxidant activity, polyphenols, and flavanols than any other fruits tested, which included blueberries and acai berries (2). Summary Cocoa and dark chocolate have a wide variety of powerful antioxidants. In fact, they have way more than most other foods.\n\n3. May improve blood flow and lower blood pressure The flavanols in dark chocolate can stimulate the endothelium, the lining of arteries, to produce nitric oxide (NO) ( 3 ). One of the functions of NO is to send signals to the arteries to relax, which lowers the resistance to blood flow and therefore reduces blood pressure. Many controlled studies show that cocoa and dark chocolate can improve blood flow and lower blood pressure, though the effects are usually mild ( 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ). However, one study in people with high blood pressure showed no effect, so take this with a grain of salt ( 8 ). Given the great variation between studies on this subject, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that more research is needed ( 9 , 10). Summary The bioactive compounds in cocoa may improve blood flow in the arteries and cause a small but statistically significant decrease in blood pressure.\n\n4. Raises HDL and protects LDL from oxidation Consuming dark chocolate can improve several important risk factors for heart disease. In a controlled study, cocoa powder was found to significantly decrease oxidized LDL (bad) cholesterol in men. It also increased HDL and lowered total LDL for those with high cholesterol ( 11 ). Oxidized LDL means that the LDL cholesterol has reacted with free radicals. This makes the LDL particle itself reactive and capable of damaging other tissues, such as the lining of the arteries in your heart. It makes perfect sense that cocoa lowers oxidized LDL. It contains an abundance of powerful antioxidants that do make it into the bloodstream and protect lipoproteins against oxidative damage ( 12 , 13 , 14 ). The flavanols in dark chocolate can also reduce insulin resistance, which is another common risk factor for diseases like heart disease and diabetes ( 15 , 16 , 17 ). However, dark chocolate also contains sugar, which can have the opposite effect. Summary Dark chocolate improves several important risk factors for disease. It lowers the susceptibility of LDL to oxidative damage while increasing HDL and improving insulin sensitivity.\n\n5. May reduce heart disease risk The compounds in dark chocolate appear to be highly protective against the oxidation of LDL. In the long term, this should cause much less cholesterol to lodge in the arteries, resulting in a lower risk of heart disease. In fact, several long-term observational studies show a fairly drastic improvement. In a study of 470 older men, cocoa was found to reduce the risk of death from heart disease by 50% over 15 years ( 18 ). Another study revealed that eating chocolate two or more times per week lowered the risk of having calcified plaque in the arteries by 32%. Eating chocolate less frequently had no effect ( 19 ). Yet another study showed that eating dark chocolate more than five times per week lowered the risk of heart disease by 57% ( 20 ). A 2017 clinical trial found that subjects who consumed almonds with or without dark chocolate showed improved LDL cholesterol levels (21). Of course, these four studies are observational, so it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear exactly if it was the chocolate that reduced the risk. However, since the biological process is known (lower blood pressure and oxidized LDL), it\xe2\x80\x99s plausible that regularly eating dark chocolate may reduce the risk of heart disease. Summary Observational studies show a drastic reduction in heart disease risk among those who consume the most chocolate.\n\n6. May protect your skin from the sun The bioactive compounds in dark chocolate may also be great for your skin. The flavanols can protect against sun damage, improve blood flow to the skin, and increase skin density and hydration ( 22 ). The minimal erythemal dose (MED) is the minimum amount of UVB rays required to cause redness in the skin 24 hours after exposure. In one study of 30 people, the MED more than doubled after consuming dark chocolate high in flavanols for 12 weeks ( 23 ). If you\xe2\x80\x99re planning a beach vacation, consider enjoying some extra dark chocolate in the prior weeks and months. But check with your doctor or dermatologist before forgoing your normal skin care routine in favor of more dark chocolate. Summary Studies show that the flavanols from cocoa can improve blood flow to the skin and protect it from sun damage.\n\n7. Could improve brain function The good news isn\xe2\x80\x99t over yet. Dark chocolate may also improve the function of your brain. One study of healthy volunteers showed that eating high flavanol cocoa for 5 days improved blood flow to the brain ( 24 ). Cocoa may also significantly improve cognitive function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment. It may improve verbal fluency and several risk factors for disease, as well ( 25 ). Additionally, cocoa contains stimulant substances like caffeine and theobromine, which may be a key reason why it can improve brain function in the short term ( 26 ). Summary Cocoa or dark chocolate may improve brain function by increasing blood flow. It also contains stimulants like caffeine and theobromine.'";"Other";"810.txt-Other"
"817.txt";"b'When most of us hear the word chocolate, we picture a bar, a box of bonbons, or a bunny. The verb that comes to mind is probably ""eat,"" not ""drink,"" and the most apt adjective would seem to be ""sweet."" But for about 90 percent of chocolate\'s long history, it was strictly a beverage, and sugar didn\'t have anything to do with it.\n\n""I often call chocolate the best-known food that nobody knows anything about,"" said Alexandra Leaf, a self-described ""chocolate educator"" who runs a business called Chocolate Tours of New York City.\n\nThe terminology can be a little confusing, but most experts these days use the term ""cacao"" to refer to the plant or its beans before processing, while the term ""chocolate"" refers to anything made from the beans, she explained. ""Cocoa"" generally refers to chocolate in a powdered form, although it can also be a British form of ""cacao.""\n\nEtymologists trace the origin of the word ""chocolate"" to the Aztec word ""xocoatl,"" which referred to a bitter drink brewed from cacao beans. The Latin name for the cacao tree, Theobroma cacao, means ""food of the gods.""\n\nMany modern historians have estimated that chocolate has been around for about 2000 years, but recent research suggests that it may be even older.\n\nIn the book The True History of Chocolate, authors Sophie and Michael Coe make a case that the earliest linguistic evidence of chocolate consumption stretches back three or even four millennia, to pre-Columbian cultures of Mesoamerica such as the Olmec.\n\nLast November, anthropologists from the University of Pennsylvania announced the discovery of cacao residue on pottery excavated in Honduras that could date back as far as 1400 B.C.E. It appears that the sweet pulp of the cacao fruit, which surrounds the beans, was fermented into an alcoholic beverage of the time.\n\n""Who would have thought, looking at this, that you can eat it?"" said Richard Hetzler, executive chef of the caf\xc3\xa9 at the Smithsonian\'s National Museum of the American Indian, as he displayed a fresh cacao pod during a recent chocolate-making demonstration. ""You would have to be pretty hungry, and pretty creative!""\n\nIt\'s hard to pin down exactly when chocolate was born, but it\'s clear that it was cherished from the start. For several centuries in pre-modern Latin America, cacao beans were considered valuable enough to use as currency. One bean could be traded for a tamale, while 100 beans could purchase a good turkey hen, according to a 16th-century Aztec document.\n\nBoth the Mayans and Aztecs believed the cacao bean had magical, or even divine, properties, suitable for use in the most sacred rituals of birth, marriage and death. According to Chloe Doutre-Roussel\'s book The Chocolate Connoisseur, Aztec sacrifice victims who felt too melancholy to join in ritual dancing before their death were often given a gourd of chocolate (tinged with the blood of previous victims) to cheer them up. Sweetened chocolate didn\'t appear until Europeans discovered the Americas and sampled the native cuisine. Legend has it that the Aztec king Montezuma welcomed the Spanish explorer Hernando Cortes with a banquet that included drinking chocolate, having tragically mistaken him for a reincarnated deity instead of a conquering invader. Chocolate didn\'t suit the foreigners\' tastebuds at first \xe2\x80\x93one described it in his writings as ""a bitter drink for pigs"" \xe2\x80\x93 but once mixed with honey or cane sugar, it quickly became popular throughout Spain. By the 17th century, chocolate was a fashionable drink throughout Europe, believed to have nutritious, medicinal and even aphrodisiac properties (it\'s rumored that Casanova was especially fond of the stuff). But it remained largely a privilege of the rich until the invention of the steam engine made mass production possible in the late 1700s. In 1828, a Dutch chemist found a way to make powdered chocolate by removing about half the natural fat (cacao butter) from chocolate liquor, pulverizing what remained and treating the mixture with alkaline salts to cut the bitter taste. His product became known as ""Dutch cocoa,"" and it soon led to the creation of solid chocolate. The creation of the first modern chocolate bar is credited to Joseph Fry, who in 1847 discovered that he could make a moldable chocolate paste by adding melted cacao butter back into Dutch cocoa. By 1868, a little company called Cadbury was marketing boxes of chocolate candies in England. Milk chocolate hit the market a few years later, pioneered by another name that may ring a bell \xe2\x80\x93 Nestle. In America, chocolate was so valued during the Revolutionary War that it was included in soldiers\' rations and used in lieu of wages. While most of us probably wouldn\'t settle for a chocolate paycheck these days, statistics show that the humble cacao bean is still a powerful economic force. Chocolate manufacturing is a more than 4-billion-dollar industry in the United States, and the average American eats at least half a pound of the stuff per month. In the 20th century, the word ""chocolate"" expanded to include a range of affordable treats with more sugar and additives than actual cacao in them, often made from the hardiest but least flavorful of the bean varieties (forastero). But more recently, there\'s been a ""chocolate revolution,"" Leaf said, marked by an increasing interest in high-quality, handmade chocolates and sustainable, effective cacao farming and harvesting methods. Major corporations like Hershey\'s have expanded their artisanal chocolate lines by purchasing smaller producers known for premium chocolates, such as Scharffen Berger and Dagoba, while independent chocolatiers continue to flourish as well. ""I see more and more American artisans doing incredible things with chocolate,"" Leaf said. ""Although, I admit that I tend to look at the world through cocoa-tinted glasses.""'";"Other";"817.txt-Other"

"823.txt";"b'Is Chocolate Good for Your Heart?\n\nWhy a little, in moderation, may be beneficial\n\nChocolate has gotten a lot of media coverage in recent years because it\'s believed that it may help protect your cardiovascular system. The reasoning being that the cocoa bean is rich in a class of plant nutrients called flavonoids.\n\nFlavonoids help protect plants from environmental toxins and help repair damage. They can be found in a variety of foods, such as fruits and vegetables. When we eat foods rich in flavonoids, it appears that we also benefit from this ""antioxidant"" power.\n\nAntioxidants are believed to help the body\'s cells resist damage caused by free radicals that are formed by normal bodily processes, such as breathing, and from environmental contaminants, like cigarette smoke. If your body does not have enough antioxidants to combat the amount of oxidation that occurs, it can become damaged by free radicals. For example, an increase in oxidation can cause low-density lipoprotein (LDL), also known as ""bad"" cholesterol, to form plaque on the artery walls.\n\nFlavanols are the main type of flavonoid found in cocoa and chocolate. In addition to having antioxidant qualities, research shows that flavanols have other potential influences on vascular health, such as lowering blood pressure, improving blood flow to the brain and heart, and making blood platelets less sticky and able to clot.\n\nThese plant chemicals aren\xe2\x80\x99t only found in chocolate. In fact, a wide variety of foods and beverages are rich in flavonols. These include cranberries, apples, peanuts, onions, tea and red wine.\n\nAre all types of chocolate healthy?\n\nBefore you grab a chocolate candy bar or slice of chocolate cake, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand that not all forms of chocolate contain high levels of flavanols.\n\nCocoa naturally has a very strong, pungent taste, which comes from the flavanols. When cocoa is processed into your favorite chocolate products, it goes through several steps to reduce this taste. The more chocolate is processed (through things like fermentation, alkalizing, roasting, etc.), the more flavanols are lost.\n\nMost commercial chocolates are highly processed. Although it was once believed that dark chocolate contained the highest levels of flavanols, recent research indicates that, depending on how the dark chocolate was processed, this may not be true. The good news is that most major chocolate manufacturers are looking for ways to keep the flavanols in their processed chocolates. But for now, your best choices are likely dark chocolate over milk chocolate (especially milk chocolate that is loaded with other fats and sugars) and cocoa powder that has not undergone Dutch processing (cocoa that is treated with an alkali to neutralize its natural acidity).\n\nWhat about all of the fat in chocolate?\n\nYou may be surprised to learn that chocolate isn\xe2\x80\x99t as bad for you as once believed.\n\nThe fat in chocolate comes from cocoa butter and is made up of equal amounts of oleic acid (a heart-healthy monounsaturated fat also found in olive oil), stearic and palmitic acids. Stearic and palmitic acids are forms of saturated fat. You may know that saturated fats are linked to increases in LDL cholesterol and the risk of heart disease.\n\nBut, research shows that stearic acid appears to have a neutral effect on cholesterol, neither raising nor lowering it. Although palmitic acid does affect cholesterol levels, it only makes up one-third of the fat calories in chocolate. Still, this does not mean you can eat all the dark chocolate you\xe2\x80\x99d like.\n\nFirst, be careful about the type of dark chocolate you choose: chewy caramel-marshmallow-nut-covered dark chocolate is by no means a heart-healthy food option. Watch out for those extra ingredients that can add lots of extra fat and calories. Second, there is currently no established serving size of chocolate to help you reap the cardiovascular benefits it may offer, and more research is needed in this area. However, we do know that you no longer need to feel guilty if you enjoy a small piece of dark chocolate once in a while.\n\nSo, for now, enjoy moderate portions of chocolate (e.g., 1 ounce) a few times per week, and don\xe2\x80\x99t forget to eat other flavonoid-rich foods like apples, red wine, tea, onions and cranberries.'";"Other";"823.txt-Other"

"830.txt";"b""Originally consumed as a bitter drink, it was prized as both an aphrodisiac and an energy booster.\n\nMankind\xe2\x80\x99s love affair with chocolate stretches back more than five millennia. Produced from the seeds of tropical cacao trees native to the rainforests of Central and South America, chocolate was long considered the \xe2\x80\x9cfood of the gods,\xe2\x80\x9d and later, a delicacy for the elite. But for most of its history, it was actually consumed as a bitter beverage rather than the sweet, edible treat it has become worldwide.\n\nWhat Is the Birthplace of Chocolate?\n\nMayan cacao drink Ren Photo/Getty Images\n\nArchaeologists have discovered the earliest traces of cacao in pottery used by the ancient Mayo-Chinchipe culture 5,300 years ago in the upper Amazon region of Ecuador. Chocolate played an important political, spiritual and economic role in ancient Mesoamerican civilizations, which ground roasted cacao beans into a paste that they mixed with water, vanilla, chili peppers and other spices to brew a frothy chocolate drink.\n\nAncient Mesoamericans believed chocolate was an energy booster and aphrodisiac with mystical and medicinal qualities. The Mayans, who considered cacao a gift from the gods, used chocolate for sacred ceremonies and funeral offerings. Wealthy Mayans drank foaming chocolate drinks, while commoners consumed chocolate in a cold porridge-like dish.\n\nAs people of the Aztec empire spread across Mesoamerica in the 1400s, they too began to prize cacao. Since they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t grow it in the dry highlands of central Mexico, they traded with the Mayans for the beans, which they even used as currency. (In the 1500s, Aztecs could purchase a turkey hen or a hare for 100 beans.) By one account, the 16th-century Aztec ruler Moctezuma II drank 50 cups of chocolate a day out of a golden goblet to increase his libido.\n\nWATCH: Season 1 of The Food That Built America without signing in now.\n\nSpaniards Introduce Chocolate to Europe\xe2\x80\x99s Elite\n\nChocolate arrived in Europe during the 1500s, likely brought by both Spanish friars and conquistadors who had traveled to the Americas. Although the Spanish sweetened the bitter drink with cane sugar and cinnamon, one thing remained unchanged: Chocolate reigned as a delectable symbol of luxury, wealth and power\xe2\x80\x94an expensive import sipped by royal lips, and affordable only to Spanish elites.\n\nChocolate\xe2\x80\x99s popularity eventually spread to other European courts, where aristocrats consumed it as a magic elixir with health benefits. To slake their growing thirst for chocolate, European powers established colonial plantations in equatorial regions around the world to grow cacao and sugar. When diseases brought by Europeans depleted the native Mesoamerican labor pool, African slaves were imported to the Americas to work on the plantations and maintain chocolate production.\n\nChocolate remained an aristocratic nectar until the 1828 invention of the cocoa press revolutionized its production. Attributed in varying accounts to either Dutch chemist Coenraad Johannes van Houten or his father, Casparus, the cocoa press squeezed the fatty butter from roasted cacao beans, leaving behind a dry cake that could be pulverized into a fine powder that could be mixed with liquids and other ingredients, poured into molds and solidified into edible, easily digestible chocolate. The cocoa press ushered in the modern era of chocolate by enabling it to be used as a confectionary ingredient, and the resulting drop in production costs made chocolate much more affordable.\n\nREAD MORE: Why the Candy Bar Market Exploded After WWI\n\nChocolate Becomes a Treat for the Masses\n\n10 Gallery 10 Images\n\nIn 1847, British chocolate company J.S. Fry & Sons created the first edible chocolate bar from cocoa butter, cocoa powder and sugar. Rival chocolatier Cadbury\xe2\x80\x99s, credited with pioneering the Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day chocolate box and chocolate Easter egg, followed suit soon after and in 1854 earned a royal warrant as purveyors of chocolate to Queen Victoria.\n\nIt was in Switzerland that chocolate production took one of its greatest leaps forward. In the 1870s, Swiss chocolatier Daniel Peter utilized a powdered milk developed several years earlier by his neighbor Henri Nestl\xc3\xa9 to produce the first milk chocolate bar, and the pair eventually formed the Nestl\xc3\xa9 Company. Swiss chocolatier Rodolphe Lindt\xe2\x80\x99s 1879 invention of the conching machine\xe2\x80\x94which used large stone rollers to mix and aerate chocolate to give it a velvety texture and superior taste\xe2\x80\x94allowed for the mass production of smooth, creamy milk chocolate.\n\nIn the United States, Milton Hershey pioneered the assembly-line production of milk chocolate. After selling his caramel candy company for $1 million and producing his first milk chocolate bar in 1900, Hershey bought farmland near his birthplace in rural Pennsylvania and built an entire factory town devoted to chocolate. The grass-fed Holsteins on the surrounding dairy farms supplied the company\xe2\x80\x99s milk, and a company town in Cuba supplied its sugar.\n\nREAD MORE: How Hershey's Chocolate Helped Power Allied Troops in WWII\n\nChocolate bars soared in popularity during the Roaring Twenties.

Father-and-son duo Frank C. Mars and Forrest Mars Sr. collaborated on the idea for the Milky Way bar, which hit the market in 1923 with the chocolate for its coating supplied by Hershey\xe2\x80\x99s. The family-owned business would rival Hershey\xe2\x80\x99s, and Forrest Mars Sr. later partnered with the son of a Hershey\xe2\x80\x99s executive to begin production of M&M candies in 1941.\n\nH.B.

"858.txt";"b'Cocoa butter composition\n\nPrior to any refining, the fatty-acid composition of the CB used in this study was determined by gas-liquid chromatography. The CB used in this study is mainly composed of stearic acid (37.3%), palmitic acid (25.4%), and oleic acid (33.5%) (Supplementary Table 1), which closely matches typical literature values4. The phosphorus content of the unrefined CB is 88 \xc2\xb1 1 ppm, or 0.263 \xc2\xb1 0.004% equivalent phosphatides by weight (Supplementary Table 2), which is similar to the 0.34 \xc2\xb1 0.07% reported by Arruda and Dimick6. After refining, the phospholipids are completely removed from the CB. The FFA content of the unrefined CB is 1.65 \xc2\xb1 0.01% (as oleic acid) (Supplementary Table 3), which complies with the requirement of having <1.75% FFAs as oleic acid in Codex standards. This is reduced to 0.06% after neutralization and bleaching.\n\nCrystal structure and polymorphism\n\nPowder X-ray diffraction is the most unambiguous method for determining CB TAG polymorphism. In this study, CB samples were melted at 80 \xc2\xb0C for 30 min to clear the memory of crystallization and then crystallized statically at 23 \xc2\xb0C in an incubator for 1 day. Form IV displays wide-angle reflections corresponding to short spacings of 4.35, 4.15, 3.97, and 3.81 \xc3\x85, Form V has short spacings of 4.58, 3.98, 3.87, 3.75, and 3.67 \xc3\x85, while Form VI has short spacings of 4.59, 3.86, and 3.70 \xc3\x8510. Unrefined CB displays reflections corresponding to short spacings of 4.61, 3.88, and 3.71 \xc3\x85, which is characteristic of Form VI, matching literature values closely (Fig. 1; Supplementary Table 4)10. Additionally, the small-angle reflections corresponding to long spacings of 68.16 and 32.89 \xc3\x85 further suggest a Form VI polymorphism and a 3 L structure (polytype)11. CB TAGs in Forms V and VI stack as lamellae in the [001] direction with a dimension, which is proportional to three fatty-acid chain lengths, hence the nomenclature \xe2\x80\x9c3 L\xe2\x80\x9d. Other polymorphic forms stack as 2 L structures, the more common polytypic arrangement12.\n\nFig. 1: Powder X-ray diffraction patterns and differential scanning calorimetric traces (inset) of unrefined native CB, refined CB, and refined CB with added minor lipidic components. Samples included a unrefined native CB, b refined CB, c refined CB with added 0.1% (w/w) dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, and d refined CB with added 0.1% (w/w) dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine. Samples were crystallized statically at 23 \xc2\xb0C for 24 h. Full size image\n\nIn contrast, the refined CB sample displays a pattern that resembles a blend of Forms IV and V. Short spacings of 4.35 and 4.18 \xc3\x85 agree with literature values for Form IV, while 4.60, 3.99, 3.88, and 3.77 \xc3\x85 match those of Form V11. Furthermore, the long spacings include both 2 L (45.20 \xc3\x85) and 3 L (65.57 and 32.69 \xc3\x85) arrangements, indicative of the presence of Forms IV and V, respectively11. Thus, it appears that the removal of minor components in CB through refining drastically changes the crystal structure of CB.\n\nThe wide-angle region of powder XRD spectra of refined CB with minor components added back is generally characteristic of Form V, or a blend of Forms IV and V (Fig. 1c, d and Supplementary Fig. 1 (a\xe2\x80\x93f)). In the small-angle region, diffraction patterns suggest that the 3 L structure is present in all samples. Long spacings in the range 64\xe2\x80\x9368 \xc3\x85 correspond to the reflections of the (001) crystal plane. Higher-order reflections, up to ones corresponding to the (009) plane of this lamellar crystal, are also evident. However, there is also varying amounts of the 2 L structure present in the various samples, specifically Form IV, which imparts undesirable properties and stability to CB and chocolate, including a low melting point and excessive softness12. The DMPC, GMP, GMO, and FFA samples have little to no 2 L structure present, indicated by the lack of a (001) plane reflection corresponding to ~45 \xc3\x85. In contrast, DPPE and GMS CB samples display a strong 2 L reflection, suggesting a mixture of 2 L and 3 L structures.\n\nMelting point and enthalpy of fusion\n\nThe melting points and enthalpies of fusion determined by DSC were compared across the CB samples and are shown in Table 1. Example DSC curves are presented for each sample in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2. Wille and Lutton reported the melting temperatures for Forms I through VI as 17.3, 23.3. 25.5, 27.5, 33.9, and 36.3 \xc2\xb0C10, while Lovegren et al.13 reported lower melting temperatures for the same six polymorphs as 13, 20, 23, 25, 30, and 33.5 \xc2\xb0C. The melting point of the unrefined CB used in our study closely matches that of Form VI, as reported by Willie and Lutton10. However, once the CB is refined, the melting point drops to 28.8 \xc2\xb0C, indicative of Form IV. After adding specific minor components back into the refined CB, the melting temperature increases again. Phospholipid and MAG addition to refined CB yield samples with melting points in the range of 29.8\xe2\x80\x9332.2 \xc2\xb0C, suggesting that the CB crystals are in transition from Form IV to Form V, as reported by Wille and Lutton10. Finally, when FFAs are added to refined CB, the melting temperature increases back to about 34 \xc2\xb0C, which may indicate a mixture of Forms V and VI, as it is also similar to Form VI\xe2\x80\x99s melting point of 33.5 \xc2\xb0C13. These results are all in agreement with the XRD data.\n\nTable 1 Melting point and enthalpy of fusion of unrefined native CB, refined CB, and refined CB with added minor lipidic components. Full size table\n\nThe enthalpies of fusion follow a similar trend, with a higher enthalpy of fusion (143.9 J/g) for unrefined CB, which decreases significantly after refining (110.9 J/g). Again, the phospholipids and MAGs have a much smaller effect, if any, compared to the FFAs. With the FFA samples, the enthalpies of fusion are similar to that of the unrefined CB. Guthrie reported an enthalpy of 147 J/g for Form V CB, which decreased for less stable forms14.\n\nCrystallization kinetics\n\nThe crystallization kinetics of the CB samples were quantified using half-times derived from the Avrami model fitted to the SFC-temperature data, as shown in Fig. 2, with the calculated Avrami constants shown in Supplementary Table 515.\n\nFig. 2: Static crystallization growth curve of unrefined native CB, refined CB, and refined CB with added minor lipidic components crystallized at 23 \xc2\xb0C (symbols) and corresponding fits to the Avrami model (solid lines). The inset table indicates the half-times of crystallization derived form model fits. Refining CB accelerates its crystallization (a), as does 0.1% (w/w) phospholipid addition (b). Addition of 0.5% (w/w) saturated monoacylglycerols, glycerol monostearate, and glycerol monopalmitate, do not significantly affect crystallization kinetics, while addition of the unsaturated glycerol monooletate does (c). Free fatty-acid addition to refined CB at 0.5% (w/w) levels accelerates crystallization for stearic, palmitic, and oleic acids equally (d). Values represent means and standard errors of three replicates and values with the same superscript letter are not significantly different (P > 0.05). Full size image\n\nUnrefined CB has the longest half-time of crystallization at 281.9 min, which decreases to 202.3 min after refining. Statistically significant decreases (P < 0.05) in the half time of crystallization of unrefined CB are observed after addition of DMPC, DPPE, GMO, and all free fatty acids tested, including palmitic, stearic, and oleic acids. Chaiseri and Dimick reported that different phospholipids had different effects on crystallization rate, with certain phospholipids such as lysophosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol retarding nucleation, while others such as phosphatidylcholine promoting nucleation. They also highlighted that removing phospholipids through refining decreased the crystallization rate, indicating that phospholids may be necessary as initial crystallization seeds in CB1. This agrees with the data presented in this study, with the addition of phospholipids increasing crystallization rate. Arruda and Dimick reported a much higher relative concentration of phospholipids in seed crystals than in bulk CB, with the majority being phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine6. Thus, it appears that the added phospholipids may aid in the nucleation of CB TAGs.\n\nThe FFA and GMO CB samples have a slightly shorter half-time of crystallization relative to the refined CB sample, but the effects of palmitic and oleic acid are not statistically significant (P > 0.05). M\xc3\xbcller and Careglio focused their study specifically on FFAs, and reported slower crystal growth of unrefined CB with added stearic, palmitic, and oleic acids7. However, we do not observe this in our study. Chaiseri and Dimick reported that saturated free fatty acids increased the crystallization rate in the early stages of CB crystallization1.\n\nFew studies have been conducted on the effect of MAGs on CB crystallization. Chaiseri and Dimick suggested that their effects are small due to their low concentration in CB1. In our study, GMS and GMP, both saturated monoglycerides, do not significantly affect CB crystallization kinetics. Surprisingly, the unsaturated monoglyceride GMO enhances CB crystallization.\n\nPolarized light microscopy\n\nLight microscopy revealed subtle differences in the microstructure of the different CB samples (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 3). Although all images display feather-like spherulitic structures, the unrefined sample has smaller spherulites. DPPE addition, interestingly, leads to the formation of larger spherulites with a different texture than upon DMPC addition. The spherulites of the refined and DPPE samples display granular structures in the centre of the spherulites and feather-like crystallites in the periphery. The MAG samples all exhibit similar crystal morphologies, with both granular structures and small feather-like spherulites present. This is similar to the stearic and palmitic acid samples, though the FFA samples display a more granular structure. It appears that the MAG and FFA samples, excluding the oleic acid sample, revert the CB to the morphology of the unrefined sample. However, the oleic acid sample differs greatly from the rest, displaying large spherulites analogous to the refined CB sample.\n\nFig. 3: Polarized light microscopy images of unrefined native CB, refined CB, and refined CB with and without added minor lipidic components. Samples included a unrefined native CB, b refined CB, c refined CB with added 0.1% (w/w) dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, and d refined CB with added 0.1% (w/w) dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine. Samples were crystallized statically at 23 \xc2\xb0C for 24 h. Intensity and contrast were auto-levelled. Full size image\n\nAn aspect that became clear during the microscopy studies is that the spatial distribution of mass of CB is affected by the refining process and subsequent addition of minor lipidic components. One way to quantify this spatial distribution of mass is by determining the box-counting fractal dimension (D box ) of the images. A high fractal dimension is associated with a greater fill of the available embedding space with crystalline mass, as well as a higher order in the distribution of this crystalline mass. The box-counting fractal dimension provides a value that quantifies the level of space-filling, as well as self-similarity within a structure, which can be related to the nucleation process of CB. Supplementary Table 6 lists these values. The unrefined and stearic acid samples have the lowest average fractal dimension, with D box = 1.63 and 1.62, respectively. In contrast, the sample with the highest fractal dimension is the refined sample at D box = 1.75, followed by the phospholipid samples at ~1.72. Samples with a higher fractal dimension are expected to have originated from a higher nucleation rate, as this leads to more homogenous growth across an area. On the other hand, slower nucleation rates would result in more heterogeneous growth, leading to a lower fractal dimension for the resulting mass distribution 16.\n\nInterestingly, here we also discovered a statistically significant (r = 0.77, P < 0.01) inverse correlation between the melting temperature of the samples and their fractal dimension, as shown in Fig. 4. This may be related to the polymorphism of each sample and its corresponding nucleation process. For the unrefined sample, a high melting temperature of 36.4 \xc2\xb0C indicates the presence of the Form VI polymorph. The higher free energy of nucleation for this most stable polymorph results in low nucleation rates, leading to a more heterogeneous mass distribution and a lower fractal dimension. Conversely, the lower melting temperature of the refined sample suggests a mixture of Forms IV and V, which are metastable polymorphs. These polymorphic forms have greater rates of nucleation, resulting in a more homogeneous mass distribution and a higher fractal dimension16.\n\nFig. 4: Global relationship between the box-counting fractal dimension (D box ) of polarized light microscopy images of CB samples and their corresponding melting temperature (T m ). Fractal dimension values plotted represent the means of six images, while melting temperature values plotted represent the means of three replicates. Full size image\n\nMechanical properties\n\nThe hardness of both CB and chocolate samples containing some of the minor components was determined by 3-point bending, and the elastic bending modulus calculated. The elastic bending moduli (E B ) of unrefined CB, refined CB, and DMPC CB are 44.1 \xc2\xb1 3.4, 35.4 \xc2\xb1 4.4, and 39.0 \xc2\xb1 3.7 N/mm2, respectively. There is no statistically significant difference between these values (P > 0.05). The melting temperatures for these samples are the same as well, with the average being 34.3 \xc2\xb1 0.1 \xc2\xb0C.\n\nFor the chocolate samples, the addition of phospholipids to molten commercial chocolate (90% cocoa solids) allows the chocolate to maintain hardness without complex tempering procedures, such as crystallization at 5 \xc2\xb0C for 1 h and subsequent storage at 20 \xc2\xb0C for 4 days. Other trials with static crystallization at 23 and 26 \xc2\xb0C yield chocolates with undesirable mechanical and surface properties, suggesting that the use of phospholipids to promote proper tempering still requires some optimization of crystallization temperatures. DMPC and DPPE were added chocolate at 0.1% (w/w) levels, and their properties were compared to commercial chocolate both directly from the package and recrystallized under the same conditions as the doped samples (Table 2). The E B is similar between the commercial chocolate and the phospholipid-containing samples, but is significantly lower for the recrystallized commercial chocolate (P < 0.05). When the chocolate is melted and recrystallized without any additive addition, it becomes much softer. A greater E B indicates a stiffer chocolate, relating to the property of snap, which is desirable in chocolate. However, DSC analysis revealed that all the chocolate samples have similar melting temperatures, all indicative of Form V CB crystals. XRD patterns further confirm the presence of Form V CB crystals in all samples (Fig. 5). Thus, it appears that the polymorphism of CB in chocolate does not wholly determine its mechanical properties, and these mechanical properties may be attributed to the microstructure instead.\n\nTable 2 Elastic bending modulus (E B ), melting temperature, and whiteness index (WI) of commercial chocolate samples with added phospholipids. Full size table\n\nFig. 5: Powder X-ray diffraction patterns for commercial chocolate with added minor lipidic components. Chocolate samples were molten, blended with the minor components and crystallized at 5 \xc2\xb0C for 1 h, followed by 20 \xc2\xb0C for 4 days. The a commercial chocolate, b molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate, c molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added 0.1% (w/w) dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, and d molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added 0.1% (w/w) dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine, all display powder X-ray diffraction patterns characteristic of well-tempered \xce\xb2 2 , triclinic, Form V cocoa butter crystals. This crystal form displays a strong reflection corresponding to a short spacing of ~4.6 \xc3\x85 in the wide-angle diffraction region, and characteristic wide-angle reflections in the 2\xce\xb8 region 20\xe2\x80\x9325\xc2\xb0. In the small-angle diffraction region, only reflections from the 3 L (001) plane corresponding to ~62\xe2\x80\x9363-\xc3\x85 were observed. The absence of reflections from (001) plane of the 2 L polytype indicates the formation of the optimal polytypic form in the cocoa butter in all samples. Reflections at higher angles in the small-angle region correspond to higher-order reflections for these two crystal planes. Full size image\n\nProper chocolate tempering typically focuses on the melting behavior of the chocolate, in other words, the polymorphism of the chocolate\xe2\x80\x99s CB triacylglycerol crystals2,3. However, there is little consideration for the microstructure and mechanical properties when determining whether chocolate has been properly tempered or not. Here we show that addition of DMPC and DPPE helps achieve the desired hardness and fracture properties in chocolate, without directly impacting the polymorphism. This likely results from changes in the microstructure of the underlying CB fat crystal network, which arises from the phospholipids affecting the nucleation behavior of the CB.\n\nSurface reflectance\n\nProper tempering of chocolate results in a smooth surface with high surface gloss17. Bloom, for example, is often characterized by the appearance of a grayish white film on the surface of chocolate, attributed to the uncontrolled polymorphic transformation from Form V to Form VI18. This white appearance is due to the presence of large surface crystals, which scatter light impinging upon them19. This can be quantified using the Whiteness Index (WI), calculated from RGB surface color measurements17. A higher WI indicates a greater level of fat bloom on the surface of the chocolate, or may also indicate a rougher surface. The WI for each of the chocolate samples is shown in Table 2. The commercial chocolate and the DMPC chocolate sample have similar WI, suggesting a properly tempered chocolate for the DMPC sample. Moreover, a statistically significant difference is evident between the DMPC chocolate sample and the recrystallized commercial chocolate sample (P < 0.05), which was not tempered properly. The lower WI of the DMPC chocolate sample suggests that the addition of this phospholipid aided in the stability of the chocolate, resulting in less fat bloom and/or a smoother surface compared to the recrystallized commercial chocolate sample. The effect of DPPE addition to molten and recrystallized chocolate is not as clear since the WI is not statistically different from the commercial, DMPC or molten and recrystallized chocolates.\n\nChocolate microstructure by synchrotron-based micro-computed tomography (SR-\xc2\xb5CT)\n\nSynchrotron \xc2\xb5CT analysis revealed similarities between chocolate microstructure among all samples imaged at a <450 \xc2\xb5m length scale. CT voxel intensity is directly proportional to material density. The number of voxels with a given intensity is then representative of the number of volume fractions with a given density in the analyzed volume. The molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate sample (Lindt-R) displays the largest difference between samples, with a narrowing and shift of the histogram compared to the fresh commercial chocolate (Lindt-F), molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added DMPC, and molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added DPPE. This indicates a difference in material structure upon recrystallization. This is visually represented in volume renderings where the most notable difference is a reduction in the green intensity for Lindt-R, compared to the Lindt-F, DMPC, and DPPE samples, as seen in Fig. 6. Volume rendering movies of each sample can be seen in the corresponding links in Fig. 6.\n\nFig. 6: Volume renderings of reconstructed slices, plotted histograms, and correlation matrix of SR-\xc2\xb5CT data. Samples included a molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added 0.1% (w/w) dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC), Supplementary Movie 1; b molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added 0.1% (w/w) dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DPPE), Supplementary Movie 2; c fresh commercial chocolate (Lindt-F), Supplementary Movie 3; d molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate (Lindt-R), Supplementary Movie 4; e plotted histograms, and f correlation matrix. Full size image\n\nA comparison of the histograms shows qualitative differences in the overall density distributions, which make up the sample volumes in the images. A correlation matrix was generated by inputting the voxel count values for each binned 16-bit gray-value and generating a table of correlation coefficients between the four chocolates density distributions. The correlation matrices show a high positive correlation in the material\xe2\x80\x99s density distribution regardless of treatment; however, the least variance is observed between DMPC vs. Lindt-F and DPPE vs. Lindt-F. The highest correlation coefficient is found between DMPC and fresh Lindt, and DPPE vs. fresh Lindt samples, with a value of 0.9987. This suggests that the complex microstructure of Lindt chocolate with added DMPC and DPPE and crystallized isothermally, is more similar to that of tempered fresh Lindt chocolate than without these additives.\n\nOverall, we find that the presence of various minor components within CB results in major changes to its polymorphism, crystallization kinetics, and crystal morphology. By refining CB through neutralization and bleaching, the unrefined CB transitioned from Form VI to a blend of Forms IV and V, in addition to displaying faster crystal growth. Although adding MAGs and FFAs back into refined CB results in some small differences, phospholipid addition has the largest impact.\n\nAt 0.1% (w/w) levels, DMPC and DPPE both significantly increase the crystal growth rate of refined CB. However, the DPPE sample exhibits significant amounts of the 2 L polytype, while the DMPC sample only displays 3 L polytypism, which is the more stable and preferred nanostructure. When added to a commercial chocolate sample, DMPC and DPPE both template the Form V polymorph with optimal mechanical properties, surface gloss and microstructure. This may allow for the production of chocolate products without the need for laborious and complex tempering protocols.\n\nProper tempering is often judged by the resulting melting temperature, a function of the CB polymorphic form2. However, as we show in this study, the various chocolate samples were all in Form V as determined by DSC and XRD analysis, but display different mechanical properties. This suggests that there is more to tempering than achieving the Form V polymorph, and important qualities such as gloss and snap may be heavily dependent on surface and bulk microstructure. Thus, DMPC, DPPE, and possibly other saturated phospholipids can potentially be employed as effective additives for engineering the crystallization behavior, polymorphism, nanostructure, and microstructure in CB and chocolate products.'";"Other";"858.txt-Other"
"866.txt";"b'Is chocolate toxic to dogs?\n\nYes, chocolate is toxic to dogs. While rarely fatal, chocolate ingestion can result in significant illness. Chocolate is toxic because it contains a chemical called theobromine, as well as caffeine. Theobromine is the main toxin in chocolate and is very similar to caffeine. Both chemicals are used medicinally as a diuretic, heart stimulant, blood vessel dilator, and a smooth muscle relaxant. Dogs cannot metabolize theobromine and caffeine as well as people can. That is why dogs are more sensitive to the chemicals\xe2\x80\x99 effects.\n\nHow much chocolate is poisonous to a dog?\n\nThe amount of toxic theobromine varies with the type of chocolate. The darker and more bitter the chocolate, the more dangerous it is to dogs. Baking chocolate and gourmet dark chocolate are highly concentrated and contain 130-450 mg of theobromine per ounce. Common milk chocolate only contains about 44-58 mg/ounce. White chocolate rarely poses any threat of chocolate poisoning with only 0.25 mg of theobromine per ounce of chocolate. Even if the amount ingested is not a toxicity concern, dogs can still become ill from the fat and sugar in chocolate. These can cause pancreatitis in severe cases or in dogs that have more sensitive stomachs. To put this in perspective, a medium-sized dog weighing 50 pounds would only need to eat 1 ounce of baker\'s chocolate, or 9 ounces of milk chocolate, to potentially show signs of poisoning. For many dogs, ingesting small amounts of milk chocolate is not harmful.\n\nWhat are the clinical signs of chocolate poisoning?\n\nClinical signs depend on the amount and type of chocolate ingested. For many dogs, the most common clinical signs are vomiting, diarrhea, increased thirst, panting or restlessness, excessive urination, and racing heart rate. In severe cases, symptoms can include muscle tremors, seizures, and heart failure. Complications such as developing aspiration pneumonia from vomiting, can make the prognosis for chocolate poisoning worse. When in doubt, immediate treatment by your veterinarian is recommended if a poisonous amount of chocolate is ingested.\n\n""Clinical signs of chocolate poisoning can take hours to develop and last for days.""\n\nClinical signs of chocolate poisoning can take several hours to develop. Signs due to large exposures can last for days due to the long half-life of theobromine. This means that it remains in the bloodstream for a longer period. Theobromine may be re-absorbed from the bladder, so intravenous fluids and frequent walks to encourage urination may be necessary. It is important to seek medical attention by calling your veterinarian or Pet Poison Helpline as soon as you suspect that your dog has eaten chocolate.\n\nWhat should I do if my dog eats chocolate?\n\nContact your veterinarian or Pet Poison Helpline to see if a poisonous amount of chocolate was ingested. If a toxic amount is ingested, you should have your dog examined by a veterinarian immediately. The sooner treatment begins, the better your dog\'s prognosis.\n\nWhat is the treatment for chocolate poisoning?\n\nTreatment depends on the amount and type of chocolate eaten. If treated early, decontamination including inducing vomiting and administering activated charcoal to prevent absorption of theobromine into the body may be all that is necessary. Treatments of activated charcoal may be repeated to reduce the continued resorption and recirculation of theobromine.\n\nIt is very common to provide supportive treatments such as intravenous fluid therapy to help stabilize a dog and promote theobromine excretion. All dogs ingesting a toxic amount of chocolate should be closely monitored for any signs of agitation, vomiting, diarrhea, nervousness, irregular heart rhythm, and high blood pressure. Medication to treat restlessness and other signs may also be necessary\n\nI saw a treat made for dogs that contains chocolate. Isn\'t this dangerous?\n\nMany gourmet dog treats use carob as a chocolate substitute.\n\n""Carob looks similar to chocolate and the two are often confused.""\n\nCarob looks similar to chocolate and the two are often confused. Some specialty dog bakeries will use a small amount of milk chocolate in treats. Since the amount of theobromine is typically low, this may be safe for most dogs. However, most veterinarians recommend that you avoid giving your dog chocolate in any form.\n\nPet Poison Helpline, an animal poison control center based out of Minneapolis, MN is available 24/7 for pet owners and veterinary professionals that require assistance treating a potentially poisoned pet. The staff provides treatment advice for poisoning cases of all species, including dogs, cats, birds, small mammals, large animals and exotic species. As the most cost-effective option for animal poison control care, Pet Poison Helpline\xe2\x80\x99s fee of $65 per incident includes follow-up consultations for the duration of the poison case.

In chocolate, crystalline forms of cocoa butter triglycerides (TAGs) are what give the food its characteristic shine, smooth texture, brittleness, and melting point.\n\nNot just any crystalline structure will do, either. Of the six distinct configurations of this class of molecule known to exist, Form V is the one that gives us a perfect temper.\n\nTempering \xe2\x80\x93 transforming the diverse mix of molecules into something that resists your bite while feeling heavenly smooth on your tongue \xe2\x80\x93 is a culinary process that has been gradually perfected over time, relying on a fine-tuned sequence of heating, mixing, and cooling.\n\nWhile researchers have investigated the influence TAG composition has on the success of tempering, little is known about how minor components of cocoa butter might make or break the process, including things like free fatty acids and phospholipids.\n\nGiven they make up just a few percent of the chemicals in cocoa butter, differences in their origins and refining might significantly alter the make-up of this key ingredient, either by helping the right crystals generate or interfering with their growth.\n\nPrevious research hinted at roles certain minor components had in the formation of the 'seed' crystals. For example, having a lot of free fatty acids seems to poison the crystallization process. Phospholipids, on the other hand, appeared to help them grow.\n\nTo nail down the precise proportions and chemical nature of these components, the researchers analyzed the exact make-up of a sample of cocoa butter, varying its composition by adding ingredients or bleaching out existing ones.\n\nThey then subjected it to a variety of tests to determine how variations in fat content might affect the growth time and proportion of crystal types, as well as things like melting point, surface reflection, micro-structure, and flex.\n\nWhile the amount of molecules such as free fatty acids had some effect, the real game-changer was the proportion of phospholipids, specifically saturated phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. Don't let the tongue-twister names fool you, though: these are garden variety biological molecules found in the membranes of living cells.\n\nBoth of these molecules in higher concentrations saw to the formation of Form V crystals, giving the cocoa butter the optimal glass, micro-structure, and mechanical properties.\n\nAdding the right amount of each to chocolate just might take the anxiety out of the tempering process, either by simplifying it or even eliminating it altogether.\n\nThis won't necessarily turn all of us into home kitchen dessertiers. But for professionals relying on recipes they can count on, knowing a little more about the chemistry of their chocolate creations just might give them the formula they need.\n\nThis research was published in Nature Communications.""";"Other";"893.txt-Other"

I had been wanting something sweet and since it was so hot outside, I decided I wanted ice cream. At the store, I saw the talenti pints of gelato and thought, ""how cute, I can reuse these."" I chose the coffee chocolate chip and I\'m so glad I did. It is creamy, has a full coffee flavor, and the chips are so thin and small they just melt away. I normally dislike chips in my frozen treats, but like I said, these just melted away nicely. My husband chose a the Belgian chocolate flavor and we were both disappointed with it compared to the coffee one. I ended up having to share mine with him which was fine since it is so rich I could only eat a little at a time.\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by DoctorEsq from Outstanding I have never been a coffee lover. Yes, in today\'s coffee addicted world that\'s strange but there you have it. I am, however, a tried and true Chocoholic. Yet the way Talenti has blended traditional coffee flavor with chocolate chips is truly outstanding. And the texture is perfect ~ a bit more solid then the other chocolate chip flavors especially in contrast to the Mediterranean Mint, Chocolate Chip, Peppermint Bark, etc ~ although all yummy, they melt far to quickly for my taste as I enjoy savoring the experience!! True, I pretty much love just about all the Talenti flavors and eat 1/2 a pint every night for my treat. But Talenti\'s Coffee Chocolate Chip has become one of my favorite flavors!\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by Auditory from This is what coffee flavor is all about In the mid-1960s when I was just a tot, my Sisters used to take me to a little shack that doubled as an ice cream parlor. The place featured a big name ice cream brand that is still one of the major players today. That\'s where I had my first taste of a coffee flavored frozen confection. Regrettably, the band name product today tastes nothing like I remembered it to have been. Fortunately, Talenti gelato has made that memory come back to life. With every spoonful, there is no guessing where the flavor is. Talenti has crafted a frozen dessert with an uncompromisingly strong coffee flavor that punches the tastebuds every time.\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by Kath12 from Delicious! My favorite ice cream flavor since I was young was Mocha. That flavor has disappeared. One night my daughter brought over brownies with a complimentary Talenti flavor. I fell in love with this gelato. Next time I went shopping I decided to buy the coffee with the chocolate chips. The first spoonful brought back the flavor I had longer for. It is now my nightly treat. All I need is 2-3 tablespoons full and I am totally satisfied until the next night. Sometimes I will mix it with one of your vanilla flavors & it is so yummy! No longer am I searching for this delicious flavor. I am totally hooked on Talenti brand gelato. I have enjoyed every flavor so far & I still have many more to try.\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by Baddie13 from Great Ice Cream This ice cream is delicious and is a great blend. I can taste the coffee and chocolate chips great together.\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by Mina from My life is now complete I was having a miserable day and I saw this in the store. Not much of a coffee person unless it\'s loaded with chocolate. Tried this as one of those what-the-hey-I\'ll-give-it-a-try moments and that first taste? [Insert angels singing here] DE-LOVIN-LICIOUS!!! The perfect amount of coffee taste, a ton of chocolate chips so no spoonful is left wanting, and my day got infinitely better after I downed half the jar in five minutes. Perfection in a jar. My only problem is trying to make it last before I can buy more! Yum yum yummy yummy yum! :D\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by best one so far from Best one so far Previous flavors I tried were super hard to open because they spilled gelato on the edge, making it extremely difficult to open. These were finally clean so it was easy to open. That was the first major PLUS in my book. Then I tried the gelato and was so impressed. It\'s the best coffee flavor I\'ve ever tasted. It\'s bolder than any other coffee flavored brands I\'ve tried so far. Normally I don\'t like ""stuff"" in my ice cream/gelato, but the ""chips"" in this one is more like shavings so it\'s not as noticeable (unlike their Double Dark Chocolate gelato which has chucks of chips). Best flavor so far from Talenti.'";"Other";"894.txt-Other"

"9.txt";"b'Share on Pinterest Screen Moment/Stocksy United Dark chocolate is loaded with nutrients that can positively affect your health. Made from the seed of the cacao tree, it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the best sources of antioxidants you can find. Studies show that dark chocolate can improve your health and lower the risk of heart disease. This article reviews 7 health benefits of dark chocolate or cocoa that are supported by science.\n\n1. Very nutritious If you buy quality dark chocolate with a high cocoa content, then it\xe2\x80\x99s quite nutritious. It contains a decent amount of soluble fiber and is loaded with minerals. A 100-gram bar of dark chocolate with 70\xe2\x80\x9385% cocoa contains (1): 11 grams of fiber\n\n67% of the DV for iron\n\n58% of the DV for magnesium\n\n89% of the DV for copper\n\n98% of the DV for manganese In addition, it has plenty of potassium, phosphorus, zinc, and selenium. Of course, 100 grams (3.5 ounces) is a fairly large amount and not something you should be consuming daily. These nutrients also come with 600 calories and moderate amounts of sugar. For this reason, dark chocolate is best consumed in moderation. The fatty acid profile of cocoa and dark chocolate is also good. The fats consist mostly of oleic acid (a heart-healthy fat also found in olive oil), stearic acid, and palmitic acid. The stearic acid has a neutral effect on body cholesterol. Palmitic acid can raise cholesterol levels, but it only makes up one-third of the total fat calories. Dark chocolate also contains stimulants like caffeine and theobromine, but it\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely to keep you awake at night, as the amount of caffeine is very small compared with coffee. Summary Quality dark chocolate is rich in fiber, iron, magnesium, copper, manganese, and a few other minerals.\n\n2. Powerful source of antioxidants ORAC stands for oxygen radical absorbance capacity. It\xe2\x80\x99s a measure of the antioxidant activity of foods. Basically, researchers set a bunch of free radicals (bad) against a sample of a food and see how well the antioxidants in the food can disarm the free radicals. The biological relevance of ORAC values is questioned, as it\xe2\x80\x99s measured in a test tube and may not have the same effect in the body. However, it\xe2\x80\x99s worth mentioning that raw, unprocessed cocoa beans are among the highest-scoring foods that have been tested. Dark chocolate is loaded with organic compounds that are biologically active and function as antioxidants. These include polyphenols, flavanols and catechins, among others. One study showed that cocoa and dark chocolate had more antioxidant activity, polyphenols, and flavanols than any other fruits tested, which included blueberries and acai berries (2). Summary Cocoa and dark chocolate have a wide variety of powerful antioxidants. In fact, they have way more than most other foods.\n\n3. May improve blood flow and lower blood pressure The flavanols in dark chocolate can stimulate the endothelium, the lining of arteries, to produce nitric oxide (NO) ( 3 ). One of the functions of NO is to send signals to the arteries to relax, which lowers the resistance to blood flow and therefore reduces blood pressure. Many controlled studies show that cocoa and dark chocolate can improve blood flow and lower blood pressure, though the effects are usually mild ( 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ). However, one study in people with high blood pressure showed no effect, so take this with a grain of salt ( 8 ). Given the great variation between studies on this subject, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that more research is needed ( 9 , 10). Summary The bioactive compounds in cocoa may improve blood flow in the arteries and cause a small but statistically significant decrease in blood pressure.\n\n4. Raises HDL and protects LDL from oxidation Consuming dark chocolate can improve several important risk factors for heart disease. In a controlled study, cocoa powder was found to significantly decrease oxidized LDL (bad) cholesterol in men. It also increased HDL and lowered total LDL for those with high cholesterol ( 11 ). Oxidized LDL means that the LDL cholesterol has reacted with free radicals. This makes the LDL particle itself reactive and capable of damaging other tissues, such as the lining of the arteries in your heart. It makes perfect sense that cocoa lowers oxidized LDL. It contains an abundance of powerful antioxidants that do make it into the bloodstream and protect lipoproteins against oxidative damage ( 12 , 13 , 14 ). The flavanols in dark chocolate can also reduce insulin resistance, which is another common risk factor for diseases like heart disease and diabetes ( 15 , 16 , 17 ). However, dark chocolate also contains sugar, which can have the opposite effect. Summary Dark chocolate improves several important risk factors for disease. It lowers the susceptibility of LDL to oxidative damage while increasing HDL and improving insulin sensitivity.\n\n5. May reduce heart disease risk The compounds in dark chocolate appear to be highly protective against the oxidation of LDL. In the long term, this should cause much less cholesterol to lodge in the arteries, resulting in a lower risk of heart disease. In fact, several long-term observational studies show a fairly drastic improvement. In a study of 470 older men, cocoa was found to reduce the risk of death from heart disease by 50% over 15 years ( 18 ). Another study revealed that eating chocolate two or more times per week lowered the risk of having calcified plaque in the arteries by 32%. Eating chocolate less frequently had no effect ( 19 ). Yet another study showed that eating dark chocolate more than five times per week lowered the risk of heart disease by 57% ( 20 ). A 2017 clinical trial found that subjects who consumed almonds with or without dark chocolate showed improved LDL cholesterol levels (21). Of course, these four studies are observational, so it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear exactly if it was the chocolate that reduced the risk. However, since the biological process is known (lower blood pressure and oxidized LDL), it\xe2\x80\x99s plausible that regularly eating dark chocolate may reduce the risk of heart disease. Summary Observational studies show a drastic reduction in heart disease risk among those who consume the most chocolate.\n\n6. May protect your skin from the sun The bioactive compounds in dark chocolate may also be great for your skin. The flavanols can protect against sun damage, improve blood flow to the skin, and increase skin density and hydration ( 22 ). The minimal erythemal dose (MED) is the minimum amount of UVB rays required to cause redness in the skin 24 hours after exposure. In one study of 30 people, the MED more than doubled after consuming dark chocolate high in flavanols for 12 weeks ( 23 ). If you\xe2\x80\x99re planning a beach vacation, consider enjoying some extra dark chocolate in the prior weeks and months. But check with your doctor or dermatologist before forgoing your normal skin care routine in favor of more dark chocolate. Summary Studies show that the flavanols from cocoa can improve blood flow to the skin and protect it from sun damage.\n\n7. Could improve brain function The good news isn\xe2\x80\x99t over yet. Dark chocolate may also improve the function of your brain. One study of healthy volunteers showed that eating high flavanol cocoa for 5 days improved blood flow to the brain ( 24 ). Cocoa may also significantly improve cognitive function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment. It may improve verbal fluency and several risk factors for disease, as well ( 25 ). Additionally, cocoa contains stimulant substances like caffeine and theobromine, which may be a key reason why it can improve brain function in the short term ( 26 ). Summary Cocoa or dark chocolate may improve brain function by increasing blood flow. It also contains stimulants like caffeine and theobromine.'";"Other";"9.txt-Other"
"901.txt";"b'Food produced from the seed of Theobroma cacao\n\nChocolate is a food product made from roasted and ground cacao pods, that is available as a liquid, solid or paste, on its own or as a flavoring agent in other foods. Cacao has been consumed in some form since at least the Olmec civilization (19th-11th century BCE),[1][2] and the majority of Mesoamerican people - including the Maya and Aztecs - made chocolate beverages.[3]\n\nThe seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor. After fermentation, the beans are dried, cleaned, and roasted. The shell is removed to produce cocoa nibs, which are then ground to cocoa mass, unadulterated chocolate in rough form. Once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating, it is called chocolate liquor. The liquor may also be cooled and processed into its two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter. Baking chocolate, also called bitter chocolate, contains cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions, without any added sugar. Powdered baking cocoa, which contains more fiber than cocoa butter, can be processed with alkali to produce dutch cocoa. Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, a combination of cocoa solids, cocoa butter or added vegetable oils, and sugar. Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder or condensed milk. White chocolate contains cocoa butter, sugar, and milk, but no cocoa solids.\n\nChocolate is one of the most popular food types and flavors in the world, and many foodstuffs involving chocolate exist, particularly desserts, including cakes, pudding, mousse, chocolate brownies, and chocolate chip cookies. Many candies are filled with or coated with sweetened chocolate. Chocolate bars, either made of solid chocolate or other ingredients coated in chocolate, are eaten as snacks. Gifts of chocolate molded into different shapes (such as eggs, hearts, coins) are traditional on certain Western holidays, including Christmas, Easter, Valentine\'s Day, and Hanukkah. Chocolate is also used in cold and hot beverages, such as chocolate milk and hot chocolate, and in some alcoholic drinks, such as creme de cacao.\n\nAlthough cocoa originated in the Americas, West African countries, particularly C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire and Ghana, are the leading producers of cocoa in the 21st century, accounting for some 60% of the world cocoa supply.\n\nWith some two million children involved in the farming of cocoa in West Africa, child slavery and trafficking were major concerns in 2018,[4][5] and continue to be. International attempts to improve conditions for children were doomed to failure because of persistent poverty, absence of schools, increasing world cocoa demand, more intensive farming of cocoa, and continued exploitation of child labor.[4]\n\nHistory\n\nMesoamerican usage\n\nTwo Mayans sit around a container of frothed chocolate.\n\nChocolate has been prepared as a drink for nearly all of its history. For example, one vessel found at an Olmec archaeological site on the Gulf Coast of Veracruz, Mexico, dates chocolate\'s preparation by pre-Olmec peoples as early as 1750 BC.[6] On the Pacific coast of Chiapas, Mexico, a Mokaya archaeological site provides evidence of cocoa beverages dating even earlier, to 1900 BC.[7][6] The residues and the kind of vessel in which they were found indicate the initial use of cocoa was not simply as a beverage, but the white pulp around the cocoa beans was likely used as a source of fermentable sugars for an alcoholic drink.[8]\n\nMan Carrying a Cacao Pod, 1440\xe2\x80\x931521. Volcanic stone, traces of red pigment. Aztec., 1440\xe2\x80\x931521. Volcanic stone, traces of red pigment. Brooklyn Museum\n\nAn early Classic-period (460\xe2\x80\x93480 AD) Mayan tomb from the site in Rio Azul had vessels with the Maya glyph for cocoa on them with residue of a chocolate drink, suggests the Maya were drinking chocolate around 400 AD.[9] Documents in Maya hieroglyphs stated chocolate was used for ceremonial purposes, in addition to everyday life.[10] The Maya grew cacao trees in their backyards,[11] and used the cocoa seeds the trees produced to make a frothy, bitter drink.[12]\n\nBy the 15th century, the Aztecs gained control of a large part of Mesoamerica and adopted cocoa into their culture. They associated chocolate with Quetzalcoatl, who, according to one legend, was cast away by the other gods for sharing chocolate with humans,[13] and identified its extrication from the pod with the removal of the human heart in sacrifice.[14] In contrast to the Maya, who liked their chocolate warm, the Aztecs drank it cold, seasoning it with a broad variety of additives, including the petals of the Cymbopetalum penduliflorum tree, chile pepper, allspice, vanilla, and honey.\n\nThe Aztecs were unable to grow cocoa themselves, as their home in the Mexican highlands was unsuitable for it, so chocolate was a luxury imported into the empire.[13] Those who lived in areas ruled by the Aztecs were required to offer cocoa seeds in payment of the tax they deemed ""tribute"".[13] Cocoa beans were often used as currency.[15] For example, the Aztecs used a system in which one turkey cost 100 cocoa beans and one fresh avocado was worth three beans.[16]\n\nThe Maya and Aztecs associated cocoa with human sacrifice, and chocolate drinks specifically with sacrificial human blood. The Spanish royal chronicler Gonzalo Fern\xc3\xa1ndez de Oviedo y Vald\xc3\xa9s described a chocolate drink he had seen in Nicaragua in 1528, mixed with achiote: ""because those people are fond of drinking human blood, to make this beverage seem like blood, they add a little achiote, so that it then turns red. ... and part of that foam is left on the lips and around the mouth, and when it is red for having achiote, it seems a horrific thing, because it seems like blood itself.""\n\nEuropean adaptation\n\nThe morning chocolate by Chocolate soon became a fashionable drink of the European nobility after the discovery of the Americas.by Pietro Longhi ; Venice, 1775\xe2\x80\x931780\n\nUntil the 16th century, no European had ever heard of the popular drink from the Central American peoples.[13] Christopher Columbus and his son Ferdinand encountered the cocoa bean on Columbus\'s fourth mission to the Americas on 15 August 1502, when he and his crew seized a large native canoe that proved to contain cocoa beans among other goods for trade.[19] Spanish conquistador Hern\xc3\xa1n Cort\xc3\xa9s may have been the first European to encounter it, as the frothy drink was part of the after-dinner routine of Montezuma.[9][20] Jos\xc3\xa9 de Acosta, a Spanish Jesuit missionary who lived in Peru and then Mexico in the later 16th century, wrote of its growing influence on the Spaniards:\n\nAlthough bananas are more profitable, cocoa is more highly esteemed in Mexico. . . Cocoa is a smaller fruit than almonds and thicker, which toasted do not taste bad. It is so prized among the Indians and even among Spaniards. . . because since it is a dried fruit it can be stored for a long time without deterioration, and they brings ships loaded with them from the province of Guatemala. . . It also serves as currency, because with five cocoas you can buy one thing, with thirty another, and with a hundred something else, without there being contradiction; and they give these cocoas as alms to the poor who beg for them. The principal product of this cocoa is a concoction which they make that they call \xe2\x80\x9cchocolate,\xe2\x80\x9d which is a crazy thing treasured in that land, and those who are not accustomed are disgusted by it, because it has a foam on top and a bubbling like that of feces, which certainly takes a lot to put up with. Anyway, it is the prized beverage which the Indians offer to nobles who come to or pass through their lands; and the Spaniards, especially Spanish women born in those lands die for black chocolate. This aforementioned chocolate is said to the be made in various forms and temperaments, hot, cold, and lukewarm. They are wont to use spices and much chili; they also make it into a paste, and it is said that it is a medicine to treat coughs, the stomach, and colds. Whatever may be the case, in fact those who have not been reared on this opinion are not appetized by it.[21]\n\n""Trait\xc3\xa9s nouveaux & curieux du caf\xc3\xa9 du th\xc3\xa9 et du chocolate"", by Philippe Sylvestre Dufour, 1685 , by Philippe Sylvestre Dufour, 1685\n\nWhile Columbus had taken cocoa beans with him back to Spain,[19] chocolate made no impact until Spanish friars introduced it to the Spanish court.[13] After the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs, chocolate was imported to Europe. There, it quickly became a court favorite. It was still served as a beverage, but the Spanish added sugar, as well as honey (the original sweetener used by the Aztecs for chocolate), to counteract the natural bitterness.[22] Vanilla, another indigenous American introduction, was also a popular additive, with pepper and other spices sometimes used to give the illusion of a more potent vanilla flavor. Unfortunately, these spices tended to unsettle the European constitution; the Encyclop\xc3\xa9die states, ""The pleasant scent and sublime taste it imparts to chocolate have made it highly recommended; but a long experience having shown that it could potentially upset one\'s stomach"", which is why chocolate without vanilla was sometimes referred to as ""healthy chocolate"".[23] By 1602, chocolate had made its way from Spain to Austria.[24] By 1662, Pope Alexander VII had declared that religious fasts were not broken by consuming chocolate drinks. Within about a hundred years, chocolate established a foothold throughout Europe.[13]\n\nmoulinet or swizzle stick, London 1714\xe2\x80\x9315 ( Silver chocolate pot with hinged finial to insert aor swizzle stick, London 1714\xe2\x80\x9315 ( Victoria and Albert Museum\n\nThe new craze for chocolate brought with it a thriving slave market, as between the early 1600s and late 1800s, the laborious and slow processing of the cocoa bean was manual.[13] Cocoa plantations spread, as the English, Dutch, and French colonized and planted. With the depletion of Mesoamerican workers, largely to disease, cocoa production was often the work of poor wage laborers and African slaves. Wind-powered and horse-drawn mills were used to speed production, augmenting human labor. Heating the working areas of the table-mill, an innovation that emerged in France in 1732, also assisted in extraction.[25]\n\nNew processes that sped the production of chocolate emerged early in the Industrial Revolution. In 1815, Dutch chemist Coenraad van Houten introduced alkaline salts to chocolate, which reduced its bitterness.[13] A few years thereafter, in 1828, he created a press to remove about half the natural fat (cocoa butter or cocoa butter) from chocolate liquor, which made chocolate both cheaper to produce and more consistent in quality. This innovation introduced the modern era of chocolate.[19]\n\nKnown as ""Dutch cocoa"", this machine-pressed chocolate was instrumental in the transformation of chocolate to its solid form when, in 1847, English chocolatier Joseph Fry discovered a way to make chocolate moldable when he mixed the ingredients of cocoa powder and sugar with melted cocoa butter.[22] Subsequently, his chocolate factory, Fry\'s of Bristol, England, began mass-producing chocolate bars, Fry\'s Chocolate Cream, launched in 1866, and they became very popular.[26] Milk had sometimes been used as an addition to chocolate beverages since the mid-17th century, but in 1875 Swiss chocolatier Daniel Peter invented milk chocolate by mixing a powdered milk developed by Henri Nestl\xc3\xa9 with the liquor.[13][19] In 1879, the texture and taste of chocolate was further improved when Rudolphe Lindt invented the conching machine.[27]\n\nBesides Nestl\xc3\xa9, several notable chocolate companies had their start in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Rowntree\'s of York set up and began producing chocolate in 1862, after buying out the Tuke family business. Cadbury was manufacturing boxed chocolates in England by 1868.[13] Manufacturing their first Easter egg in 1875, Cadbury created the modern chocolate Easter egg after developing a pure cocoa butter that could easily be molded into smooth shapes.[28] In 1893, Milton S. Hershey purchased chocolate processing equipment at the World\'s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, and soon began the career of Hershey\'s chocolates with chocolate-coated caramels.\n\nIntroduction to the United States\n\nThe Baker Chocolate Company, which makes Baker\'s Chocolate, is the oldest producer of chocolate in the United States. In 1765 Dr. James Baker and John Hannon founded the company in Boston. Using cocoa beans from the West Indies, the pair built their chocolate business, which is still in operation.[29][30]\n\nWhite chocolate was first introduced to the U.S. in 1946 by Frederick E. Hebert of Hebert Candies in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, near Boston, after he had tasted ""white coat"" candies while traveling in Europe.[31][30]\n\nEtymology\n\nCocoa, pronounced by the Olmecs as kakawa,[1] dates to 1000 BC or earlier.[1] The word ""chocolate"" entered the English language from Spanish in about 1600.[32] The word entered Spanish from the word chocol\xc4\x81tl in Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs. The origin of the Nahuatl word is uncertain, as it does not appear in any early Nahuatl source, where the word for chocolate drink is cacahuatl, ""cocoa water"". It is possible that the Spaniards coined the word (perhaps in order to avoid caca, a vulgar Spanish word for ""faeces"") by combining the Yucatec Mayan word chocol, ""hot"", with the Nahuatl word atl, ""water"". A widely-cited proposal is that the derives from unattested xocolatl meaning ""bitter drink"" is unsupported; the change from x- to ch- is unexplained, as is the -l-. Another proposed etymology derives it from the word chicolatl, meaning ""beaten drink"", which may derive from the word for the frothing stick, chicoli.[34] Other scholars reject all these proposals, considering the origin of first element of the name to be unknown.[35] The term ""chocolatier"", for a chocolate confection maker, is attested from 1888.[36]\n\nTypes\n\nChocolate is commonly used as a coating for various fruits such as cherries and/or fillings, such as liqueurs\n\nSeveral types of chocolate can be distinguished. Pure, unsweetened chocolate, often called ""baking chocolate"", contains primarily cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions. Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, which combines chocolate with sugar.\n\nMilk\n\nMilk chocolate is sweet chocolate that also contains milk powder or condensed milk. In the UK and Ireland, milk chocolate must contain a minimum of 20% total dry cocoa solids; in the rest of the European Union, the minimum is 25%.[37]\n\nWhite\n\nWhite chocolate\n\nWhite chocolate, although similar in texture to that of milk and dark chocolate, does not contain any cocoa solids that impart a dark color. In 2002, the US Food and Drug Administration established a standard for white chocolate as the ""common or usual name of products made from cocoa fat (i.e., cocoa butter), milk solids, nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners, and other safe and suitable ingredients, but containing no nonfat cocoa solids"".[38]\n\nDark\n\nDark chocolate is produced by adding fat and sugar to the cocoa mixture. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration calls this ""sweet chocolate"", and requires a 15% concentration of chocolate liquor. European rules specify a minimum of 35% cocoa solids.[37] A higher amount of cocoa solids indicates more bitterness. Semisweet chocolate is dark chocolate with low sugar content. Bittersweet chocolate is chocolate liquor to which some sugar (typically a third), more cocoa butter and vanilla are added.[39] It has less sugar and more liquor than semisweet chocolate, but the two are interchangeable in baking. It is also known to last for two years if stored properly. As of 2017 , there is no high-quality evidence that dark chocolate affects blood pressure significantly or provides other health benefits.[40]\n\nUnsweetened\n\nUnsweetened chocolate is pure chocolate liquor, also known as bitter or baking chocolate. It is unadulterated chocolate: the pure, ground, roasted chocolate beans impart a strong, deep chocolate flavor. It is typically used in baking or other products to which sugar and other ingredients are added. Raw chocolate, often referred to as raw cocoa, is always dark and a minimum of 75% cocoa.\n\nUnsweetened ""Baking"" Chocolate\n\nPoorly tempered or untempered chocolate may have whitish spots on the dark chocolate part, called chocolate bloom; it is an indication that sugar or fat has separated due to poor storage. It is not toxic and can be safely consumed.[41]\n\nProduction\n\nChocolate is created from the cocoa bean. A cacao tree with fruit pods in various stages of ripening.\n\nRoughly two-thirds of the entire world\'s cocoa is produced in West Africa, with 43% sourced from C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire,[42] where, as of 2007 , child labor is a common practice to obtain the product.[43][44] According to the World Cocoa Foundation, in 2007 some 50 million people around the world depended on cocoa as a source of livelihood.[45] As of 2007 in the UK, most chocolatiers purchase their chocolate from them, to melt, mold and package to their own design.[46] According to the WCF\'s 2012 report, the Ivory Coast is the largest producer of cocoa in the world.[47] The two main jobs associated with creating chocolate candy are chocolate makers and chocolatiers. Chocolate makers use harvested cocoa beans and other ingredients to produce couverture chocolate (covering). Chocolatiers use the finished couverture to make chocolate candies (bars, truffles, etc.).[48]\n\nProduction costs can be decreased by reducing cocoa solids content or by substituting cocoa butter with another fat. Cocoa growers object to allowing the resulting food to be called ""chocolate"", due to the risk of lower demand for their crops.[45]\n\nGenome\n\nThe sequencing in 2010 of the genome of the cacao tree may allow yields to be improved.[49] Due to concerns about global warming effects on lowland climate in the narrow band of latitudes where cocoa is grown (20 degrees north and south of the equator), the commercial company Mars, Incorporated and the University of California, Berkeley are conducting genomic research in 2017\xe2\x80\x9318 to improve the survivability of cacao plants in hot climates.[50]\n\nCacao varieties\n\nChocolate is made from cocoa beans, the dried and fermented seeds of the cacao tree (Theobroma cacao), a small, 4\xe2\x80\x938 m tall (15\xe2\x80\x9326 ft tall) evergreen tree native to the deep tropical region of the Americas. Recent genetic studies suggest the most common genotype of the plant originated in the Amazon basin and was gradually transported by humans throughout South and Central America. Early forms of another genotype have also been found in what is now Venezuela. The scientific name, Theobroma, means ""food of the gods"".[51] The fruit, called a cocoa pod, is ovoid, 15\xe2\x80\x9330 cm (6\xe2\x80\x9312 in) long and 8\xe2\x80\x9310 cm (3\xe2\x80\x934 in) wide, ripening yellow to orange, and weighing about 500 g (1.1 lb) when ripe.\n\nCacao trees are small, understory trees that need rich, well-drained soils. They naturally grow within 20\xc2\xb0 of either side of the equator because they need about 2000 mm of rainfall a year, and temperatures in the range of 21 to 32 \xc2\xb0C (70 to 90 \xc2\xb0F). Cacao trees cannot tolerate a temperature lower than 15 \xc2\xb0C (59 \xc2\xb0F).[52]\n\nThe three main varieties of cocoa beans used in chocolate are criollo, forastero, and trinitario.\n\nCriollo\n\nRepresenting only 5% of all cocoa beans grown as of 2008 ,[53] criollo is the rarest and most expensive cocoa on the market, and is native to Central America, the Caribbean islands and the northern tier of South American states.[54] The genetic purity of cocoas sold today as criollo is disputed, as most populations have been exposed to the genetic influence of other varieties.\n\nCriollos are particularly difficult to grow, as they are vulnerable to a variety of environmental threats and produce low yields of cocoa per tree. The flavor of criollo is described as delicate yet complex, low in classic chocolate flavor, but rich in ""secondary"" notes of long duration.[55]\n\nForastero\n\nThe most commonly grown bean is forastero,[53] a large group of wild and cultivated cocoas, most likely native to the Amazon basin. The African cocoa crop is entirely made up of forastero. They are significantly hardier and of higher yield than criollo. The source of most chocolate marketed,[53] forastero cocoas are typically strong in classic ""chocolate"" flavor, but have a short duration and are unsupported by secondary flavors, producing ""quite bland"" chocolate.[53]\n\nTrinitario\n\nTrinitario is a natural hybrid of criollo and forastero. Trinitario originated in Trinidad after an introduction of forastero to the local criollo crop. Nearly all cocoa produced over the past five decades is of the forastero or lower-grade trinitario varieties.[56]\n\nProcessing\n\nCocoa pods are harvested by cutting them from the tree using a machete, or by knocking them off the tree using a stick. The beans with their surrounding pulp are removed from the pods and placed in piles or bins, allowing access to micro-organisms so fermentation of the pectin-containing material can begin. Yeasts produce ethanol, lactic acid bacteria produce lactic acid, and acetic acid bacteria produce acetic acid. The fermentation process, which takes up to seven days, also produces several flavor precursors, eventually resulting in the familiar chocolate taste.[57]\n\nIt is important to harvest the pods when they are fully ripe, because if the pod is unripe, the beans will have a low cocoa butter content, or sugars in the white pulp will be insufficient for fermentation, resulting in a weak flavor. After fermentation, the beans must be quickly dried to prevent mold growth. Climate and weather permitting, this is done by spreading the beans out in the sun from five to seven days.[58]\n\nThe dried beans are then transported to a chocolate manufacturing facility. The beans are cleaned (removing twigs, stones, and other debris), roasted, and graded. Next, the shell of each bean is removed to extract the nib. Finally, the nibs are ground and liquefied, resulting in pure chocolate in fluid form: chocolate liquor.[59] The liquor can be further processed into two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter.[60]\n\nBlending\n\nChocolate liquor is blended with the cocoa butter in varying quantities to make different types of chocolate or couverture. The basic blends of ingredients for the various types of chocolate (in order of highest quantity of cocoa liquor first), are:\n\nFountain chocolate is made with high levels of cocoa butter, allowing it to flow gently over a chocolate fountain to serve as dessert fondue\n\nDark chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa liquor, and (sometimes) vanilla\n\nMilk chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa liquor, milk or milk powder, and vanilla\n\nWhite chocolate: sugar, cocoa butter, milk or milk powder, and vanilla\n\nUsually, an emulsifying agent, such as soy lecithin, is added, though a few manufacturers prefer to exclude this ingredient for purity reasons and to remain GMO-free, sometimes at the cost of a perfectly smooth texture. Some manufacturers are now using PGPR, an artificial emulsifier derived from castor oil that allows them to reduce the amount of cocoa butter while maintaining the same mouthfeel.\n\nThe texture is also heavily influenced by processing, specifically conching (see below). The more expensive chocolate tends to be processed longer and thus has a smoother texture and mouthfeel, regardless of whether emulsifying agents are added.\n\nDifferent manufacturers develop their own ""signature"" blends based on the above formulas, but varying proportions of the different constituents are used. The finest, plain dark chocolate couverture contains at least 70% cocoa (both solids and butter), whereas milk chocolate usually contains up to 50%. High-quality white chocolate couverture contains only about 35% cocoa butter.\n\nProducers of high-quality, small-batch chocolate argue that mass production produces bad-quality chocolate.[53] Some mass-produced chocolate contains much less cocoa (as low as 7% in many cases), and fats other than cocoa butter. Vegetable oils and artificial vanilla flavor are often used in cheaper chocolate to mask poorly fermented and/or roasted beans.[53]\n\nIn 2007, the Chocolate Manufacturers Association in the United States, whose members include Hershey, Nestl\xc3\xa9, and Archer Daniels Midland, lobbied the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to change the legal definition of chocolate to let them substitute partially hydrogenated vegetable oils for cocoa butter, in addition to using artificial sweeteners and milk substitutes.[61] Currently, the FDA does not allow a product to be referred to as ""chocolate"" if the product contains any of these ingredients.[62][63]\n\nIn the EU a product can be sold as chocolate if it contains up to 5% vegetable oil, and must be labeled as ""family milk chocolate"" rather than ""milk chocolate"" if it contains 20% milk.[64]\n\nAccording to Canadian Food and Drug Regulations,[65] a ""chocolate product"" is a food product that is sourced from at least one ""cocoa product"" and contains at least one of the following: ""chocolate, bittersweet chocolate, semi-sweet chocolate, dark chocolate, sweet chocolate, milk chocolate, or white chocolate"". A ""cocoa product"" is defined as a food product that is sourced from cocoa beans and contains ""cocoa nibs, cocoa liquor, cocoa mass, unsweetened chocolate, bitter chocolate, chocolate liquor, cocoa, low-fat cocoa, cocoa powder, or low-fat cocoa powder"".\n\nConching\n\nChocolate melanger mixing raw ingredients\n\nThe penultimate process is called conching. A conche is a container filled with metal beads, which act as grinders. The refined and blended chocolate mass is kept in a liquid state by frictional heat. Chocolate before conching has an uneven and gritty texture. The conching process produces cocoa and sugar particles smaller than the tongue can detect (typically around 20 \xce\xbcm) and reduces rough edges, hence the smooth feel in the mouth. The length of the conching process determines the final smoothness and quality of the chocolate. High-quality chocolate is conched for about 72 hours, and lesser grades about four to six hours. After the process is complete, the chocolate mass is stored in tanks heated to about 45 to 50 \xc2\xb0C (113 to 122 \xc2\xb0F) until final processing.[66]\n\nTempering\n\nVideo of cocoa beans being ground and mixed with other ingredients to make chocolate at a Mayordomo store in Oaxaca\n\nThe final process is called tempering. Uncontrolled crystallization of cocoa butter typically results in crystals of varying size, some or all large enough to be seen with the naked eye. This causes the surface of the chocolate to appear mottled and matte, and causes the chocolate to crumble rather than snap when broken.[67][68] The uniform sheen and crisp bite of properly processed chocolate are the results of consistently small cocoa butter crystals produced by the tempering process.\n\nThe fats in cocoa butter can crystallize in six different forms (polymorphous crystallization).[67][69] The primary purpose of tempering is to assure that only the best form is present. The six different crystal forms have different properties.\n\nCrystal Melting temp. Notes I 17 \xc2\xb0C (63 \xc2\xb0F) Soft, crumbly, melts too easily II 21 \xc2\xb0C (70 \xc2\xb0F) Soft, crumbly, melts too easily III 26 \xc2\xb0C (79 \xc2\xb0F) Firm, poor snap, melts too easily IV 28 \xc2\xb0C (82 \xc2\xb0F) Firm, good snap, melts too easily V 34 \xc2\xb0C (93 \xc2\xb0F) Glossy, firm, best snap, melts near body temperature (37 \xc2\xb0C) VI 36 \xc2\xb0C (97 \xc2\xb0F) Hard, takes weeks to form\n\nMolten chocolate and a piece of a chocolate bar\n\nAs a solid piece of chocolate, the cocoa butter fat particles are in a crystalline rigid structure that gives the chocolate its solid appearance. Once heated, the crystals of the polymorphic cocoa butter can break apart from the rigid structure and allow the chocolate to obtain a more fluid consistency as the temperature increases \xe2\x80\x93 the melting process. When the heat is removed, the cocoa butter crystals become rigid again and come closer together, allowing the chocolate to solidify.[70]\n\nThe temperature in which the crystals obtain enough energy to break apart from their rigid conformation would depend on the milk fat content in the chocolate and the shape of the fat molecules, as well as the form of the cocoa butterfat. Chocolate with a higher fat content will melt at a lower temperature.[71]\n\nMaking chocolate considered ""good"" is about forming as many type V crystals as possible. This provides the best appearance and texture and creates the most stable crystals, so the texture and appearance will not degrade over time. To accomplish this, the temperature is carefully manipulated during the crystallization.\n\npistoles and callets Chocolate cubes,and\n\nGenerally, the chocolate is first heated to 45 \xc2\xb0C (113 \xc2\xb0F) to melt all six forms of crystals.[67][69] Next, the chocolate is cooled to about 27 \xc2\xb0C (81 \xc2\xb0F), which will allow crystal types IV and V to form. At this temperature, the chocolate is agitated to create many small crystal ""seeds"" which will serve as nuclei to create small crystals in the chocolate. The chocolate is then heated to about 31 \xc2\xb0C (88 \xc2\xb0F) to eliminate any type IV crystals, leaving just type V. After this point, any excessive heating of the chocolate will destroy the temper and this process will have to be repeated. Other methods of chocolate tempering are used as well. The most common variant is introducing already tempered, solid ""seed"" chocolate. The temper of chocolate can be measured with a chocolate temper meter to ensure accuracy and consistency. A sample cup is filled with the chocolate and placed in the unit which then displays or prints the results.\n\nTwo classic ways of manually tempering chocolate are:\n\nWorking the molten chocolate on a heat-absorbing surface, such as a stone slab, until thickening indicates the presence of sufficient crystal ""seeds""; the chocolate is then gently warmed to working temperature.\n\nStirring solid chocolate into molten chocolate to ""inoculate"" the liquid chocolate with crystals (this method uses the already formed crystals of the solid chocolate to ""seed"" the molten chocolate).\n\nChocolate tempering machines (or temperers) with computer controls can be used for producing consistently tempered chocolate. In particular, continuous tempering machines are used in large volume applications. Various methods and apparatuses for continuous flow tempering have been described by Aasted, Sollich and Buhler, three manufacturers of commercial chocolate equipment, with a focus now on energy efficiency. In general, molten chocolate coming in at 40\xe2\x80\x9350 \xc2\xb0C is cooled in heat exchangers to crystallization temperates of about 26\xe2\x80\x9330 \xc2\xb0C, passed through a tempering column consisting of spinning plates to induce shear, then warmed slightly to re-melt undesirable crystal formations.[72][73]\n\nShaping\n\nChocolate is molded in different shapes for different uses:[74]\n\nChocolate bars (tablets) are rectangular blocks of chocolate meant to be broken down to cubes (or other predefined shapes), which can then be used for consumption, cooking and baking. The term is also used for combination bars, which are a type of candy bars\n\nChocolate chips are small pieces of chocolate, usually drop-like, which are meant for decoration and baking\n\nPistoles , callets and f\xc3\xa8ves are small, coin-like or bean-like pieces of chocolate meant for baking and patisserie applications (also see Pistole (coin) and F\xc3\xa8ve (trinket))\n\n, and are small, coin-like or bean-like pieces of chocolate meant for baking and patisserie applications (also see Pistole (coin) and F\xc3\xa8ve (trinket)) Chocolate blocks are large, cuboid chunks of chocolate meant for professional use and further processing\n\nOther, more specialized shapes for chocolate include sticks, curls and hollow semi-spheres\n\nStorage\n\nChocolate is very sensitive to temperature and humidity. Ideal storage temperatures are between 15 and 17 \xc2\xb0C (59 and 63 \xc2\xb0F), with a relative humidity of less than 50%. If refrigerated or frozen without containment, chocolate can absorb enough moisture to cause a whitish discoloration, the result of fat or sugar crystals rising to the surface. Various types of ""blooming"" effects can occur if chocolate is stored or served improperly.[75]\n\nChocolate bloom is caused by storage temperature fluctuating or exceeding 24 \xc2\xb0C (75 \xc2\xb0F), while sugar bloom is caused by temperature below 15 \xc2\xb0C (59 \xc2\xb0F) or excess humidity. To distinguish between different types of bloom, one can rub the surface of the chocolate lightly, and if the bloom disappears, it is fat bloom. Moving chocolate between temperature extremes, can result in an oily texture. Although visually unappealing, chocolate suffering from bloom is safe for consumption and taste unaffected.[76][77][78] Bloom can be reversed by retempering the chocolate or using it for any use that requires melting the chocolate.[79]\n\nChocolate is generally stored away from other foods, as it can absorb different aromas. Ideally, chocolates are packed or wrapped, and placed in proper storage with the correct humidity and temperature. Additionally, chocolate is frequently stored in a dark place or protected from light by wrapping paper. The glossy shine, snap, aroma, texture, and taste of the chocolate can show the quality and if it was stored well.[80]\n\nComposition\n\nNutrition\n\nA 100-gram serving of milk chocolate supplies 540 calories. It is 59% carbohydrates (52% as sugar and 3% as dietary fiber), 30% fat and 8% protein (table). Approximately 65% of the fat in milk chocolate is saturated, mainly palmitic acid and stearic acid, while the predominant unsaturated fat is oleic acid (table).\n\n100-grams of milk chocolate is an excellent source (over 19% of the Daily Value, DV) of riboflavin, vitamin B12 and the dietary minerals, manganese, phosphorus and zinc. Chocolate is a good source (10\xe2\x80\x9319% DV) of calcium, magnesium and iron.\n\nEffects on health\n\nChocolate may be a factor for heartburn in some people because one of its constituents, theobromine, may affect the esophageal sphincter muscle in a way that permits stomach acids to enter the esophagus.[81] Theobromine poisoning is an overdosage reaction to the bitter alkaloid, which happens more frequently in domestic animals than humans. However, daily intake of 50\xe2\x80\x93100 g cocoa (0.8\xe2\x80\x931.5 g theobromine) by humans has been associated with sweating, trembling and severe headache.[82] Chocolate contains alkaloids such as theobromine and phenethylamine, which have physiological effects in humans, but the presence of theobromine renders it toxic to some animals, including dogs and cats.[83]\n\nAccording to a 2005 study, the average lead concentration of cocoa beans is \xe2\x89\xa4 0.5 ng/g, which is one of the lowest reported values for a natural food.[84] However, during cultivation and production, chocolate may absorb lead from the environment (such as in atmospheric emissions of leaded gasoline, which is still being used in Nigeria).[84] Reports from 2014 indicate that ""chocolate might be a significant source"" of lead ingestion for children if consumption is high (with dark chocolate containing higher amounts),[85][86] and ""one 10 g cube of dark chocolate may contain as much as 20% of the daily lead oral limit.""[85]\n\nChocolate and cocoa contain moderate to high amounts of oxalate,[87][88] which may increase the risk of kidney stones.[89]\n\nA few studies have documented allergic reactions from chocolate in children.[81] Other research has shown that dark chocolate can aggravate acne in men who are prone to it.[90] Research has also shown that consuming dark chocolate does not substantially affect blood pressure.[40] Chocolate and cocoa are under preliminary research to determine if consumption affects the risk of certain cardiovascular diseases[91] or cognitive abilities.[92]\n\nOne tablespoonful (5 grams) of dry unsweetened cocoa powder has 12.1 mg of caffeine[93] and a 25-g single serving of dark chocolate has 22.4 mg of caffeine.[94] Although a single 7 oz. serving of coffee may contain 80\xe2\x80\x93175 mg,[95] studies have shown psychoactive effects in caffeine doses as low as 9 mg,[96] and a dose as low as 12.5 mg was shown to have effects on cognitive performance.[97]\n\nExcessive consumption of large quantities of any energy-rich food, such as chocolate, without a corresponding increase in activity to expend the associated calories, can cause weight gain and possibly lead to obesity.[81] Raw chocolate is high in cocoa butter, a fat which is removed during chocolate refining and then added back in varying proportions during the manufacturing process. Manufacturers may add other fats, sugars, and milk, all of which increase the caloric content of chocolate.[81]\n\nPhytochemicals\n\nIn comparison to most foods, cocoa contains more phenolic antioxidants.[98] Cocoa solids are a source of flavonoids[99] and alkaloids, such as theobromine, phenethylamine, and caffeine.[100]\n\nLabeling\n\nSome manufacturers provide the percentage of chocolate in a finished chocolate confection as a label quoting percentage of ""cocoa"" or ""cacao"". This refers to the combined percentage of both cocoa solids and cocoa butter in the bar, not just the percentage of cocoa solids.[101] The Belgian AMBAO certification mark indicates that no non-cocoa vegetable fats have been used in making the chocolate.[102][103] A long-standing dispute between Britain on the one hand and Belgium and France over British use of vegetable fats in chocolate ended in 2000 with the adoption of new standards which permitted the use of up to five percent vegetable fats in clearly labelled products.[104] This British style of chocolate has sometimes been pejoratively referred to as ""vegelate"".[104]\n\nChocolates that are organic[105] or fair trade certified[106] carry labels accordingly.\n\nIn the United States, some large chocolate manufacturers lobbied the federal government to permit confections containing cheaper hydrogenated vegetable oil in place of cocoa butter to be sold as ""chocolate"". In June 2007, in response to consumer concern about the proposal, the FDA reiterated ""Cacao fat, as one of the signature characteristics of the product, will remain a principal component of standardized chocolate.""[107]\n\nIndustry\n\nChocolate, prevalent throughout the world, is a steadily growing, US$50 billion-a-year worldwide business.[108] Europe accounts for 45% of the world\'s chocolate revenue,[109] and the US spent $20 billion in 2013.[110] Big Chocolate is the grouping of major international chocolate companies in Europe and the U.S. U.S. companies Mars and Hershey\'s alone generated $13 billion a year in chocolate sales and account for two-thirds of U.S. production in 2004.[111] Despite the expanding reach of the chocolate industry internationally, cocoa farmers and labourers in the Ivory Coast are unaware of the uses of the beans; the high cost of chocolate products in the Ivory Coast make it inaccessible to the majority of the population, who do not know what it tastes like.[112]\n\nManufacturers\n\nChocolate with various fillings\n\nChocolate manufacturers produce a range of products from chocolate bars to fudge. Large manufacturers of chocolate products include Cadbury (the world\'s largest confectionery manufacturer), Ferrero, Guylian, The Hershey Company, Lindt & Spr\xc3\xbcngli, Mars, Incorporated, Milka, Neuhaus and Suchard.\n\nGuylian is best known for its chocolate sea shells; Cadbury for its Dairy Milk and Creme Egg. The Hershey Company, the largest chocolate manufacturer in North America, produces the Hershey Bar and Hershey\'s Kisses.[113] Mars Incorporated, a large privately owned U.S. corporation, produces Mars Bar, Milky Way, M&M\'s, Twix, and Snickers. Lindt is known for its truffle balls and gold foil-wrapped Easter bunnies.\n\nFood conglomerates Nestl\xc3\xa9 SA and Kraft Foods both have chocolate brands. Nestl\xc3\xa9 acquired Rowntree\'s in 1988 and now markets chocolates under their brand, including Smarties (a chocolate candy) and Kit Kat (a chocolate bar); Kraft Foods through its 1990 acquisition of Jacobs Suchard, now owns Milka and Suchard. In February 2010, Kraft also acquired British-based Cadbury;[114] Fry\'s, Trebor Basset and the fair trade brand Green & Black\'s also belongs to the group.\n\nChild labor in cocoa harvesting\n\nThe widespread use of children in cocoa production is controversial, not only for the concerns about child labor and exploitation, but also because up to 12,000 of the 200,000 children working in C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire, the world\'s biggest producer of cocoa,[115] may be victims of trafficking or slavery.[116] Most attention on this subject has focused on West Africa, which collectively supplies 69 percent of the world\'s cocoa, and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire in particular, which supplies 35 percent of the world\'s cocoa. Thirty percent of children under age 15 in sub-Saharan Africa are child laborers, mostly in agricultural activities including cocoa farming.[118] Major chocolate producers, such as Nestl\xc3\xa9, buy cocoa at commodities exchanges where Ivorian cocoa is mixed with other cocoa.[119]\n\nIn 2009, Salvation Army International Development (SAID) UK stated that 12,000 children have been trafficked on cocoa farms in the Ivory Coast of Africa, where half of the world\'s chocolate is made.[120] SAID UK states that it is these child slaves who are likely to be working in ""harsh and abusive""[121] conditions for the production of chocolate,[120] and an increasing number of health-food[122] and anti-slavery[123] organisations are highlighting and campaigning against the use of trafficking in the chocolate industry.\n\nAs of 2017, approximately 2.1 million children in Ghana and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire were involved in farming cocoa, carrying heavy loads, clearing forests, and being exposed to pesticides.[5] According to Sona Ebai, the former secretary-general of the Alliance of Cocoa Producing Countries: ""I think child labor cannot be just the responsibility of industry to solve. I think it\'s the proverbial all-hands-on-deck: government, civil society, the private sector. And there, you need leadership.""[116] Reported in 2018, a 3-year pilot program \xe2\x80\x93 conducted by Nestl\xc3\xa9 with 26,000 farmers mostly located in C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire \xe2\x80\x93 observed a 51% decrease in the number of children doing hazardous jobs in cocoa farming.[4] The US Department of Labor formed the Child Labor Cocoa Coordinating Group as a public-private partnership with the governments of Ghana and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire to address child labor practices in the cocoa industry.[124] The International Cocoa Initiative involving major cocoa manufacturers established the Child Labor Monitoring and Remediation System intended to monitor thousands of farms in Ghana and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire for child labor conditions,[4][5] but the program reached less than 20% of the child laborers.[125] Despite these efforts, goals to reduce child labor in West Africa by 70% before 2020 are frustrated by persistent poverty, absence of schools, expansion of cocoa farmland, and increased demand for cocoa.[4][126]\n\nIn April 2018, the Cocoa Barometer report stated: ""Not a single company or government is anywhere near reaching the sector-wide objective of the elimination of child labor, and not even near their commitments of a 70% reduction of child labor by 2020"".[126]\n\nFair trade\n\nIn the 2000s, some chocolate producers began to engage in fair trade initiatives, to address concerns about the marginalization of cocoa laborers in developing countries. Traditionally, Africa and other developing countries received low prices for their exported commodities such as cocoa, which caused poverty to abound. Fairtrade seeks to establish a system of direct trade from developing countries to counteract this unfair system.[127] One solution for fair labor practices is for farmers to become part of an Agricultural cooperative. Cooperatives pay farmers a fair price for their cocoa so farmers have enough money for food, clothes, and school fees.[128] One of the main tenets of fair trade is that farmers receive a fair price, but this does not mean that the larger amount of money paid for fair trade cocoa goes directly to the farmers. The effectiveness of fair trade has been questioned. In a 2014 article, The Economist stated that workers on fair trade farms have a lower standard of living than on similar farms outside the fair trade system.[129]\n\nUsage and consumption\n\ns\'more topped with melted chocolate from a chocolate bar\n\nChocolate cake with chocolate frosting\n\nBars\n\nChocolate is sold in chocolate bars, which come in dark chocolate, milk chocolate and white chocolate varieties. Some bars that are mostly chocolate have other ingredients blended into the chocolate, such as nuts, raisins, or crisped rice. Chocolate is used as an ingredient in a huge variety of bars, which typically contain various confectionary ingredients (e.g., nougat, wafers, caramel, nuts, etc.) which are coated in chocolate.\n\nCoating and filling\n\nChocolate is used as a flavouring product in many desserts, such as chocolate cakes, chocolate brownies, chocolate mousse and chocolate chip cookies. Numerous types of candy and snacks contain chocolate, either as a filling (e.g., M&M\'s) or as a coating (e.g., chocolate-coated raisins or chocolate-coated peanuts).\n\nBeverages\n\nSome non-alcoholic beverages contain chocolate, such as chocolate milk, hot chocolate, chocolate milkshakes and tejate. Some alcoholic liqueurs are flavoured with chocolate, such as chocolate liqueur and creme de cacao. Chocolate is a popular flavour of ice cream and pudding, and chocolate sauce is a commonly added as a topping on ice cream sundaes. The caff\xc3\xa8 mocha is an espresso beverage containing chocolate.\n\nSee also\n\nReferences'";"Other";"901.txt-Other"

Its earliest use dates back to the Olmec civilization in Mesoamerica.\n\nThe next time you eat a piece of chocolate, you may not have to feel so guilty about it. Despite its bad reputation for causing weight gain, a number of health benefits may be associated with this delicious treat.\n\nShare on Pinterest Recent research suggests that chocolate may have some health benefits.\n\nChocolate receives a lot of bad press because of its high fat and sugar content. Its consumption has been associated with acne, obesity, high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, and diabetes.\n\nHowever, according to a review of chocolate\xe2\x80\x99s health effects published in the Netherlands Journal of Medicine, it\xe2\x80\x99s not all bad news.\n\nThe authors point to the discovery that cocoa, the key ingredient in chocolate, contains biologically active phenolic compounds.\n\nThis has changed people\xe2\x80\x99s views on chocolate, and it has stimulated research into how it might impact aging, and conditions such as oxidative stress, blood pressure regulation, and atherosclerosis.\n\nChocolate\xe2\x80\x99s antioxidant potential may have a range of health benefits. The higher the cocoa content, as in dark chocolate, the more benefits there are. Dark chocolate may also contain less fat and sugar, but it is important to check the label.\n\nEating chocolate may have the following benefits:\n\nlowering cholesterol levels\n\npreventing cognitive decline\n\nreducing the risk of cardiovascular problems\n\nIt is important to note that the possible health benefits mentioned below came from single studies. More research is needed to confirm that eating chocolate can really improve people\xe2\x80\x99s health.\n\nIn addition, chocolate bars do not contain only cocoa. The benefits and risks of any other ingredients, such as sugar and fat, need to be considered.\n\n1) Cholesterol\n\nOne study, published in The Journal of Nutrition, suggests that chocolate consumption might help reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, also known as \xe2\x80\x9cbad cholesterol.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe researchers set out to investigate whether chocolate bars containing plant sterols (PS) and cocoa flavanols (CF) have any effect on cholesterol levels.\n\nThe authors concluded: \xe2\x80\x9cRegular consumption of chocolate bars containing PS and CF, as part of a low-fat diet, may support cardiovascular health by lowering cholesterol and improving blood pressure.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n2) Cognitive function\n\nScientists at Harvard Medical School have suggested that drinking two cups of hot chocolate a day could help keep the brain healthy and reduce memory decline in older people.\n\nThe researchers found that hot chocolate helped improve blood flow to parts of the brain where it was needed.\n\nLead author, Farzaneh A. Sorond, said:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs different areas of the brain need more energy to complete their tasks, they also need greater blood flow. This relationship, called neurovascular coupling, may play an important role in diseases such as Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nResults of a lab experiment, published in 2014, indicated that a cocoa extract, called lavado, might reduce or prevent damage to nerve pathways found in patients with Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s disease. This extract could help slow symptoms such as cognitive decline.\n\nAnother study, published in 2016 in the journal Appetite, suggests eating chocolate at least once weekly could improve cognitive function.\n\n3) Heart disease\n\nResearch published in The BMJ, suggests that consuming chocolate could help lower the risk of developing heart disease by one-third .\n\nBased on their observations, the authors concluded that higher levels of chocolate consumption could be linked to a lower risk of cardiometabolic disorders.\n\nThey call for further experimental studies to confirm whether consuming chocolate is beneficial.\n\n4) Stroke\n\nCanadian scientists, in a study involving 44,489 individuals, found that people who ate one serving of chocolate were 22 percent less likely to experience a stroke than those who did not. Also, those who had about two ounces of chocolate a week were 46 percent less likely to die from a stroke.\n\nA further study, published in the journal Heart in 2015, tracked the impact of diet on the long-term health of 25,000 men and women.\n\nThe findings suggested that eating up to 100 grams (g) of chocolate each day may be linked to a lower risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\n5) Fetal growth and development\n\nEating 30 g (about one ounce) of chocolate every day during pregnancy might benefit fetal growth and development, according to a study presented at the 2016 Pregnancy Meeting of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine in Atlanta, GA.\n\n6) Athletic performance\n\nShare on Pinterest Chocolate may help athletes cover more distance while using less oxygen.\n\nFindings published in The Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition suggest that a little dark chocolate might boost oxygen availability during fitness training.\n\nResearchers who studied cyclists doing time trials in the United Kingdom found that \xe2\x80\x9cAfter eating dark chocolate, the riders used less oxygen when cycling at a moderate pace and also covered more distance in a two-minute flat-out time trial.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe scientists believe that the success of dark chocolate in this case is that it contains flavonols known as epicatechins, which enhance the release of nitric oxide in the body.

"904.txt";"b'Chocolate is the most popular sweet treat in the world. People around the world (but mostly in Europe and the United States) consume more than 3 million tons of cocoa beans a year, according to the World Cocoa Foundation. And, not only does eating chocolate make you feel good, it may also be good for your heart and your brain.\n\nWhat is chocolate?\n\nChocolate is prepared from the fruit of the Theobroma cacao, a tropical tree whose name means ""food of the gods"" in Greek, according to ""Chocolate: Food of the Gods,"" an online exhibit by the Cornell University Library.\n\nTheobroma cacao trees are native to the Amazon and Orinoco river basins in South America. The trees are widely distributed from southeastern Mexico to the Amazon River. They thrive in hot, humid areas within about 20 degrees of the equator, according to Cornell. As the popularity of chocolate spread, growers established plantations in other regions, such as West Africa and South and Southeast Asia. Today, Ghana, C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire, Nigeria, Indonesia and Brazil account for 79 percent of the world\'s cacao production.\n\nCacao trees bear fruit that are about the same size and shape of a papaya, according to Patric Chocolate. These bumpy, lumpy berries, or pods, are full of up to 50 sour seeds, or beans, covered in white pulp.\n\nCacao seeds are harvested by hand because machines could injure the trees, according to Cornell. Workers remove the pods, which are orange when they are ripe, and open them with a machete. The seeds are placed in large fermentation trays that are stacked and covered in banana leaves, where they are left for two to seven days. Fermentation produces the chocolate flavor and aroma. It also destroys the seed\'s embryo, preventing unwanted germination, and causes the white pulp to fall away from the seeds.\n\nAfter fermenting, the beans dry out on sunny platforms. Workers turn them several times a day for three to five days to complete drying. The beans can dry faster in rotary driers but sun-dried beans taste the best, according to Cornell.\n\nNext, the beans are taken to the chocolate factory, where they are cleaned and debris is removed. The beans are roasted in large, rotating ovens. The roasting draws out flavor and removes the beans from their hulls. Roasted beans go into a winnowing machine, which cracks the beans and removes hulls. The remaining part of the bean is called the nib. Nibs become chocolate.\n\nThe nibs are ground down under a series of rollers. This process results in a thick paste called chocolate liquor. Chocolate liquor does not contain alcohol (however, chocolate liqueur does). It is the main source of unsweetened baking chocolate, according to Pam Williams, co-founder and past president of the Fine Chocolate Industry Association (FCIA) and founder and lead instructor of Ecole Cocolat Professional School of Chocolate Arts.\n\nAt this stage, the type of chocolate being produced is determined. According to the FCIA, ingredients separate fine chocolate from that of average quality. ""Fine chocolate,"" as designated by the FCIA, contains only cacao liquor, cacao butter (optional), sugar, lecithin, vanilla (optional) and possibly milk fats and solids. Additional flavors or ingredients like nuts can be added later.\n\n(Image credit: Dreamstime)\n\nTypes of chocolate\n\nFine chocolate falls into three categories: dark chocolate, milk chocolate and white chocolate, Williams said.\n\nDark chocolate has chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, lecithin, sugar and vanilla.\n\nMilk chocolate has all of the above plus milk fats and milk solids.\n\nWhite chocolate contains everything milk chocolate does except chocolate liquor.\n\nChocolatiers debate whether white chocolate is really chocolate. Until 2002, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration considered it a confectionary rather than chocolate because it does not contain chocolate liquor. The Hershey Food Corp. and the Chocolate Manufacturers Association petitioned the FDA, which added a standard of identity for white chocolate. Because the FDA refers to it as white chocolate, rather than confectionary, some experts, like Williams, accept white chocolate as chocolate.\n\nWithin the three categories, the FDA also acknowledges several grades, Williams said. They include unsweetened or brute, which can be up to 99 percent chocolate liquor; bittersweet; semisweet; and dark milk chocolate. The type of chocolate depends on what ingredients are present and the percentage of cocoa, in addition to where the beans are from and the way they are prepared.\n\nHealth benefits of chocolate\n\nGood heart food\n\nSeveral recent studies have examined the role that chocolate may have on heart health. Cacao beans are full of phytonutrients, which act as antioxidants and provide additional benefits. Furthermore, cacao beans are rich sources of iron, copper, magnesium, zinc and phosphorus, according to the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Dark chocolate contains two to three times more beneficial flavanols than milk chocolate because milk chocolate\'s cacao concentration is diluted with milk and possibly more sugar.\n\nWhile most studies have found some correlation between chocolate consumption and reduced risk of heart problems, the amount and type of chocolate needed requires further study. A 2017 meta-analysis of the effects of chocolate on coronary heart disease, stroke and diabetes published in the journal Nutrients concluded that the most benefit was associated with moderate chocolate intake. The authors found little benefit in heart disease or stroke reduction among people who consumed chocolate more than three times a week. Protective effects against diabetes emerged at two servings a week, but that benefit disappeared if people had more than six servings a week.\n\nOn the other hand, the findings of a large-scale study of more than 150,000 primarily male U.S. veterans who did not have coronary artery disease at the beginning of the study, suggest that eating an ounce of chocolate at least five times a week may help prevent the risk of coronary artery disease-related events like heart attack and heart failure.\n\nChocolate may also help prevent the development of atrial fibrillation, a type of irregular heartbeat that increases the risk of heart failure, stroke and more. A study, published in the journal Heart in 2017, found that adults who ate chocolate at least once a month had 10 to 20 percent lower rates of developing atrial fibrillation than those who never or rarely ate chocolate.\n\nGood brain food\n\nChocolate may be good for the brain. Some studies have focused on chocolate\'s ability to improve cognitive function. A study published in the Journal of Alzheimer\'s Disease in 2016 found that chocolate consumption might lower the risk of cognitive decline in older people. The study looked at nearly 400 Portuguese citizens over age 65 and saw that those who ate a moderate amount of chocolate \xe2\x80\x94 on average, one chocolate snack a week; the study did not differentiate between milk and dark chocolate \xe2\x80\x94 decreased their risk of cognitive decline by 40 percent over two years. Those who ate more chocolate, or those who had more caffeine, saw fewer cognitive benefits.\n\nGood mood food\n\nChocolate is often associated with positive effects on mood, but the reasons why it makes some people feel good are debatable. Chocolate contains substances that stimulate the brain in the same way cannabis does, such as anandamines, and substances that have similar effects as amphetamine, such as tyramine and phenylethylamine, according to the Dartmouth Undergraduate Journal of Science. However, these substances are in very low concentrations \xe2\x80\x94 too low to induce an antidepressant effect.\n\nChocolate may interact with neurotransmitter systems that contribute to appetite, reward and mood regulation, such as dopamine, serotonin and endorphins, according to the 2013 article in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology. However, the authors noted, the effects may have more to do with chocolate\'s taste and smell than its chemical effects.\n\nA 2010 study published in Archives of Internal Medicine found a link between depression and chocolate consumption. The results showed that people who scored high on a screening test for depression consumed more chocolate than those who weren\'t considered depressed. However, the study pointed out that there is only a link, and cannot explain why. Since the participants were not followed over time, the researchers don\'t know whether eating chocolate ameliorates or amplifies a sad mood. The possibilities are many \xe2\x80\x94 from using chocolate as a sort of natural Prozac to the idea that chocolate might have some role in driving depression.\n\nHealth risks of eating chocolate\n\nLike many foods, chocolate is healthiest when eaten in moderation. The sugars and fats that are added to chocolate make it high in calories, which may lead to weight gain. Furthermore, many of the protective effects that chocolate may offer might be mitigated by overconsumption.\n\nHistory of chocolate\n\nScientists debate how long humans have been using and consuming cacao beans. Chocolate\'s history goes back at least 2,000 years, while historians Sophie and Michael Coe, authors of ""The True History of Chocolate"" (Thames and Hudson, 2013), suggest that it might go back four millennia. The word chocolate can be traced back to the Aztec word ""xocoatl,"" the name for a bitter drink made from cacao beans. This was the way chocolate was consumed until the Spanish conquistadors came to Central America.\n\nIn several pre-Columbian Latin American societies, cacao beans were used as currency, according to Smithsonian magazine. Mayans and Aztecs believed the beans had mystical properties and used them during important rituals. When the Spanish arrived, sweetened chocolate came into existence. Legend has it that the Aztec king Montezuma gave conquistador Hern\xc3\xa1n Cort\xc3\xa9s a bitter chocolate drink, which he said was disgusting. But Cort\xc3\xa9s\' men added cane sugar and honey to it and took it back to Spain, where it quickly became popular.\n\nChocolate was a fashionable drink for rich Europeans throughout the 18th century. The Industrial Revolution allowed chocolate to be mass-produced and brought the treat to the masses. The popularity led to the development of cacao tree plantations.\n\nEnslaved people farmed most of the plantations. Initially, Spanish colonizers forced Mesoamericans to farm the cacao plantations, according to ""The Biography of Chocolate"" (Crabtree Publishing Co., 2005), by Adrianna Morganelli. When the indigenous peoples began to die in large numbers from diseases brought by Europeans, enslaved Africans were brought over to make up the labor shortage. In addition to sugarcane, indigo and other crops, enslaved Africans planted, maintained and harvested cacao trees throughout the Caribbean, Central and South America to feed the new European taste for chocolate.\n\nIn 1815, Dutch physicist Coenraad Van Houten experimented with removing varied amounts of the cocoa butter from chocolate liquor, according to Cornell University. This led to the creation of cocoa powder and soon solid chocolate.\n\nIn 1847, a Bristol, England, chocolate company, Fry\'s, created the first mass-produced chocolate bar when Joseph Fry added additional cocoa butter to Van Houten\'s chocolate, which turned it into a moldable paste, according to Bristol Museums. Milk chocolate was invented soon after with the help of Henri Nestl\xc3\xa9, who went on to found the major food company that bears his name. Major European chocolate brands Lindt and Cadbury also got their start in the 1800s; Rodolphe Lindt invented the conching machine, which gives chocolate a velvety texture.\n\nMass chocolate consumption hit the United States in the late 1800s when Milton S. Hershey began selling chocolate-coated caramels. He then developed his own formula for milk chocolate, purchased chocolate factory equipment and introduced mass-produced chocolate bars and other shapes, like Hershey\'s Kisses, in 1900.\n\nIn 1923, the Mars Co. developed the Milky Way bar by putting nougat inside a chocolate bar. That same year, former Hershey employee H.B. Reese introduced Reese\'s Peanut Butter Cups, which later became part of the Hershey brand.\n\nAs the years progressed, chocolate concoctions from both small and large producers became increasingly innovative. In September 2017, Swiss chocolate company Barry Callebaut introduced ruby chocolate. Ruby chocolate comes from isolating specific compounds in cocoa beans, according to Confectionary News. That, along with a modified processing technique, results in a rosy pink chocolate that has a sweet but sour berry taste and no traditional chocolate flavor, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. Other colored chocolates are made from dyed white chocolate.\n\nThreats to chocolate\n\nChocolate production is threatened by climate change. According to a 2016 report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the primary cacao-producing countries of C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire, Ghana, and Indonesia will experience a 2.1 degree Celsius (3.7 degrees Fahrenheit) increase in temperature by 2050. Rainfall will not rise along with the temperature, causing lowered humidity levels. As a result, viable land for cacao production will significantly shrink. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\'s Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability report, 89.5 percent of the 294 chocolate-producing locations studied would become less suitable by 2050.\n\nFarmers and scientists are working to develop strategies to maintain chocolate production. Some farmers are planting taller trees next to cacao trees to increase shade and decrease moisture loss, according to the NOAA. Cacao plantations may also move to higher elevations with cooler temperatures and greater rainfall.\n\nGenetic scientists are taking a different approach. A January 2018 press release from the Innovative Genomics Institute announced a project to develop disease-resistant cacao. Condensing cacao plantations because of climate change could increase the spread of disease. The project will use CRISPR DNA-editing technology to make a heartier cacao seed.\n\nEthics of chocolate production\n\nAccording to Slave Free Chocolate, 2.3 million children work in chocolate production in Ghana and C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire, where they are vulnerable to trafficking, slavery and other violent labor practices. The International Labor Rights Forum reports that these children are often exposed to chemicals, work long hours and are denied education. According to Epicure and Culture, many children are sold into slavery and never see their families again. Others are kidnapped.\n\nThough the Harkin-Engel Protocol of 2001 was designed to stop child labor in the chocolate industry, according to the CNN Freedom Project, little has changed. The deadlines for action have been repeatedly pushed back.\n\nConsumers who want ethical chocolate should look for certifications designating Fair Trade, Rain Forest Alliance, UTZ, and Fair for Life, according to Slave Free Chocolate\xe2\x80\x99s guide to chocolate companies.\n\nChocolate production can also harm the environment. Farmers often clear forests to make room for cacao plantations. According to the World Wildlife Fund, about 70 percent of C\xc3\xb4te d\'Ivoire\'s illegal deforestation is related to cacao farming. One danger of deforestation is soil erosion, which can make land less fertile for cacao plants, creating a vicious cycle, according to Confectionary News.\n\nAdditional resources'";"Other";"904.txt-Other"

Rich in carbohydrates , it is an excellent source of quick energy, and it also contains minute amounts of the stimulating alkaloids theobromine and caffeine .\n\nHistory of chocolate\n\nThe cacao tree was cultivated more than 3,000 years ago by the Maya, Toltec, and Aztec peoples, who prepared a beverage from its fruit, the cocoa bean (sometimes using it as a ceremonial drink) and also used the bean as a currency. The Maya considered chocolate to be the food of the gods, held the cacao tree to be sacred, and even buried dignitaries with bowls of the substance (along with other items deemed useful in the afterlife). In fact, the identification of the (Olmec-originated) word ka-ka-w (\xe2\x80\x9ccacao\xe2\x80\x9d) inscribed on those containers was key to deciphering the Maya\xe2\x80\x99s phonetic manner of writing.\n\nSpain was the earliest European country to incorporate chocolate into its cuisine, but exactly how that happened is vague. It is known that Christopher Columbus took cocoa beans to Spain after his fourth voyage in 1502, though little was made of it at that time. It has been commonly thought (though there appears to be no evidence) that in 1519 Montezuma II, the Aztec ruler of Mexico, served a bitter cocoa-bean drink to the Spanish conquistador Hern\xc3\xa1n Cort\xc3\xa9s, who subsequently introduced the drink to Spain. A strong possibility is that chocolate first arrived in Spain in 1544 with representatives of the Kekch\xc3\xad Mayan people of Guatemala, who came bearing gifts (including chocolate) to visit the court of Prince Philip. However, it was not until 1585 that the first recorded shipment of cocoa beans arrived in Spain from Veracruz, Mexico. Sweetened and flavoured with cinnamon and vanilla, chocolate was served as a hot beverage and became quite popular in the Spanish court. It was many years before chocolate had its introduction to France, England, and beyond.\n\nengraving of an Aztec with cocoa beans and chocolate beverage \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican with his chocolate pot and goblet,\xe2\x80\x9d an engraving of an Aztec with cocoa beans and chocolate beverage, from a French history of chocolate, tea, and coffee, 1685. From Traitez Nouveaux and curieux du caf\xc3\xa9 du th\xc3\xa9 et du chocolate, by Philippe Sylvestre Dufour, 1685\n\nIn 1657 a Frenchman opened a shop in London at which solid chocolate for making the beverage could be purchased at 10 to 15 shillings per pound. At that price only the wealthy could afford to drink it, and there appeared in London, Amsterdam, and other European capitals fashionable chocolate houses, some of which later developed into famous private clubs. In London many chocolate houses were used as political party meeting places as well as high-stakes gambling spots, notably Cocoa-Tree Chocolate-House (later the Cocoa-Tree Club), which opened in 1698, and White\xe2\x80\x99s, which was opened by Francis White in 1693 as White\xe2\x80\x99s Chocolate-House. About 1700 the English improved chocolate by the addition of milk. The reduction of the cost of the beverage was hampered in Great Britain by the imposition of high import duties on the raw cocoa bean, and it was not until the mid-19th century, when the duty was lowered to a uniform rate of one penny per pound, that chocolate became popular.\n\nMeanwhile, the making of chocolate spread overseas and grew in sophistication. Chocolate manufacture started in the American colonies in 1765 at Dorchester, Massachusetts, using beans brought in by New England sea captains from their voyages to the West Indies. James Baker financed the first mill, which was operated by an Irish immigrant, John Hanan. Waterpower was used for grinding the beans. In the Netherlands in 1828, C.J. van Houten patented a process for pressing much of the fat, or cocoa butter, from ground and roasted cocoa beans and thus obtaining cocoa powder. In 1847 the English firm of Fry and Sons combined cocoa butter with chocolate liquor and sugar to produce sweet (eating) chocolate\xe2\x80\x94the base of most chocolate confectionary\xe2\x80\x94and in 1876 Daniel Peter of Switzerland added dried milk to make milk chocolate. The proliferation of flavoured, solid, and coated chocolate foods rapidly followed.'";"Other";"908.txt-Other"

But you needn\'t be divine to indulge. Mere mortals adore chocolate in all its forms, from the humble chocolate chip cookie to gourmet goodies, wintry hot chocolate, and decadent desserts. And to make chocolate even more drool-worthy, researchers are discovering this ancient treat may have some modern health benefits.\n\nQ: When was chocolate first discovered?\n\nA: Chocolate dates back centuries. The Mayans traded valuable cacao beans, from which chocolate is made, as a commodity. In 1519, the Aztecs discovered that they could make a delicious drink by adding water and sweeteners to roasted, ground-up cacao beans. The chocolate bar came along later in the 18th century, by mixing chocolate with milk.\n\nQ: Are all chocolates good for you?\n\nA: Chocolate lovers, rejoice -- but be savvy about chocolate\'s health perks.

"910.txt";"b'Share on Pinterest Screen Moment/Stocksy United Dark chocolate is loaded with nutrients that can positively affect your health. Made from the seed of the cacao tree, it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the best sources of antioxidants you can find. Studies show that dark chocolate can improve your health and lower the risk of heart disease. This article reviews 7 health benefits of dark chocolate or cocoa that are supported by science.\n\n1. Very nutritious If you buy quality dark chocolate with a high cocoa content, then it\xe2\x80\x99s quite nutritious. It contains a decent amount of soluble fiber and is loaded with minerals. A 100-gram bar of dark chocolate with 70\xe2\x80\x9385% cocoa contains (1): 11 grams of fiber\n\n67% of the DV for iron\n\n58% of the DV for magnesium\n\n89% of the DV for copper\n\n98% of the DV for manganese In addition, it has plenty of potassium, phosphorus, zinc, and selenium. Of course, 100 grams (3.5 ounces) is a fairly large amount and not something you should be consuming daily. These nutrients also come with 600 calories and moderate amounts of sugar. For this reason, dark chocolate is best consumed in moderation. The fatty acid profile of cocoa and dark chocolate is also good. The fats consist mostly of oleic acid (a heart-healthy fat also found in olive oil), stearic acid, and palmitic acid. The stearic acid has a neutral effect on body cholesterol. Palmitic acid can raise cholesterol levels, but it only makes up one-third of the total fat calories. Dark chocolate also contains stimulants like caffeine and theobromine, but it\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely to keep you awake at night, as the amount of caffeine is very small compared with coffee. Summary Quality dark chocolate is rich in fiber, iron, magnesium, copper, manganese, and a few other minerals.\n\n2. Powerful source of antioxidants ORAC stands for oxygen radical absorbance capacity. It\xe2\x80\x99s a measure of the antioxidant activity of foods. Basically, researchers set a bunch of free radicals (bad) against a sample of a food and see how well the antioxidants in the food can disarm the free radicals. The biological relevance of ORAC values is questioned, as it\xe2\x80\x99s measured in a test tube and may not have the same effect in the body. However, it\xe2\x80\x99s worth mentioning that raw, unprocessed cocoa beans are among the highest-scoring foods that have been tested. Dark chocolate is loaded with organic compounds that are biologically active and function as antioxidants. These include polyphenols, flavanols and catechins, among others. One study showed that cocoa and dark chocolate had more antioxidant activity, polyphenols, and flavanols than any other fruits tested, which included blueberries and acai berries (2). Summary Cocoa and dark chocolate have a wide variety of powerful antioxidants. In fact, they have way more than most other foods.\n\n3. May improve blood flow and lower blood pressure The flavanols in dark chocolate can stimulate the endothelium, the lining of arteries, to produce nitric oxide (NO) ( 3 ). One of the functions of NO is to send signals to the arteries to relax, which lowers the resistance to blood flow and therefore reduces blood pressure. Many controlled studies show that cocoa and dark chocolate can improve blood flow and lower blood pressure, though the effects are usually mild ( 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ). However, one study in people with high blood pressure showed no effect, so take this with a grain of salt ( 8 ). Given the great variation between studies on this subject, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that more research is needed ( 9 , 10). Summary The bioactive compounds in cocoa may improve blood flow in the arteries and cause a small but statistically significant decrease in blood pressure.\n\n4. Raises HDL and protects LDL from oxidation Consuming dark chocolate can improve several important risk factors for heart disease. In a controlled study, cocoa powder was found to significantly decrease oxidized LDL (bad) cholesterol in men. It also increased HDL and lowered total LDL for those with high cholesterol ( 11 ). Oxidized LDL means that the LDL cholesterol has reacted with free radicals. This makes the LDL particle itself reactive and capable of damaging other tissues, such as the lining of the arteries in your heart. It makes perfect sense that cocoa lowers oxidized LDL. It contains an abundance of powerful antioxidants that do make it into the bloodstream and protect lipoproteins against oxidative damage ( 12 , 13 , 14 ). The flavanols in dark chocolate can also reduce insulin resistance, which is another common risk factor for diseases like heart disease and diabetes ( 15 , 16 , 17 ). However, dark chocolate also contains sugar, which can have the opposite effect. Summary Dark chocolate improves several important risk factors for disease. It lowers the susceptibility of LDL to oxidative damage while increasing HDL and improving insulin sensitivity.\n\n5. May reduce heart disease risk The compounds in dark chocolate appear to be highly protective against the oxidation of LDL. In the long term, this should cause much less cholesterol to lodge in the arteries, resulting in a lower risk of heart disease. In fact, several long-term observational studies show a fairly drastic improvement. In a study of 470 older men, cocoa was found to reduce the risk of death from heart disease by 50% over 15 years ( 18 ). Another study revealed that eating chocolate two or more times per week lowered the risk of having calcified plaque in the arteries by 32%. Eating chocolate less frequently had no effect ( 19 ). Yet another study showed that eating dark chocolate more than five times per week lowered the risk of heart disease by 57% ( 20 ). A 2017 clinical trial found that subjects who consumed almonds with or without dark chocolate showed improved LDL cholesterol levels (21). Of course, these four studies are observational, so it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear exactly if it was the chocolate that reduced the risk. However, since the biological process is known (lower blood pressure and oxidized LDL), it\xe2\x80\x99s plausible that regularly eating dark chocolate may reduce the risk of heart disease. Summary Observational studies show a drastic reduction in heart disease risk among those who consume the most chocolate.\n\n6. May protect your skin from the sun The bioactive compounds in dark chocolate may also be great for your skin. The flavanols can protect against sun damage, improve blood flow to the skin, and increase skin density and hydration ( 22 ). The minimal erythemal dose (MED) is the minimum amount of UVB rays required to cause redness in the skin 24 hours after exposure. In one study of 30 people, the MED more than doubled after consuming dark chocolate high in flavanols for 12 weeks ( 23 ). If you\xe2\x80\x99re planning a beach vacation, consider enjoying some extra dark chocolate in the prior weeks and months. But check with your doctor or dermatologist before forgoing your normal skin care routine in favor of more dark chocolate. Summary Studies show that the flavanols from cocoa can improve blood flow to the skin and protect it from sun damage.\n\n7. Could improve brain function The good news isn\xe2\x80\x99t over yet. Dark chocolate may also improve the function of your brain. One study of healthy volunteers showed that eating high flavanol cocoa for 5 days improved blood flow to the brain ( 24 ). Cocoa may also significantly improve cognitive function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment. It may improve verbal fluency and several risk factors for disease, as well ( 25 ). Additionally, cocoa contains stimulant substances like caffeine and theobromine, which may be a key reason why it can improve brain function in the short term ( 26 ). Summary Cocoa or dark chocolate may improve brain function by increasing blood flow. It also contains stimulants like caffeine and theobromine.'";"Other";"910.txt-Other"
"917.txt";"b'When most of us hear the word chocolate, we picture a bar, a box of bonbons, or a bunny. The verb that comes to mind is probably ""eat,"" not ""drink,"" and the most apt adjective would seem to be ""sweet."" But for about 90 percent of chocolate\'s long history, it was strictly a beverage, and sugar didn\'t have anything to do with it.\n\n""I often call chocolate the best-known food that nobody knows anything about,"" said Alexandra Leaf, a self-described ""chocolate educator"" who runs a business called Chocolate Tours of New York City.\n\nThe terminology can be a little confusing, but most experts these days use the term ""cacao"" to refer to the plant or its beans before processing, while the term ""chocolate"" refers to anything made from the beans, she explained. ""Cocoa"" generally refers to chocolate in a powdered form, although it can also be a British form of ""cacao.""\n\nEtymologists trace the origin of the word ""chocolate"" to the Aztec word ""xocoatl,"" which referred to a bitter drink brewed from cacao beans. The Latin name for the cacao tree, Theobroma cacao, means ""food of the gods.""\n\nMany modern historians have estimated that chocolate has been around for about 2000 years, but recent research suggests that it may be even older.\n\nIn the book The True History of Chocolate, authors Sophie and Michael Coe make a case that the earliest linguistic evidence of chocolate consumption stretches back three or even four millennia, to pre-Columbian cultures of Mesoamerica such as the Olmec.\n\nLast November, anthropologists from the University of Pennsylvania announced the discovery of cacao residue on pottery excavated in Honduras that could date back as far as 1400 B.C.E. It appears that the sweet pulp of the cacao fruit, which surrounds the beans, was fermented into an alcoholic beverage of the time.\n\n""Who would have thought, looking at this, that you can eat it?"" said Richard Hetzler, executive chef of the caf\xc3\xa9 at the Smithsonian\'s National Museum of the American Indian, as he displayed a fresh cacao pod during a recent chocolate-making demonstration. ""You would have to be pretty hungry, and pretty creative!""\n\nIt\'s hard to pin down exactly when chocolate was born, but it\'s clear that it was cherished from the start. For several centuries in pre-modern Latin America, cacao beans were considered valuable enough to use as currency. One bean could be traded for a tamale, while 100 beans could purchase a good turkey hen, according to a 16th-century Aztec document.\n\nBoth the Mayans and Aztecs believed the cacao bean had magical, or even divine, properties, suitable for use in the most sacred rituals of birth, marriage and death. According to Chloe Doutre-Roussel\'s book The Chocolate Connoisseur, Aztec sacrifice victims who felt too melancholy to join in ritual dancing before their death were often given a gourd of chocolate (tinged with the blood of previous victims) to cheer them up. Sweetened chocolate didn\'t appear until Europeans discovered the Americas and sampled the native cuisine. Legend has it that the Aztec king Montezuma welcomed the Spanish explorer Hernando Cortes with a banquet that included drinking chocolate, having tragically mistaken him for a reincarnated deity instead of a conquering invader. Chocolate didn\'t suit the foreigners\' tastebuds at first \xe2\x80\x93one described it in his writings as ""a bitter drink for pigs"" \xe2\x80\x93 but once mixed with honey or cane sugar, it quickly became popular throughout Spain. By the 17th century, chocolate was a fashionable drink throughout Europe, believed to have nutritious, medicinal and even aphrodisiac properties (it\'s rumored that Casanova was especially fond of the stuff). But it remained largely a privilege of the rich until the invention of the steam engine made mass production possible in the late 1700s. In 1828, a Dutch chemist found a way to make powdered chocolate by removing about half the natural fat (cacao butter) from chocolate liquor, pulverizing what remained and treating the mixture with alkaline salts to cut the bitter taste. His product became known as ""Dutch cocoa,"" and it soon led to the creation of solid chocolate. The creation of the first modern chocolate bar is credited to Joseph Fry, who in 1847 discovered that he could make a moldable chocolate paste by adding melted cacao butter back into Dutch cocoa. By 1868, a little company called Cadbury was marketing boxes of chocolate candies in England. Milk chocolate hit the market a few years later, pioneered by another name that may ring a bell \xe2\x80\x93 Nestle. In America, chocolate was so valued during the Revolutionary War that it was included in soldiers\' rations and used in lieu of wages. While most of us probably wouldn\'t settle for a chocolate paycheck these days, statistics show that the humble cacao bean is still a powerful economic force. Chocolate manufacturing is a more than 4-billion-dollar industry in the United States, and the average American eats at least half a pound of the stuff per month. In the 20th century, the word ""chocolate"" expanded to include a range of affordable treats with more sugar and additives than actual cacao in them, often made from the hardiest but least flavorful of the bean varieties (forastero). But more recently, there\'s been a ""chocolate revolution,"" Leaf said, marked by an increasing interest in high-quality, handmade chocolates and sustainable, effective cacao farming and harvesting methods. Major corporations like Hershey\'s have expanded their artisanal chocolate lines by purchasing smaller producers known for premium chocolates, such as Scharffen Berger and Dagoba, while independent chocolatiers continue to flourish as well. ""I see more and more American artisans doing incredible things with chocolate,"" Leaf said. ""Although, I admit that I tend to look at the world through cocoa-tinted glasses.""'";"Other";"917.txt-Other"

"923.txt";"b'Is Chocolate Good for Your Heart?\n\nWhy a little, in moderation, may be beneficial\n\nChocolate has gotten a lot of media coverage in recent years because it\'s believed that it may help protect your cardiovascular system. The reasoning being that the cocoa bean is rich in a class of plant nutrients called flavonoids.\n\nFlavonoids help protect plants from environmental toxins and help repair damage. They can be found in a variety of foods, such as fruits and vegetables. When we eat foods rich in flavonoids, it appears that we also benefit from this ""antioxidant"" power.\n\nAntioxidants are believed to help the body\'s cells resist damage caused by free radicals that are formed by normal bodily processes, such as breathing, and from environmental contaminants, like cigarette smoke. If your body does not have enough antioxidants to combat the amount of oxidation that occurs, it can become damaged by free radicals. For example, an increase in oxidation can cause low-density lipoprotein (LDL), also known as ""bad"" cholesterol, to form plaque on the artery walls.\n\nFlavanols are the main type of flavonoid found in cocoa and chocolate. In addition to having antioxidant qualities, research shows that flavanols have other potential influences on vascular health, such as lowering blood pressure, improving blood flow to the brain and heart, and making blood platelets less sticky and able to clot.\n\nThese plant chemicals aren\xe2\x80\x99t only found in chocolate. In fact, a wide variety of foods and beverages are rich in flavonols. These include cranberries, apples, peanuts, onions, tea and red wine.\n\nAre all types of chocolate healthy?\n\nBefore you grab a chocolate candy bar or slice of chocolate cake, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand that not all forms of chocolate contain high levels of flavanols.\n\nCocoa naturally has a very strong, pungent taste, which comes from the flavanols. When cocoa is processed into your favorite chocolate products, it goes through several steps to reduce this taste. The more chocolate is processed (through things like fermentation, alkalizing, roasting, etc.), the more flavanols are lost.\n\nMost commercial chocolates are highly processed. Although it was once believed that dark chocolate contained the highest levels of flavanols, recent research indicates that, depending on how the dark chocolate was processed, this may not be true. The good news is that most major chocolate manufacturers are looking for ways to keep the flavanols in their processed chocolates. But for now, your best choices are likely dark chocolate over milk chocolate (especially milk chocolate that is loaded with other fats and sugars) and cocoa powder that has not undergone Dutch processing (cocoa that is treated with an alkali to neutralize its natural acidity).\n\nWhat about all of the fat in chocolate?\n\nYou may be surprised to learn that chocolate isn\xe2\x80\x99t as bad for you as once believed.\n\nThe fat in chocolate comes from cocoa butter and is made up of equal amounts of oleic acid (a heart-healthy monounsaturated fat also found in olive oil), stearic and palmitic acids. Stearic and palmitic acids are forms of saturated fat. You may know that saturated fats are linked to increases in LDL cholesterol and the risk of heart disease.\n\nBut, research shows that stearic acid appears to have a neutral effect on cholesterol, neither raising nor lowering it. Although palmitic acid does affect cholesterol levels, it only makes up one-third of the fat calories in chocolate. Still, this does not mean you can eat all the dark chocolate you\xe2\x80\x99d like.\n\nFirst, be careful about the type of dark chocolate you choose: chewy caramel-marshmallow-nut-covered dark chocolate is by no means a heart-healthy food option. Watch out for those extra ingredients that can add lots of extra fat and calories. Second, there is currently no established serving size of chocolate to help you reap the cardiovascular benefits it may offer, and more research is needed in this area. However, we do know that you no longer need to feel guilty if you enjoy a small piece of dark chocolate once in a while.\n\nSo, for now, enjoy moderate portions of chocolate (e.g., 1 ounce) a few times per week, and don\xe2\x80\x99t forget to eat other flavonoid-rich foods like apples, red wine, tea, onions and cranberries.'";"Other";"923.txt-Other"

Small variations in the quality of ingredients, temperature, mixing and timing can all set you up to fail, even when you learn from the best.\n\nThe results of a new study by food scientists from the University of Guelph in Canada suggest the addition of two common, naturally occurring fats \xe2\x80\x93 in the right proportions \xe2\x80\x93 might make chocolate tempering less of a gamble.\n\nPick up just about any block of milk chocolate from your local store, and you'll find it's more or less made out of the same things \xe2\x80\x93 cocoa butter for the form, cocoa mass (or chocolate liquor) for that familiar bitter taste, and additives like sugar or vanilla for sweetness and flavor.\n\nCrafting a solid bar of chocolate is a matter of encouraging the right size and distribution of crystals. In chocolate, crystalline forms of cocoa butter triglycerides (TAGs) are what give the food its characteristic shine, smooth texture, brittleness, and melting point.\n\nNot just any crystalline structure will do, either. Of the six distinct configurations of this class of molecule known to exist, Form V is the one that gives us a perfect temper.\n\nTempering \xe2\x80\x93 transforming the diverse mix of molecules into something that resists your bite while feeling heavenly smooth on your tongue \xe2\x80\x93 is a culinary process that has been gradually perfected over time, relying on a fine-tuned sequence of heating, mixing, and cooling.\n\nWhile researchers have investigated the influence TAG composition has on the success of tempering, little is known about how minor components of cocoa butter might make or break the process, including things like free fatty acids and phospholipids.\n\nGiven they make up just a few percent of the chemicals in cocoa butter, differences in their origins and refining might significantly alter the make-up of this key ingredient, either by helping the right crystals generate or interfering with their growth.\n\nPrevious research hinted at roles certain minor components had in the formation of the 'seed' crystals. For example, having a lot of free fatty acids seems to poison the crystallization process. Phospholipids, on the other hand, appeared to help them grow.\n\nTo nail down the precise proportions and chemical nature of these components, the researchers analyzed the exact make-up of a sample of cocoa butter, varying its composition by adding ingredients or bleaching out existing ones.\n\nThey then subjected it to a variety of tests to determine how variations in fat content might affect the growth time and proportion of crystal types, as well as things like melting point, surface reflection, micro-structure, and flex.\n\nWhile the amount of molecules such as free fatty acids had some effect, the real game-changer was the proportion of phospholipids, specifically saturated phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. Don't let the tongue-twister names fool you, though: these are garden variety biological molecules found in the membranes of living cells.\n\nBoth of these molecules in higher concentrations saw to the formation of Form V crystals, giving the cocoa butter the optimal glass, micro-structure, and mechanical properties.\n\nAdding the right amount of each to chocolate just might take the anxiety out of the tempering process, either by simplifying it or even eliminating it altogether.\n\nThis won't necessarily turn all of us into home kitchen dessertiers.

"930.txt";"b""Originally consumed as a bitter drink, it was prized as both an aphrodisiac and an energy booster.\n\nMankind\xe2\x80\x99s love affair with chocolate stretches back more than five millennia. Produced from the seeds of tropical cacao trees native to the rainforests of Central and South America, chocolate was long considered the \xe2\x80\x9cfood of the gods,\xe2\x80\x9d and later, a delicacy for the elite. But for most of its history, it was actually consumed as a bitter beverage rather than the sweet, edible treat it has become worldwide.\n\nWhat Is the Birthplace of Chocolate?\n\nMayan cacao drink Ren Photo/Getty Images\n\nArchaeologists have discovered the earliest traces of cacao in pottery used by the ancient Mayo-Chinchipe culture 5,300 years ago in the upper Amazon region of Ecuador. Chocolate played an important political, spiritual and economic role in ancient Mesoamerican civilizations, which ground roasted cacao beans into a paste that they mixed with water, vanilla, chili peppers and other spices to brew a frothy chocolate drink.\n\nAncient Mesoamericans believed chocolate was an energy booster and aphrodisiac with mystical and medicinal qualities. The Mayans, who considered cacao a gift from the gods, used chocolate for sacred ceremonies and funeral offerings. Wealthy Mayans drank foaming chocolate drinks, while commoners consumed chocolate in a cold porridge-like dish.\n\nAs people of the Aztec empire spread across Mesoamerica in the 1400s, they too began to prize cacao. Since they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t grow it in the dry highlands of central Mexico, they traded with the Mayans for the beans, which they even used as currency. (In the 1500s, Aztecs could purchase a turkey hen or a hare for 100 beans.) By one account, the 16th-century Aztec ruler Moctezuma II drank 50 cups of chocolate a day out of a golden goblet to increase his libido.\n\nWATCH: Season 1 of The Food That Built America without signing in now.\n\nSpaniards Introduce Chocolate to Europe\xe2\x80\x99s Elite\n\nChocolate arrived in Europe during the 1500s, likely brought by both Spanish friars and conquistadors who had traveled to the Americas. Although the Spanish sweetened the bitter drink with cane sugar and cinnamon, one thing remained unchanged: Chocolate reigned as a delectable symbol of luxury, wealth and power\xe2\x80\x94an expensive import sipped by royal lips, and affordable only to Spanish elites.\n\nChocolate\xe2\x80\x99s popularity eventually spread to other European courts, where aristocrats consumed it as a magic elixir with health benefits. To slake their growing thirst for chocolate, European powers established colonial plantations in equatorial regions around the world to grow cacao and sugar. When diseases brought by Europeans depleted the native Mesoamerican labor pool, African slaves were imported to the Americas to work on the plantations and maintain chocolate production.\n\nChocolate remained an aristocratic nectar until the 1828 invention of the cocoa press revolutionized its production. Attributed in varying accounts to either Dutch chemist Coenraad Johannes van Houten or his father, Casparus, the cocoa press squeezed the fatty butter from roasted cacao beans, leaving behind a dry cake that could be pulverized into a fine powder that could be mixed with liquids and other ingredients, poured into molds and solidified into edible, easily digestible chocolate. The cocoa press ushered in the modern era of chocolate by enabling it to be used as a confectionary ingredient, and the resulting drop in production costs made chocolate much more affordable.\n\nREAD MORE: Why the Candy Bar Market Exploded After WWI\n\nChocolate Becomes a Treat for the Masses\n\n10 Gallery 10 Images\n\nIn 1847, British chocolate company J.S. Fry & Sons created the first edible chocolate bar from cocoa butter, cocoa powder and sugar. Rival chocolatier Cadbury\xe2\x80\x99s, credited with pioneering the Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day chocolate box and chocolate Easter egg, followed suit soon after and in 1854 earned a royal warrant as purveyors of chocolate to Queen Victoria.\n\nIt was in Switzerland that chocolate production took one of its greatest leaps forward. In the 1870s, Swiss chocolatier Daniel Peter utilized a powdered milk developed several years earlier by his neighbor Henri Nestl\xc3\xa9 to produce the first milk chocolate bar, and the pair eventually formed the Nestl\xc3\xa9 Company. Swiss chocolatier Rodolphe Lindt\xe2\x80\x99s 1879 invention of the conching machine\xe2\x80\x94which used large stone rollers to mix and aerate chocolate to give it a velvety texture and superior taste\xe2\x80\x94allowed for the mass production of smooth, creamy milk chocolate.\n\nIn the United States, Milton Hershey pioneered the assembly-line production of milk chocolate. After selling his caramel candy company for $1 million and producing his first milk chocolate bar in 1900, Hershey bought farmland near his birthplace in rural Pennsylvania and built an entire factory town devoted to chocolate. The grass-fed Holsteins on the surrounding dairy farms supplied the company\xe2\x80\x99s milk, and a company town in Cuba supplied its sugar.\n\nREAD MORE: How Hershey's Chocolate Helped Power Allied Troops in WWII\n\nChocolate bars soared in popularity during the Roaring Twenties. By the end of the decade, more than 40,000 different candy bars were being made in the U.S., according to Susan Benjamin, candy historian and author of Sweet as Sin: The Unwrapped Story of How Candy Became America\xe2\x80\x99s Favorite Pleasure. Father-and-son duo Frank C. Mars and Forrest Mars Sr. collaborated on the idea for the Milky Way bar, which hit the market in 1923 with the chocolate for its coating supplied by Hershey\xe2\x80\x99s. The family-owned business would rival Hershey\xe2\x80\x99s, and Forrest Mars Sr. later partnered with the son of a Hershey\xe2\x80\x99s executive to begin production of M&M candies in 1941.\n\nH.B. Reese, who had worked as a dairy farmer and shipping foreman for Hershey\xe2\x80\x99s, launched his own candy company in 1923 and five years later introduced Reese\xe2\x80\x99s Peanut Butter Cups. They later came to be produced by Hershey\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94and one of the top-selling candies in the United States.\n\nFrom its roots more than 5,000 years ago, chocolate has become a big business. According to research by Statista, retail sales of chocolate worldwide in 2016 totaled nearly $100 billion, including almost $25 billion in the United States alone. While the cacao plant is native to the Americas, its cultivation has now shifted to Africa, which is now the source of more than two-thirds of worldwide cocoa production.\n\nWATCH: Full episodes of The Food That Built America online now.""";"Other";"930.txt-Other"

I had been wanting something sweet and since it was so hot outside, I decided I wanted ice cream. At the store, I saw the talenti pints of gelato and thought, ""how cute, I can reuse these."" I chose the coffee chocolate chip and I\'m so glad I did. It is creamy, has a full coffee flavor, and the chips are so thin and small they just melt away. I normally dislike chips in my frozen treats, but like I said, these just melted away nicely. My husband chose a the Belgian chocolate flavor and we were both disappointed with it compared to the coffee one. I ended up having to share mine with him which was fine since it is so rich I could only eat a little at a time.\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by DoctorEsq from Outstanding I have never been a coffee lover. Yes, in today\'s coffee addicted world that\'s strange but there you have it. I am, however, a tried and true Chocoholic. Yet the way Talenti has blended traditional coffee flavor with chocolate chips is truly outstanding. And the texture is perfect ~ a bit more solid then the other chocolate chip flavors especially in contrast to the Mediterranean Mint, Chocolate Chip, Peppermint Bark, etc ~ although all yummy, they melt far to quickly for my taste as I enjoy savoring the experience!! True, I pretty much love just about all the Talenti flavors and eat 1/2 a pint every night for my treat. But Talenti\'s Coffee Chocolate Chip has become one of my favorite flavors!\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by Auditory from This is what coffee flavor is all about In the mid-1960s when I was just a tot, my Sisters used to take me to a little shack that doubled as an ice cream parlor. The place featured a big name ice cream brand that is still one of the major players today. That\'s where I had my first taste of a coffee flavored frozen confection. Regrettably, the band name product today tastes nothing like I remembered it to have been. Fortunately, Talenti gelato has made that memory come back to life. With every spoonful, there is no guessing where the flavor is. Talenti has crafted a frozen dessert with an uncompromisingly strong coffee flavor that punches the tastebuds every time.\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by Kath12 from Delicious! My favorite ice cream flavor since I was young was Mocha. That flavor has disappeared. One night my daughter brought over brownies with a complimentary Talenti flavor. I fell in love with this gelato. Next time I went shopping I decided to buy the coffee with the chocolate chips. The first spoonful brought back the flavor I had longer for. It is now my nightly treat. All I need is 2-3 tablespoons full and I am totally satisfied until the next night. Sometimes I will mix it with one of your vanilla flavors & it is so yummy! No longer am I searching for this delicious flavor. I am totally hooked on Talenti brand gelato. I have enjoyed every flavor so far & I still have many more to try.\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by Baddie13 from Great Ice Cream This ice cream is delicious and is a great blend. I can taste the coffee and chocolate chips great together.\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by Mina from My life is now complete I was having a miserable day and I saw this in the store. Not much of a coffee person unless it\'s loaded with chocolate. Tried this as one of those what-the-hey-I\'ll-give-it-a-try moments and that first taste? [Insert angels singing here] DE-LOVIN-LICIOUS!!! The perfect amount of coffee taste, a ton of chocolate chips so no spoonful is left wanting, and my day got infinitely better after I downed half the jar in five minutes. Perfection in a jar. My only problem is trying to make it last before I can buy more! Yum yum yummy yummy yum! :D\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by best one so far from Best one so far Previous flavors I tried were super hard to open because they spilled gelato on the edge, making it extremely difficult to open. These were finally clean so it was easy to open. That was the first major PLUS in my book. Then I tried the gelato and was so impressed. It\'s the best coffee flavor I\'ve ever tasted. It\'s bolder than any other coffee flavored brands I\'ve tried so far. Normally I don\'t like ""stuff"" in my ice cream/gelato, but the ""chips"" in this one is more like shavings so it\'s not as noticeable (unlike their Double Dark Chocolate gelato which has chucks of chips). Best flavor so far from Talenti.'";"Other";"94.txt-Other"

"958.txt";"b'Cocoa butter composition\n\nPrior to any refining, the fatty-acid composition of the CB used in this study was determined by gas-liquid chromatography. The CB used in this study is mainly composed of stearic acid (37.3%), palmitic acid (25.4%), and oleic acid (33.5%) (Supplementary Table 1), which closely matches typical literature values4. The phosphorus content of the unrefined CB is 88 \xc2\xb1 1 ppm, or 0.263 \xc2\xb1 0.004% equivalent phosphatides by weight (Supplementary Table 2), which is similar to the 0.34 \xc2\xb1 0.07% reported by Arruda and Dimick6. After refining, the phospholipids are completely removed from the CB. The FFA content of the unrefined CB is 1.65 \xc2\xb1 0.01% (as oleic acid) (Supplementary Table 3), which complies with the requirement of having <1.75% FFAs as oleic acid in Codex standards. This is reduced to 0.06% after neutralization and bleaching.\n\nCrystal structure and polymorphism\n\nPowder X-ray diffraction is the most unambiguous method for determining CB TAG polymorphism. In this study, CB samples were melted at 80 \xc2\xb0C for 30 min to clear the memory of crystallization and then crystallized statically at 23 \xc2\xb0C in an incubator for 1 day. Form IV displays wide-angle reflections corresponding to short spacings of 4.35, 4.15, 3.97, and 3.81 \xc3\x85, Form V has short spacings of 4.58, 3.98, 3.87, 3.75, and 3.67 \xc3\x85, while Form VI has short spacings of 4.59, 3.86, and 3.70 \xc3\x8510. Unrefined CB displays reflections corresponding to short spacings of 4.61, 3.88, and 3.71 \xc3\x85, which is characteristic of Form VI, matching literature values closely (Fig. 1; Supplementary Table 4)10. Additionally, the small-angle reflections corresponding to long spacings of 68.16 and 32.89 \xc3\x85 further suggest a Form VI polymorphism and a 3 L structure (polytype)11. CB TAGs in Forms V and VI stack as lamellae in the [001] direction with a dimension, which is proportional to three fatty-acid chain lengths, hence the nomenclature \xe2\x80\x9c3 L\xe2\x80\x9d. Other polymorphic forms stack as 2 L structures, the more common polytypic arrangement12.\n\nFig. 1: Powder X-ray diffraction patterns and differential scanning calorimetric traces (inset) of unrefined native CB, refined CB, and refined CB with added minor lipidic components. Samples included a unrefined native CB, b refined CB, c refined CB with added 0.1% (w/w) dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, and d refined CB with added 0.1% (w/w) dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine. Samples were crystallized statically at 23 \xc2\xb0C for 24 h. Full size image\n\nIn contrast, the refined CB sample displays a pattern that resembles a blend of Forms IV and V. Short spacings of 4.35 and 4.18 \xc3\x85 agree with literature values for Form IV, while 4.60, 3.99, 3.88, and 3.77 \xc3\x85 match those of Form V11. Furthermore, the long spacings include both 2 L (45.20 \xc3\x85) and 3 L (65.57 and 32.69 \xc3\x85) arrangements, indicative of the presence of Forms IV and V, respectively11. Thus, it appears that the removal of minor components in CB through refining drastically changes the crystal structure of CB.\n\nThe wide-angle region of powder XRD spectra of refined CB with minor components added back is generally characteristic of Form V, or a blend of Forms IV and V (Fig. 1c, d and Supplementary Fig. 1 (a\xe2\x80\x93f)). In the small-angle region, diffraction patterns suggest that the 3 L structure is present in all samples. Long spacings in the range 64\xe2\x80\x9368 \xc3\x85 correspond to the reflections of the (001) crystal plane. Higher-order reflections, up to ones corresponding to the (009) plane of this lamellar crystal, are also evident. However, there is also varying amounts of the 2 L structure present in the various samples, specifically Form IV, which imparts undesirable properties and stability to CB and chocolate, including a low melting point and excessive softness12. The DMPC, GMP, GMO, and FFA samples have little to no 2 L structure present, indicated by the lack of a (001) plane reflection corresponding to ~45 \xc3\x85. In contrast, DPPE and GMS CB samples display a strong 2 L reflection, suggesting a mixture of 2 L and 3 L structures.\n\nMelting point and enthalpy of fusion\n\nThe melting points and enthalpies of fusion determined by DSC were compared across the CB samples and are shown in Table 1. Example DSC curves are presented for each sample in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2. Wille and Lutton reported the melting temperatures for Forms I through VI as 17.3, 23.3. 25.5, 27.5, 33.9, and 36.3 \xc2\xb0C10, while Lovegren et al.13 reported lower melting temperatures for the same six polymorphs as 13, 20, 23, 25, 30, and 33.5 \xc2\xb0C. The melting point of the unrefined CB used in our study closely matches that of Form VI, as reported by Willie and Lutton10. However, once the CB is refined, the melting point drops to 28.8 \xc2\xb0C, indicative of Form IV. After adding specific minor components back into the refined CB, the melting temperature increases again. Phospholipid and MAG addition to refined CB yield samples with melting points in the range of 29.8\xe2\x80\x9332.2 \xc2\xb0C, suggesting that the CB crystals are in transition from Form IV to Form V, as reported by Wille and Lutton10. Finally, when FFAs are added to refined CB, the melting temperature increases back to about 34 \xc2\xb0C, which may indicate a mixture of Forms V and VI, as it is also similar to Form VI\xe2\x80\x99s melting point of 33.5 \xc2\xb0C13. These results are all in agreement with the XRD data.\n\nTable 1 Melting point and enthalpy of fusion of unrefined native CB, refined CB, and refined CB with added minor lipidic components. Full size table\n\nThe enthalpies of fusion follow a similar trend, with a higher enthalpy of fusion (143.9 J/g) for unrefined CB, which decreases significantly after refining (110.9 J/g). Again, the phospholipids and MAGs have a much smaller effect, if any, compared to the FFAs. With the FFA samples, the enthalpies of fusion are similar to that of the unrefined CB. Guthrie reported an enthalpy of 147 J/g for Form V CB, which decreased for less stable forms14.\n\nCrystallization kinetics\n\nThe crystallization kinetics of the CB samples were quantified using half-times derived from the Avrami model fitted to the SFC-temperature data, as shown in Fig. 2, with the calculated Avrami constants shown in Supplementary Table 515.\n\nFig. 2: Static crystallization growth curve of unrefined native CB, refined CB, and refined CB with added minor lipidic components crystallized at 23 \xc2\xb0C (symbols) and corresponding fits to the Avrami model (solid lines). The inset table indicates the half-times of crystallization derived form model fits. Refining CB accelerates its crystallization (a), as does 0.1% (w/w) phospholipid addition (b). Addition of 0.5% (w/w) saturated monoacylglycerols, glycerol monostearate, and glycerol monopalmitate, do not significantly affect crystallization kinetics, while addition of the unsaturated glycerol monooletate does (c). Free fatty-acid addition to refined CB at 0.5% (w/w) levels accelerates crystallization for stearic, palmitic, and oleic acids equally (d). Values represent means and standard errors of three replicates and values with the same superscript letter are not significantly different (P > 0.05). Full size image\n\nUnrefined CB has the longest half-time of crystallization at 281.9 min, which decreases to 202.3 min after refining. Statistically significant decreases (P < 0.05) in the half time of crystallization of unrefined CB are observed after addition of DMPC, DPPE, GMO, and all free fatty acids tested, including palmitic, stearic, and oleic acids. Chaiseri and Dimick reported that different phospholipids had different effects on crystallization rate, with certain phospholipids such as lysophosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol retarding nucleation, while others such as phosphatidylcholine promoting nucleation. They also highlighted that removing phospholipids through refining decreased the crystallization rate, indicating that phospholids may be necessary as initial crystallization seeds in CB1. This agrees with the data presented in this study, with the addition of phospholipids increasing crystallization rate. Arruda and Dimick reported a much higher relative concentration of phospholipids in seed crystals than in bulk CB, with the majority being phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine6. Thus, it appears that the added phospholipids may aid in the nucleation of CB TAGs.\n\nThe FFA and GMO CB samples have a slightly shorter half-time of crystallization relative to the refined CB sample, but the effects of palmitic and oleic acid are not statistically significant (P > 0.05). M\xc3\xbcller and Careglio focused their study specifically on FFAs, and reported slower crystal growth of unrefined CB with added stearic, palmitic, and oleic acids7. However, we do not observe this in our study. Chaiseri and Dimick reported that saturated free fatty acids increased the crystallization rate in the early stages of CB crystallization1.\n\nFew studies have been conducted on the effect of MAGs on CB crystallization. Chaiseri and Dimick suggested that their effects are small due to their low concentration in CB1. In our study, GMS and GMP, both saturated monoglycerides, do not significantly affect CB crystallization kinetics. Surprisingly, the unsaturated monoglyceride GMO enhances CB crystallization.\n\nPolarized light microscopy\n\nLight microscopy revealed subtle differences in the microstructure of the different CB samples (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 3). Although all images display feather-like spherulitic structures, the unrefined sample has smaller spherulites. DPPE addition, interestingly, leads to the formation of larger spherulites with a different texture than upon DMPC addition. The spherulites of the refined and DPPE samples display granular structures in the centre of the spherulites and feather-like crystallites in the periphery. The MAG samples all exhibit similar crystal morphologies, with both granular structures and small feather-like spherulites present. This is similar to the stearic and palmitic acid samples, though the FFA samples display a more granular structure. It appears that the MAG and FFA samples, excluding the oleic acid sample, revert the CB to the morphology of the unrefined sample. However, the oleic acid sample differs greatly from the rest, displaying large spherulites analogous to the refined CB sample.\n\nFig. 3: Polarized light microscopy images of unrefined native CB, refined CB, and refined CB with and without added minor lipidic components. Samples included a unrefined native CB, b refined CB, c refined CB with added 0.1% (w/w) dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, and d refined CB with added 0.1% (w/w) dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine. Samples were crystallized statically at 23 \xc2\xb0C for 24 h. Intensity and contrast were auto-levelled. Full size image\n\nAn aspect that became clear during the microscopy studies is that the spatial distribution of mass of CB is affected by the refining process and subsequent addition of minor lipidic components. One way to quantify this spatial distribution of mass is by determining the box-counting fractal dimension (D box ) of the images. A high fractal dimension is associated with a greater fill of the available embedding space with crystalline mass, as well as a higher order in the distribution of this crystalline mass. The box-counting fractal dimension provides a value that quantifies the level of space-filling, as well as self-similarity within a structure, which can be related to the nucleation process of CB. Supplementary Table 6 lists these values. The unrefined and stearic acid samples have the lowest average fractal dimension, with D box = 1.63 and 1.62, respectively. In contrast, the sample with the highest fractal dimension is the refined sample at D box = 1.75, followed by the phospholipid samples at ~1.72. Samples with a higher fractal dimension are expected to have originated from a higher nucleation rate, as this leads to more homogenous growth across an area. On the other hand, slower nucleation rates would result in more heterogeneous growth, leading to a lower fractal dimension for the resulting mass distribution 16.\n\nInterestingly, here we also discovered a statistically significant (r = 0.77, P < 0.01) inverse correlation between the melting temperature of the samples and their fractal dimension, as shown in Fig. 4. This may be related to the polymorphism of each sample and its corresponding nucleation process. For the unrefined sample, a high melting temperature of 36.4 \xc2\xb0C indicates the presence of the Form VI polymorph. The higher free energy of nucleation for this most stable polymorph results in low nucleation rates, leading to a more heterogeneous mass distribution and a lower fractal dimension. Conversely, the lower melting temperature of the refined sample suggests a mixture of Forms IV and V, which are metastable polymorphs. These polymorphic forms have greater rates of nucleation, resulting in a more homogeneous mass distribution and a higher fractal dimension16.\n\nFig. 4: Global relationship between the box-counting fractal dimension (D box ) of polarized light microscopy images of CB samples and their corresponding melting temperature (T m ). Fractal dimension values plotted represent the means of six images, while melting temperature values plotted represent the means of three replicates. Full size image\n\nMechanical properties\n\nThe hardness of both CB and chocolate samples containing some of the minor components was determined by 3-point bending, and the elastic bending modulus calculated. The elastic bending moduli (E B ) of unrefined CB, refined CB, and DMPC CB are 44.1 \xc2\xb1 3.4, 35.4 \xc2\xb1 4.4, and 39.0 \xc2\xb1 3.7 N/mm2, respectively. There is no statistically significant difference between these values (P > 0.05). The melting temperatures for these samples are the same as well, with the average being 34.3 \xc2\xb1 0.1 \xc2\xb0C.\n\nFor the chocolate samples, the addition of phospholipids to molten commercial chocolate (90% cocoa solids) allows the chocolate to maintain hardness without complex tempering procedures, such as crystallization at 5 \xc2\xb0C for 1 h and subsequent storage at 20 \xc2\xb0C for 4 days. Other trials with static crystallization at 23 and 26 \xc2\xb0C yield chocolates with undesirable mechanical and surface properties, suggesting that the use of phospholipids to promote proper tempering still requires some optimization of crystallization temperatures. DMPC and DPPE were added chocolate at 0.1% (w/w) levels, and their properties were compared to commercial chocolate both directly from the package and recrystallized under the same conditions as the doped samples (Table 2). The E B is similar between the commercial chocolate and the phospholipid-containing samples, but is significantly lower for the recrystallized commercial chocolate (P < 0.05). When the chocolate is melted and recrystallized without any additive addition, it becomes much softer. A greater E B indicates a stiffer chocolate, relating to the property of snap, which is desirable in chocolate. However, DSC analysis revealed that all the chocolate samples have similar melting temperatures, all indicative of Form V CB crystals. XRD patterns further confirm the presence of Form V CB crystals in all samples (Fig. 5). Thus, it appears that the polymorphism of CB in chocolate does not wholly determine its mechanical properties, and these mechanical properties may be attributed to the microstructure instead.\n\nTable 2 Elastic bending modulus (E B ), melting temperature, and whiteness index (WI) of commercial chocolate samples with added phospholipids. Full size table\n\nFig. 5: Powder X-ray diffraction patterns for commercial chocolate with added minor lipidic components. Chocolate samples were molten, blended with the minor components and crystallized at 5 \xc2\xb0C for 1 h, followed by 20 \xc2\xb0C for 4 days. The a commercial chocolate, b molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate, c molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added 0.1% (w/w) dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, and d molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added 0.1% (w/w) dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine, all display powder X-ray diffraction patterns characteristic of well-tempered \xce\xb2 2 , triclinic, Form V cocoa butter crystals. This crystal form displays a strong reflection corresponding to a short spacing of ~4.6 \xc3\x85 in the wide-angle diffraction region, and characteristic wide-angle reflections in the 2\xce\xb8 region 20\xe2\x80\x9325\xc2\xb0. In the small-angle diffraction region, only reflections from the 3 L (001) plane corresponding to ~62\xe2\x80\x9363-\xc3\x85 were observed. The absence of reflections from (001) plane of the 2 L polytype indicates the formation of the optimal polytypic form in the cocoa butter in all samples. Reflections at higher angles in the small-angle region correspond to higher-order reflections for these two crystal planes. Full size image\n\nProper chocolate tempering typically focuses on the melting behavior of the chocolate, in other words, the polymorphism of the chocolate\xe2\x80\x99s CB triacylglycerol crystals2,3. However, there is little consideration for the microstructure and mechanical properties when determining whether chocolate has been properly tempered or not. Here we show that addition of DMPC and DPPE helps achieve the desired hardness and fracture properties in chocolate, without directly impacting the polymorphism. This likely results from changes in the microstructure of the underlying CB fat crystal network, which arises from the phospholipids affecting the nucleation behavior of the CB.\n\nSurface reflectance\n\nProper tempering of chocolate results in a smooth surface with high surface gloss17. Bloom, for example, is often characterized by the appearance of a grayish white film on the surface of chocolate, attributed to the uncontrolled polymorphic transformation from Form V to Form VI18. This white appearance is due to the presence of large surface crystals, which scatter light impinging upon them19. This can be quantified using the Whiteness Index (WI), calculated from RGB surface color measurements17. A higher WI indicates a greater level of fat bloom on the surface of the chocolate, or may also indicate a rougher surface. The WI for each of the chocolate samples is shown in Table 2. The commercial chocolate and the DMPC chocolate sample have similar WI, suggesting a properly tempered chocolate for the DMPC sample. Moreover, a statistically significant difference is evident between the DMPC chocolate sample and the recrystallized commercial chocolate sample (P < 0.05), which was not tempered properly. The lower WI of the DMPC chocolate sample suggests that the addition of this phospholipid aided in the stability of the chocolate, resulting in less fat bloom and/or a smoother surface compared to the recrystallized commercial chocolate sample. The effect of DPPE addition to molten and recrystallized chocolate is not as clear since the WI is not statistically different from the commercial, DMPC or molten and recrystallized chocolates.\n\nChocolate microstructure by synchrotron-based micro-computed tomography (SR-\xc2\xb5CT)\n\nSynchrotron \xc2\xb5CT analysis revealed similarities between chocolate microstructure among all samples imaged at a <450 \xc2\xb5m length scale. CT voxel intensity is directly proportional to material density. The number of voxels with a given intensity is then representative of the number of volume fractions with a given density in the analyzed volume. The molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate sample (Lindt-R) displays the largest difference between samples, with a narrowing and shift of the histogram compared to the fresh commercial chocolate (Lindt-F), molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added DMPC, and molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added DPPE. This indicates a difference in material structure upon recrystallization. This is visually represented in volume renderings where the most notable difference is a reduction in the green intensity for Lindt-R, compared to the Lindt-F, DMPC, and DPPE samples, as seen in Fig. 6. Volume rendering movies of each sample can be seen in the corresponding links in Fig. 6.\n\nFig. 6: Volume renderings of reconstructed slices, plotted histograms, and correlation matrix of SR-\xc2\xb5CT data. Samples included a molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added 0.1% (w/w) dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC), Supplementary Movie 1; b molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate with added 0.1% (w/w) dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DPPE), Supplementary Movie 2; c fresh commercial chocolate (Lindt-F), Supplementary Movie 3; d molten and recrystallized commercial chocolate (Lindt-R), Supplementary Movie 4; e plotted histograms, and f correlation matrix. Full size image\n\nA comparison of the histograms shows qualitative differences in the overall density distributions, which make up the sample volumes in the images. A correlation matrix was generated by inputting the voxel count values for each binned 16-bit gray-value and generating a table of correlation coefficients between the four chocolates density distributions. The correlation matrices show a high positive correlation in the material\xe2\x80\x99s density distribution regardless of treatment; however, the least variance is observed between DMPC vs. Lindt-F and DPPE vs. Lindt-F. The highest correlation coefficient is found between DMPC and fresh Lindt, and DPPE vs. fresh Lindt samples, with a value of 0.9987. This suggests that the complex microstructure of Lindt chocolate with added DMPC and DPPE and crystallized isothermally, is more similar to that of tempered fresh Lindt chocolate than without these additives.\n\nOverall, we find that the presence of various minor components within CB results in major changes to its polymorphism, crystallization kinetics, and crystal morphology. By refining CB through neutralization and bleaching, the unrefined CB transitioned from Form VI to a blend of Forms IV and V, in addition to displaying faster crystal growth. Although adding MAGs and FFAs back into refined CB results in some small differences, phospholipid addition has the largest impact.\n\nAt 0.1% (w/w) levels, DMPC and DPPE both significantly increase the crystal growth rate of refined CB. However, the DPPE sample exhibits significant amounts of the 2 L polytype, while the DMPC sample only displays 3 L polytypism, which is the more stable and preferred nanostructure. When added to a commercial chocolate sample, DMPC and DPPE both template the Form V polymorph with optimal mechanical properties, surface gloss and microstructure. This may allow for the production of chocolate products without the need for laborious and complex tempering protocols.\n\nProper tempering is often judged by the resulting melting temperature, a function of the CB polymorphic form2. However, as we show in this study, the various chocolate samples were all in Form V as determined by DSC and XRD analysis, but display different mechanical properties. This suggests that there is more to tempering than achieving the Form V polymorph, and important qualities such as gloss and snap may be heavily dependent on surface and bulk microstructure. Thus, DMPC, DPPE, and possibly other saturated phospholipids can potentially be employed as effective additives for engineering the crystallization behavior, polymorphism, nanostructure, and microstructure in CB and chocolate products.'";"Other";"958.txt-Other"
"96.txt";"b'For a year or so in high school, I\xe2\x80\x99d buy a peanut butter Kudos bar in the cafeteria at lunch time, then eat it slowly on the walk home. Kudos, for those who never had the pleasure, were a kind of granola-candy bar hybrid made by Mars that debuted in the late \xe2\x80\x9980s. Comprising a granola bar topped by a peanut butter layer pebbled with crispy rice, the whole thing enrobed in waxy chocolate, those slim bars fueled my adolescence.\n\nSo maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s no wonder that I\xe2\x80\x99ve been craving the combination of peanut butter and chocolate as I prepare to send my own children back to school \xe2\x80\x94 real, in-person, full-time school \xe2\x80\x94 for the first time in a long time. Kudos have been long since discontinued, but the appeal of a bar made with good peanut butter and excellent chocolate has not gone out of style among children or their mothers, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to report.\n\nThough these bars are inspired by Kudos, they\xe2\x80\x99re not intended to be a replica. I took some liberties: Instead of a granola bar, I make my version with a simple shortbread crust that\xe2\x80\x99s pressed into the pan with your fingertips; it\xe2\x80\x99s sturdy enough to give the bar structure, but with a tender crumb and an irresistible brown butter flavor. I top the crust with a second layer made from a combination of melted natural peanut butter and milk chocolate into which I stir puffed rice (or, if you prefer, Rice Krispies).\n\nI prefer natural smooth peanut butter for almost everything, these bars included \xe2\x80\x94 the milk chocolate gives the mixture plenty of sweetness, and I like its slightly coarse texture; if you want even more texture, use crunchy peanut butter. Almond butter can also be substituted. The bars are finished with a silky layer of dark chocolate, its bitterness acting as a foil for the sweet peanut butter layer. A dusting of finely chopped peanuts adds another textural element.\n\nI cut the bars into squat, skinny bars. While small, they are mighty, rich and intense. An 8-inch pan yields 32 bars, which will keep you going for a while, each one fueling, perhaps, afternoon homework sessions, sports practices, tedious meetings, or long walks home.\n\nJessica Battilana is a freelance writer and the author of \xe2\x80\x9cRepertoire: All the Recipes You Need.\xe2\x80\x9d Instagram: @jbattilana Email: food@sfchronicle.com Twitter: @jbattilana\n\nPeanut Butter-Chocolate Shortbread Bars\n\nMakes 32 small bars\n\nThe crust\n\n1 cup all-purpose flour\n\n\xc2\xbd teaspoon baking powder\n\nPinch kosher salt\n\n8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature\n\n1 large egg yolk\n\n\xc2\xbd cup granulated sugar\n\nThe peanut butter layer\n\n1 cup natural peanut butter\n\n4 ounces milk chocolate, finely chopped\n\n1 cup plus 2 tablespoons puffed rice or Rice Krispies\n\nThe chocolate layer\n\nFood Guide Top 25 Restaurants Where to eat in the Bay Area.

Lightly grease the parchment paper. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit .\n\nIn a medium bowl whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter on high speed until pale and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula and add the egg yolk and sugar and beat on medium-high until the sugar has dissolved, about 2 minutes more. Transer the dough to the prepared pan and refrigerate for 10 minutes. With your fingertips, press into the pan in an even layer (if the dough sticks to your fingers, wet them).

Scatter the chopped peanuts over, then return to the refrigerator and refrigerate until the chocolate layer is set.\n\nTo serve: Remove the bars from the pan using the parchment paper to help lift. While the bars are still cool, use a sharp knife to cut the bars into 1-inch by 2-inch bars. Let come to room temperature before eating.'";"Other";"96.txt-Other"
"966.txt";"b'Is chocolate toxic to dogs?\n\nYes, chocolate is toxic to dogs. While rarely fatal, chocolate ingestion can result in significant illness. Chocolate is toxic because it contains a chemical called theobromine, as well as caffeine. Theobromine is the main toxin in chocolate and is very similar to caffeine. Both chemicals are used medicinally as a diuretic, heart stimulant, blood vessel dilator, and a smooth muscle relaxant. Dogs cannot metabolize theobromine and caffeine as well as people can. That is why dogs are more sensitive to the chemicals\xe2\x80\x99 effects.\n\nHow much chocolate is poisonous to a dog?\n\nThe amount of toxic theobromine varies with the type of chocolate. The darker and more bitter the chocolate, the more dangerous it is to dogs. Baking chocolate and gourmet dark chocolate are highly concentrated and contain 130-450 mg of theobromine per ounce. Common milk chocolate only contains about 44-58 mg/ounce. White chocolate rarely poses any threat of chocolate poisoning with only 0.25 mg of theobromine per ounce of chocolate. Even if the amount ingested is not a toxicity concern, dogs can still become ill from the fat and sugar in chocolate. These can cause pancreatitis in severe cases or in dogs that have more sensitive stomachs. To put this in perspective, a medium-sized dog weighing 50 pounds would only need to eat 1 ounce of baker\'s chocolate, or 9 ounces of milk chocolate, to potentially show signs of poisoning. For many dogs, ingesting small amounts of milk chocolate is not harmful.\n\nWhat are the clinical signs of chocolate poisoning?\n\nClinical signs depend on the amount and type of chocolate ingested. For many dogs, the most common clinical signs are vomiting, diarrhea, increased thirst, panting or restlessness, excessive urination, and racing heart rate. In severe cases, symptoms can include muscle tremors, seizures, and heart failure. Complications such as developing aspiration pneumonia from vomiting, can make the prognosis for chocolate poisoning worse. When in doubt, immediate treatment by your veterinarian is recommended if a poisonous amount of chocolate is ingested.\n\n""Clinical signs of chocolate poisoning can take hours to develop and last for days.""\n\nClinical signs of chocolate poisoning can take several hours to develop. Signs due to large exposures can last for days due to the long half-life of theobromine. This means that it remains in the bloodstream for a longer period. Theobromine may be re-absorbed from the bladder, so intravenous fluids and frequent walks to encourage urination may be necessary. It is important to seek medical attention by calling your veterinarian or Pet Poison Helpline as soon as you suspect that your dog has eaten chocolate.\n\nWhat should I do if my dog eats chocolate?\n\nContact your veterinarian or Pet Poison Helpline to see if a poisonous amount of chocolate was ingested. If a toxic amount is ingested, you should have your dog examined by a veterinarian immediately. The sooner treatment begins, the better your dog\'s prognosis.\n\nWhat is the treatment for chocolate poisoning?\n\nTreatment depends on the amount and type of chocolate eaten. If treated early, decontamination including inducing vomiting and administering activated charcoal to prevent absorption of theobromine into the body may be all that is necessary. Treatments of activated charcoal may be repeated to reduce the continued resorption and recirculation of theobromine.\n\nIt is very common to provide supportive treatments such as intravenous fluid therapy to help stabilize a dog and promote theobromine excretion. All dogs ingesting a toxic amount of chocolate should be closely monitored for any signs of agitation, vomiting, diarrhea, nervousness, irregular heart rhythm, and high blood pressure. Medication to treat restlessness and other signs may also be necessary\n\nI saw a treat made for dogs that contains chocolate. Isn\'t this dangerous?\n\nMany gourmet dog treats use carob as a chocolate substitute.\n\n""Carob looks similar to chocolate and the two are often confused.""\n\nCarob looks similar to chocolate and the two are often confused. Some specialty dog bakeries will use a small amount of milk chocolate in treats. Since the amount of theobromine is typically low, this may be safe for most dogs. However, most veterinarians recommend that you avoid giving your dog chocolate in any form.\n\nPet Poison Helpline, an animal poison control center based out of Minneapolis, MN is available 24/7 for pet owners and veterinary professionals that require assistance treating a potentially poisoned pet. The staff provides treatment advice for poisoning cases of all species, including dogs, cats, birds, small mammals, large animals and exotic species. As the most cost-effective option for animal poison control care, Pet Poison Helpline\xe2\x80\x99s fee of $65 per incident includes follow-up consultations for the duration of the poison case.
